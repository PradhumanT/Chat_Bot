        "Michael: Did you know that in Morocco it is common to exchange a small gift when meeting somebody for the first time? In Japan you must always commit suicide to avoid embarrassment. In Italy you must always wash your hands after going to the bathroom. This is considered to be polite.",
        "Jim: Why are you telling us this?",
        "Michael: I am jetting off on an international business trip.",
        "Jim: Where are you going?",
        "Michael: To Can-A-da.",
        "Jim: Where is it?",
        "Michael: Canada.",
        "Jim: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: My boss is sending me abroad to do a presentation to an international client and I have always been intrigued by all things international. The women, the pancakes, the man of mystery...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Meredith, I would like you to pretend that you are from Abu Dhabi.",
        "Meredith: [British accent] Hello.",
        "Michael: I am ashamed at your naked face. I must cover it with my jacket. [covers Meredith's face with his jacket] You are now sexy in your culture.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: T minus...",
        "Jim: Six point five days. [winces as Kevin smacks him on the back]",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: Pam comes back from New York next week and everyone here has just been so excited for me. And involved. And intrusive. And weird.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phyllis: On more week. [chuckles]",
        "Stanley: Heh heh. [Jim gives camera an odd look]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David Wallace: [on speakerphone] Do you have your passport?",
        "Michael: I have my passport. [pats jacket pocket]",
        "David Wallace: Got your per diem?",
        "Michael: I have my per diem. [holds up money] I already know what I am going to spend this on. I am going to buy a sweater.",
        "David Wallace: Michael, the... that's for your food.",
        "Michael: Well I'll just... I'll use different money for that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David Wallace: I was happy to send Michael on this trip. He's been feeling pretty down since we had to transfer Holly up to New Hampshire. But this little perk really seemed to turn him around. [chuckling] And it's pretty tough to find somebody who wants to go up to Winnipeg mid-November.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: And business class air, like a five-star hotel in the sky, nothing but the best. Actually better than a five-star hotel 'cause you get a big, cushy seat and you sit in a row of people and to eat, whatever the mind can imagine. I think I am going to have a filet with mushroom sauce.",
        "David Wallace: Well, I'm just glad to know you're happy because you know I felt bad.",
        "Michael: Well that is all in the past.",
        "David Wallace: And in terms of nightlife, when you get there just ask the concierge.",

        "Michael: I do. It's right here. [indicates to waist]",
        "Dwight: No, no, no, no, no. You want to wear that puppy right up on the breastbone like a bra. [demonstrates]",
        "Michael: No, I don't want to wear a bra.",
        "Dwight: Here, let me help you. [reaches for Michael's money belt]",
        "Michael: Stop it! Stop it!",
        "Dwight: Do you want to get robbed in a foreign country? I wash my hands of this.",

        "Andy: Meaning I will try to get other dudes laid.",
        "Michael: Yeah baby! That's what I'm talking about. That could be you [points at Jim] if you hadn't forgotten French. Where is my numbers man?",
        "Oscar: Here.",
        "Michael: There we go. Our town car awaits.",

        "Oscar: I made egg salad sandwiches. Do you want one? [holds up sandwich]",
        "Michael: Could you have picked something stinkier to bring on a plane? [Andy laughs] My God, Oscar. Really? Do you have a bag of baby poop in there too, to share with everybody? No, I will be ordering my own food, thank you very much.",
        "Michael: [to stewardess] Hi.",
        "Beth: Hi.",
        "Michael: Um. I'd like to see a menu please.",

        "Michael: Oh... okay. [looks back at Andy and Oscar] Doesn't matter, because I am going to take a nap. I think I am going to use my complimentary blindfold. I will don it... and oh! Look at that. I can't see because I am in a-- [cart crashes into Michael's leg] GAH!",
        "Beth: What would you like to drink?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ryan: [walks into Kelly's cubicle and sets a box down on the desk] Just checking out where I'm going to be pretty soon. When Pam gets back. Gonna be close quarters. Gonna be a lot of tension.",
        "Kelly: For you. I'm with Darryl.",
        "Ryan: This looks like where I'll probably do my pushups every day. [gets on floor and starts doing pushups]",
        "Kelly: Is that supposed to impress me? [Ryan starts trying to do one-armed pushups]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: [talking head] No. Not going to happen. He has hurt me too much and too often. And I am in a healthy relationship so I'm not gonna flaunt it and I'm not gonna hurt him, but that door is closed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: [making out with Ryan on her desk] What are we doing? This is so wrong.",

        "Concierge: Down here... the financial district.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: A concierge is like the Winnipeg equivalent of a geisha. This is a woman who has been trained in the fine art of fanciness and pleasure. And when you meet one, it is intoxicating. Just what the doctor ordered.",

        "Jim: It's not--- It's not about me. I mean, this your dream.",
        "Pam: [over phone] I know.",
        "Jim: And you went to New York to do this. So when you come back you come back the right way. Right?",
        "Pam: [starting to cry] Right.",
        "Jim: [concerned look on face] You okay?",

        "Michael: Thank you, Andy.",
        "Marie: Thank you?",
        "Andy: Let me get a picture of you guys.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Everyone is going to end up dying someday. And I think it's better to die with people you like... like Oscar, and Andy, and concierge Marie... than to know that there's somebody out there that you love that you're not with.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: Alright, I've scoped out the joint. Those two dudes are as good as naked.",

        "Guy at table: What?",
        "Andy: Do you like apples?",
        "Guy at table: Uh, sorry... what?",
        "Andy: Well, how do you like these apples? [sets drinks on table] Alright, on a scale of 1 - 10, how hot is that dude? [indicates towards Oscar who waves slightly]",
        "Guy at table: Is he your boyfriend or something?",
        "Andy: No, but he could be yours if you play your cards right.",
        "Guy: Dude, leave us alone alright?",

        "Andy: What do I see in Angela?",
        "Oscar: I want to know.",
        "Andy: I see through a hard exterior to a little jelly in the middle. She is teaching me to be a better person. And she's working really hard on that. And she has the softest skin I've ever seen and I can't wait to have s*x with her.",
        "Oscar: You haven't had s*x?",

        "Andy: What is wrong with you?",
        "Oscar: Why won't you do Andy?",
