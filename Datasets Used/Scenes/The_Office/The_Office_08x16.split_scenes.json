        "Angela: So cute.",
        "Oscar: Hey, you guys want to see a picture of Gerald wearing galoshes? He refused to go out in the rain until I bought these. Now going out in the rain is all he wants to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Oscar thinks that having a dog is just like having a baby.",
        "Angela: News flash - If you didn't carry it around for nine months, it isn't your kid.",

        "Dwight: Pretty good.",
        "Nellie: Well thank you. This is very helpful feedback. [Dwight raises his hand] Dwight, I am still not ready to name a VP.",
        "Dwight: [laughing] That's not what I was going to ask. Gosh, jump to conclusions. Come on, I know, you've got so much on your plate. Right now, you're like 'oh, what's more important? Dwight's question, figure out who's the VP?' Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP.",
        "Nellie: I can't be hypnotized, Dwight. I tried it, I ended up smoking more.",

        "Jim: Hey, how's it going?",
        "Cathy: Hey, uh, good. Uh, the heating system though in my room is all messed up. It's like 90 degrees in there. Maintenance is working on it. Can I hang out here?",
        "Jim: Uh... yeah, I'm just watching basketball.",
        "Cathy: Okay, yeah.",
        "Jim: Okay.",

        "Angela: Is this spicy?",
        "Brandon: No, baby girl. It would be messed up if I didn't find anything, but I did, so-",
        "Andy: I'm pretty sure if Darryl sent Val a text, it was about some paper emergency or something.",
        "Brandon: At midnight?",
        "Andy: ... yeah...",
        "Kevin: It happens! Like a hospital needs more napkins for surgery...",
        "Kelly: Guys, we're not gonna settle anything this way. I think we just need to be grown-ups here.",
        "Andy: Thank you.",
        "Kelly: I thin we're gonna need to here those texts.",
        "Andy: Kelly, remember how you wanted to go home before?",

        "Erin: Whoa. the lights are still on.",
        "Ryan: Yeah, they keep them on 'cause it's less expensive than turning them on and off.",
        "Erin: I like how guys just know stuff all the time.",
        "Ryan: Girls know a lot of stuff too, okay? And nobody knows more than you. Especially me.",
        "Erin: [gasps] Hello, waffle iron.",

        "Darryl: \"You're such a great friend, dot dot dot dot dot.\"",
        "Kelly: Five dots, Darryl, are you kidding me? Okay, 'cause three dots means 'to be continued', four dots is a typo, but five dots means \"Whoa, do not make me say what I want to say, baby, but if I did, it would blow your mind, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.",
        "Everyone: Oh...",
        "Brandon: See? Yes. Thank you, sister.",
        "Val: Brandon, Darryl and me? That's ridiculous, right?",

        "Gabe: Well, then you have to call me by my name. Gabriel Susan Lewis.",
        "Dwight: I gotta be gone for a few minutes. You make sure that Packer does NOT sleep with Nellie.",
        "Gabe: What's in it for GSL?",
        "Dwight: You really want Packer as your boss?",
        "Gabe: Got it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: If Jim has bedbugs, that means they're everywhere. I can't risk them coming back to Schrute Farms. Our biggest attraction is our 200 year old mattresses.",

        "Dwight: Where did you see it?",
        "Jim: In the bed.",
        "Cathy: I haven't seen anything.",

        "Dwight: Describe it.",
        "Jim: Brown, shiny, painful bite.",
        "Dwight: Could be a bat weevil... Describe its mood. Did it seen sleepy?",
        "Jim: Stressed, but to be fair, it was a tense situation.",
        "Dwight: Fair enough, but after it bit you, did it run away fearful, or did it walk away smug, self-assured?",
        "Jim: So smug. Like he thought it was funny, like this.",
        "Dwight: Pshh. That's a bedbug.",
        "Jim: Yeah.",
        "Dwight: Everything's a joke.",
        "Jim: I know.",
        "Dwight: Check your hair! [checks Jim's hair]",
        "Jim: Ow.",
        "Dwight: God, oh. So greasy, you should just shave all this.",
        "Jim: Just check it.",
        "Dwight: You are clean. Okay... One thing a bedbug thrives on is heat and carbon dioxide [starts running in place and turning up the thermostat] I am going to generate myself into a human trap. [starts to take off clothes] When I jump into the bed, you are going to cover me with the sheet immediately. And then we'll see who's laughing. [dastardly laugh]",
        "Jim: Alright.",
        "Dwight: Yeah. [jumps into bed] Cover me!",
        "Cathy: Is this really nessecary?",
        "Jim: He knows what he's doing.",
        "Dwight: Let the bedbugs bite!",
        "Cathy: Ugh, god, I feel so gross. I have to go take a shower.",
        "Jim: Alright, then I will catch you later... What do we do now?",

        "Dwight: Nope, I wasn't bitten.",
        "Jim: Well, maybe it isn't warm enough in here.",
        "Dwight: Oh, it's plenty warm, and I was farting continuously under the sheet, creating a kind of greenhouse effect.",
        "Jim: Come on.",
        "Dwight: If there were any in here, They would've imbedded themselves in me.",
        "Jim: You know what? Maybe they just ate.",
        "Dwight: No, you're good. Clean bill of health! Besides I gotta get back downstairs. I left Packer alone with Nellie for way too long.",
        "Jim: Okay, they're fine. They're adults.",
        "Dwight: No, that's the problem. Packer is trying to bed Nellie for the VP job unless I do it first.",
        "Jim: Is that really how you want to get this job?",
        "Dwight: Such a chorus girl.",
        "Jim: Okay, Dwight... Dwight... Dwight, Dwight Dwight!... uh...",

        "Cathy: [giggles] Wait, this why I exercise like a fiend. Feel. Seriously.",
        "Jim: Okay alright. [gets up] I'm really sorry, uh, I just have to say it. I'm-I'm married. I'm very happily married.",
        "Cathy: Oh my God, what are you thinking?",
        "Jim: um... I mean-",
        "Cathy: I know that you're married, I sat at your wife's desk. How little do you think of me?",
        "Jim: I'm sorry, I feel like maybe I'm-I'm I misread things. Okay, let's just go back to watching.",
        "Cathy: Can you... without running to the other side of the room all night?",
        "Jim: Yes, I can. [Cathy laughs] uh, all right. I'm really sorry. I think we'll just... we'll just watch. You can watch, not watch, whatever you want to do. Take another shower, I don't care.",
