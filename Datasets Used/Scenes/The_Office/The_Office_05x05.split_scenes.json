        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: In my opinion, the third date is traditionally the one where... you have s*x. Does Holly feel that way? I don't know. I will probably find out tonight. If she starts having s*x with me I'll know for sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: That's for you. And, um, oh. I am right in assuming that Dwight is short for D-Money. 'Cause that's what I wrote on your save-the-date.",

        "Phyllis: You know I know. [looks at the camera guys] You know they know.",

        "Holly: Oh, the mall could be fun.",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Holly: We could go to the food court and get different foods. You could get Chicken Teriyaki. I could get a hot dog.",
        "Michael: Some of what we order depends on whether we're having s*x after. [laughs] Oh, my. Wow, elephant in the room. Are we, do you think? Do you think we're going to have s*x tonight?",
        "Holly: ...Hell yeah.",
        "Michael: Okay, so, we do the restaurant thing and then... then... then we can do... We'll just do the restaurant thing first.",

        "Phyllis: Okay.",
        "Dwight: I just don't get it.",
        "Phyllis: What don't you get?",
        "Dwight: Why is she marrying Andy?",
        "Phyllis: Angela's not really a risk taker. And Andy's not really a risk.",
        "Dwight: That's really fattening.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: [playing cards] It's time to go.",
        "Michael: No. No. Reservations are at 8:00, so we've got like an hour and 45 minutes. [sighs] [goofy voice] I'm a crazy eight, I'm crazy.",

        "Holly: I didn't forget my keys, I just didn't want to make out with you in front of the cameras. Do you think they can hear us?",

        "Michael: We're totally alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Angela: Yes, that's correct. I need to cancel checks from 10,001 to 90,000.",
        "Oscar: Great, they stole my laptop.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, well, they stole my surge protector.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Oh, my God, what happened?",
        "Jim: We were robbed last night.",
        "Dwight: Bravo, Watson. Looks like a classic seven-man job. Okay, security tapes were stolen, Motives-financial, or possible, vintage HP computer collectors. Hank down at security had clocked out. And that's all we have.",
        "Holly: Can I talk to you for a second?",
        "Michael: Yeah. Oh... oh!",
        "Holly: That wasn't us, right? I mean... you remembered to lock the doors?",
        "Michael: No, did you?",
        "Holly: Michael I think this is our fault.",

        "Pam [on phone]: Scranton.",
        "Jim: The future mother of my children.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Angela: I never felt safe here.",

        "Angela: I would very much like that.",
        "Andy: Yeah?",
        "Angela: Yeah.",
        "Andy: [cockney accent] Consider yourself... at home!",
        "Dwight: [Dwight groans] Ugh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: Get in.",
        "Phyllis: Where are we going?",
        "Dwight: I know she loves me, Phyllis. I am sure of it. She practically told me so.",
        "Phyllis: Then you need to give her an ultimatum. Tell her she needs to make a choice. You or Andy. If she pick you, great. If not, you can move on.",
        "Dwight: Are you sure that's going to work?",
        "Phyllis: It did when Bob said I had to stop talking to my sister on the phone so much.",
        "Dwight: Wait, this isn't our floor. Dwight...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: How's everyone doing? My door is always open if anyone wants to talk.",
        "Oscar: I don't want to talk. I want my laptop back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Creed: Nobody steals from Creed Bratton and gets away with it. The last person to do this disappeared. His name? [whispering] Creed Bratton.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: We're gonna make everything all right. Alright? Conference room, 15 minutes. Half an hour. Alright?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: To recoup their losses, I am planning a little charity auction, where people from all over Scranton can come and bid on our goods and services. I'm calling it crime-aid. It's like farm aid, but instead of farms fighting against AIDS, it is us fighting against our own poverty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phyllis: I think it's a fun idea.",
        "Michael: Thank you.",
        "Phyllis: We could auction off things we do for each other like cleaning or tennis lessons. My sorority did it all the time.",
        "Michael: Okay, I'm gonna have to stop you right there. Was this a sorority that you didn't get into a real sorority so you had to kind of form your own?",
        "Phyllis: Move on, Michael.",
        "Michael: Okay. Okay! Well, come on, let's have an auction. Let's do this. We'll auction off people like in the olden days.",
        "Oscar: So, in order to recoup the value of items we liked, we have to spend more money on things we don't want. Who would ever come to this?",
        "Michael: I don't know, it could be any number of people. It could be a pedestrian. It could be an old person. It could be a lookie-loo. Or, it could be... a Bruce Springsteen fan - what? Who said that? I did. Why did I say that? Oh, I think you know why I said that. I think it is very apparent. I think it goes without saying. Bear with me. There's a point there. But what is the point? I don't understand what he's saying. It seems a little shady. It seems a little foggy. Well, it's not a little foggy there's actually something going on here-",
        "Jim: Do you need us for any of this?",
        "Michael: Do I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: Michael scored the big ticket item. Springsteen tickets! The boss scored the boss.",
        "Michael: Yeah, I think that's pretty boss.",
        "Holly: He knows how to get things. He got me.",
        "Michael: Whoa!",
        "Holly: [giggles] Sorry.",
        "Michael: Twice. ... Right?",
        "Holly: Mm-hmm.",
        "Michael: Mm-hmm.",
        "Holly: Mm-hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: Listen to me close. 'Cause I'm only gonna say this once. You either break off your engagement with that singing buffoon, apologize, and then date me, or you can say good-bye to this. [points below his belt]",
        "Angela: I think you have me confused with another person.",
        "Dwight: I said I was only gonna say this once. You have until 6:14 PM. 6:14!",
        "Angela: I heard you. [quickly walks away]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Pump it up! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! [Huey Lewis' Heart of Rock and Roll plays] Pump up the volume. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, Mr. Springsteen. [music stops] And welcome to C.R.I.M.E.-A.I.D. [clears throat] Crime Reduces Innocence Makes Everyone Angry I Declare. It is not known how many office robberies occur every second because there is no Wikipedia entry for office robbery statistics. However, tonight, its victims, are standing together and standing strong in the form of song, cooking lessons, and hugs. Really Phyllis? You're auctioning a hug? Okay, so with no further ado, lights, camera, auction! Take it away Bruce! [Huey Lewis' Heart of Rock and Roll plays]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Phyllis: It's the only gavel I could find.",
        "Michael: It squeaks when you bang it, that's what she said. Let's hear it for me! Right? A bargain at any price!",
        "Darryl: Hey Mike, do my thing.",
        "Michael: Oh, yes, great. Very good, Um, so, Darryl, and the boys in the hood in the warehouse, have graciously donated to, uh, go out for a beer with them right now. You know what, I'm actually going to bid on this. I'm going to start the bidding, because this is something that I have dreamt of-",
        "Darryl: Mike, you can't do that. It's conflict of interest.",
        "Jim: 5 dollars.",
        "Darryl: Sold! To Jim.",
        "Michael: Okay. Okay, sold! Have fun, you guys. Well, this next item is sure to spring steam from your ears if you don't win it. It just says \"Creed.\"",

        "Phyllis: Well, I just think we all deserve to be with someone who wants to be with us.",
