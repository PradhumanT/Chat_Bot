        "Kelly: And it was so funny 'cause we were at this bar with his friends and I was sitting next to him the whole night and he wasn't making a move, so in my head I was like \"Ryan, what's taking you so long?\" And then he kissed me. And I didn't know what to say.",
        "Jim: Wow.",
        "Kelly: So I said, \"Ryan, what took you so long?\" And I just said that to him, can you believe that?",
        "Jim: Wow.",
        "Kelly: Oh my God, Jim, is that embarrassing? I'm embarrassed.",
        "Jim: No, don't be.",

Most people when they come to New York, they go straight to the Empire State Building, that's pretty touristy. I come here. Great places to eat. [points] We have Bubba Gump Shrimp, Red Lobster down there. Ya know. This is, this is the heart of civilization, right here.",

Scranton is great, but New York, is like Scranton on acid, no on speed, no on steroids. [Michael sees it's the end of a street.] OK, umm, I think, that's either the Hudson or the East, so we're back, should be back this way. There's a lotta pressure on me right now. It's like Michael Jordan, in the NBA finals. Or, like Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as it's over, we will not have to deal with those Iraqis anymore. Let's do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: [on phone] Nah that's alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. That's fine. No, I didn't even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye.",

        "Michael: You have been kicked out of every strip club in Albany, is that true?",
        "Craig: Guilty, yeah.",
        "Michael: So what's going on? What I miss?",
        "Josh: Not much, they're uh, I guess running late upstairs, so we're just waiting for the presentations.",
        "Michael: Cool. Good, good, good. Give us some time to catch up, and... [awkward silence]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Pam: You need to get something for your girlfriend.",
        "Dwight: [same time as Pam] Girlfriend. Yes, and the reason I didn't get anything for this particular person - who shall remain nameless - is that she's not really the kind of person you'd think would be into Valentine's Day. She's kind of...",
        "Pam: Tightly wound?",
        "Dwight: (smirking) Exactly.",
        "Pam: Ok, well, sometimes the gift is really about the gesture, you know, like what it means, instead of what it is.",
        "Dwight: You mean, like a ham?",
        "Pam: No, not like a ham. It's about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her.",
        "Dwight: Ok, I get it.",
        "Pam: That you remember her.",
        "Dwight: Ok, shut up. I know exactly what to do. [gets up and leaves]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: What about you, Craig, you lose anyone?",
        "Craig: Oh man, Jan, called me in September and said \"You gotta fire four people,\" and I was just like, \"What?\" Ya know?",
        "Josh: Did you?",
        "Craig: No, I just ignored her. She's the worse.",
        "Josh: She is our boss.",
        "Craig: She ain't my boss dude. I don't work for that bitch.",
        "Michael: Ay, Kay. Come on, you know, that's not. Cool it.",
        "Craig: What? You like Jan? How can you like Jan?",
        "Michael: Maybe because she's my girlfriend. [starts retracting statement] Was, or not my girlfriend. She's... we hooked up and...",
        "Josh: You hooked up with Jan?",
        "Michael: You know, months ago, just once, It's, just stupid. Just forget it,",
        "Josh: Yeah, let's change the subject.",
        "Michael: Yeah, yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: I don't know what he's thinking, but I would just be so psyched if we just dated forever.",
        "Jim: Take it slow. 'Cause it seems like a lot of the time things like that need... [Ryan walks in]",
        "Ryan: Soda.",
        "Kelly: [to Ryan] Cool. Hey, so... do you want to... do something tonight? Or...",
        "Jim: [under breath] Oh, no, not while I'm here.",
        "Kelly: I mean, I know it's Valentine's Day, or whatever, but there's totally no pressure at all, of any kind. What so ever. So...",
        "Ryan: I can't tonight. I have plans with my friends.",
        "Kelly: OK, That's cool. I completely understand.",

        "Michael: Ditto. [to Jan] How are you Jan?",
        "Jan: Fine Michael. Thank you.",
        "David: OK. So we are in the process of doing a complete review of the company's financial strengths. All I'd like to do today is to...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jan: Nervous, no I'm not nervous. Well, I guess I'd be lying if I didn't say I was a little nervous. Umm, the new CFO is judging me on this too, and well, it is Michael, so. Yeah, I'm very nervous.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josh: So with the twelve new local accounts, we had a total of four percent organic growth, which was just above our pre-year targets.",
        "David: Thanks very much.",
        "Josh: Thank you.",
        "David: OK, Michael.",
        "Michael: What is a business? Is it a collection of numbers and sales reports? Sure. But as you know, David and Jan, it is much more. [plays video on screen. David and Jan have confused looks on their faces.]",
        "Michael: [video dialogue for \"The Faces of Scranton\"] Life moves a little slower in Scranton, Pennsylvania. And that's the way we like it. Because at Dunder Mifflin Scranton, we're not just in the paper business, we're in the people business. Let's meet some of the folks that make the Scranton branch so special. [video shows Stanley at desk] This is Stanley Hudson, one of our talented salesman. An African-American father of two, Stanley's dedication is no doubt one of the hallmark's of the foundation of the business we're hoping to build our bases on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Yeah, I shot a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my Mac. I was thinking of entering it into some festivals. Probably won't. You know, not what this is about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: [video dialogue] And finally, Pam Beesly. Look at her. Look how cute. Not bad at all. As the receptionist, Pam is truly the gateway to our world. Well, I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. What it's like to walk a mile in Oscar's shoes. Or try on Phyllis' pants. Maybe even one of Angela's famous brownies. And you'll know, that you're home. [video says, \"Great Scott!\"]",
        "Michael: Questions?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: Wow. OK, OK, thank you Michael, that was great.",
        "Michael: Yes, thank you.",
        "David: But, for right now what, I would really like to know about is the branch's performance, so do you have that information as well?",
        "Michael: Yes, absolutely David. Get that for you. I umm... [hands over report]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Delivery man: [with flowers] Can you sign?",
        "Pam: Yeah.",
        "Pam: [delivering plant to Oscar's desk] Oscar.",
        "Angela: Nothing for me?",
        "Pam: [walks away] Join the club.",
        "Kevin: Whose it from? [to Oscar]",
        "Oscar: My mom. [puts card in pocket]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: It's frustrating, because we'd be so perfect together.",
        "Jim: You know what? Here's the deal, Kelly. It would be really nice if he was in to you, right? It'd be great, but he isn't.",
        "Kelly: Yeah, it would be so great if he was.",
        "Jim: Well, he's not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on. Try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight.",
        "Kelly: Okay, cool. Is it okay if I invite Ryan? [Jim leaves]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dan: And that about does it, thank you.",
        "Jan: OK. [looks toward Craig] Craig,",
        "Craig: Yeah. Here's the deal. I did not understand this was supposed to be a full on... like report or whatnot.",
        "Jan: Um, I'm sorry, what did you think financial presentation meant?",
        "Craig: I was under the impression this was, more of like... a meet and greet type deal.",
        "David: So, does that mean you don't have the numbers on your branch?",
        "Craig: That is correct, yes.",
        "Jan: Craig, you realize that we're trying to decide whether if drastic steps need to be taken?",
        "Craig: Look, I'm sorry, I didn't know.",
        "Jan: Well, the point is, is that doesn't exactly bode well for your branch.",
        "Craig: Oh man, you know what? Michael made that stupid movie, he doesn't get into any trouble? Maybe I should have slept with you, too. [David looks at Jan, who glares at Michael.]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Oh, ok. Alright.",
        "Jan: NO, NO I'm not, I'm not, I just... I just don't know what to do anymore, Michael. I mean, we're all gonna get fired.",
        "Michael: No you're not.",
        "Jan: Yeah, Michael - the CFO thinks that we slept together. Do you understand, people get fired for much less? And I just [scratches head] can't believe that you told everybody and we didn't even sleep together.",
        "Michael: Technically, we fell asleep in the same bed. So...",
        "Jan: Oh, God. Michael. It was months ago. It was once, It's over. Do you understand?",
        "Michael: Yes. I'm sorry. I will fix this. I'll talk to him. I'll talk to David.",
        "Jan: Surely, you cannot be serious?",
        "Michael: I am serious. And don't call me Shirley. Airplane.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: Women are like wolves. If you want a wolf, you have to trap it. You have to snare it. And then you have to tame it. Keep it happy. Care for it. Feed it. Lovingly, the way an animal deserves to be loved. And my animal deserves a lot of loving.",

        "Roy: Hey babe.",
        "Pam: Hey.",
        "Roy: You almost ready to go?",
        "Pam: I guess, yeah.",
        "Roy: What's wrong?",
        "Pam: Nothing, it's just I had to sit here all day, while Phyllis got like an entire garden delivered to her.",
        "Roy: What, you're mad at me?",
        "Pam: I mean, I know that we said no big gifts, but I was kind of hoping you'd get me something for Valentine's Day.",
        "Roy: Well, Valentine's Day isn't over. Let's get you home and you are gonna get the best s*x of you life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "David: You understand this is a very serious situation.",
        "Michael: No no no no no, yes I, OK, well, alright, here's the deal. It's my fault. This is, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke and Craig the idiot took it seriously. [Jan looks at Michael]",
        "David: You made a joke?",
        "Michael: I did, it was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool. [David grins]",
        "David: Well I don't need to explain to you that even a joke about sexual relations with your boss...",
        "Michael: I know. It was borderline at best and... And Jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um, I'm really sorry. It will never happen again.",
        "Jan: Uh, that's fine. Let's just forget it.",
        "David: Good. [Michael leaves office]",

        "Michael: Oh, no big deal. Really. Sorry again.",

        "Michael: Yeah, Happy Valentine's Day. [Jan turns and then kisses Michael. Michael looks and sees camera, Jan turns and sees camera, too. Elevator door closes.]",
