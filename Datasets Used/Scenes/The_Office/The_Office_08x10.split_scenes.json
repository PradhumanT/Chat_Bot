        "Andy: [Singing as if he were the dolls in his office] Christmas tiiiime is heeeere! [Normal voice] Wow. Thanks guys, that sounded amazing. Hi, I'm Andy Bernard and I am the first office Santa ever to make holiday wishes come true.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: Who's excited to get their holiday wishes?",
        "Stanley: Holiday wishes.",
        "Andy: What's that, Stanley?",
        "Stanley: We know exactly what holiday you're referring to.",
        "Andy: It is important to be mindful of all belief systems at our holiday party.",
        "Stanley: I've been here eighteen years and have suffered through some weird thematic Christmases. A Honolulu Christmas, A Pulp Fiction Christmas, A Muslim Christmas, Moroccan Christmas. Mo-rocca Christmas. I don't want it. Christmas is Christmas is Christmas is Christmas.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: I got Stanley tickets to see Lewis Black for his birthday. ...Might not have been the best idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stanley: I don't want no Kwanza wreath, I don't need a dreidel in my face, that's it's own thing. And who's that black Santa for?! I don't care! I know Santa ain't black! I could care less. I want Christmas! Just give me plain baby Jesus, lying in a manger, Christmas!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meredith: What is the status on my wish?",
        "Andy: Fulfilled! Brought my bicycle, so I can be your designated driver later. In the event that you drink to much, which is by no means required.",
        "Dwight: What about my wish that we don't have to attend meetings that degrade our sense of adulthood?",
        "Andy: That, I cannot do, but I did get you an acre of property on the moon.",
        "Dwight: Where? Dark side or light side?",
        "Andy: Light side.",
        "Dwight: Is it by the Sea of Tranquility?",
        "Andy: As a matter of fact, yes. Directly adjacent....beachfront.",
        "Dwight: Thank you, Andy.",
        "Andy: So, who's wish is next? Oh, what about Santa's wish? My biggest wish is that you all get along well with Jessica....C'mon guys, Jessica?...Jim, tell 'em who Jessica is.",
        "Jim: She's not your grandmother, is she?",
        "Andy: Ugh! Gam-gam's name is Ruth, Jim, you should know. I introduced you on speakerphone that time?",
        "Jim: Yeah.",
        "Andy: Jessica is my super serious girlfriend, who is seriously awesome and seriously sexy. Only thing that's not serious, by the way? Our repartee.",
        "Creed: That's great. When you know you know. Hey, what's Ruth's deal, man?",
        "Andy: Totally out of your league. So in summation, ho ho ho, please be nice to Jessica and mistletoe is not an excuse for sexual assault, and don't go near Gam-gam.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Erin: I love Jessica, and I haven't even met her yet. It's like we don't even need to meet, you know? I already love you. Stay home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: I just want you to know that I will be mean to Jessica if you want me to be.",
        "Erin: Oh no, no. It's fine, Kelly.",
        "Kelly: It's really no problem. I was already planning on being mean to her.",
        "Erin: That's OK, I don't want you to do that.",
        "Robert: [laughing] Hello, ah. Merry Christmas, Erin. Kelly, Happy Pancha Ganapati.",
        "Kelly: Eww, what is that?",
        "Robert: The five day Hindu celebration in December honoring the god Ganesh, Patron of the Arts.",
        "Kelly: Cool.",
        "Kevin: Hey, man.",
        "Robert: Hey! [Kevin embraces Robert in a tight hug] Oh!",
        "Kevin: How ya holdin' up...because of your wife leaving you?",
        "Oscar: Kevin?",
        "Robert: I actually appreciate the human intimacy. Feel like a kitten being cradled by a gorilla.",
        "Kevin: Yeah.",
        "Robert: It's been ten days since I had sexual intercourse.",
        "Andy: Well you came to the right place....Ah, this, this party'll cheer you right up.",
        "Robert: I hope so. The corporate party was wretched. I am so tired of the Black Eyed Peas. It's rock-n-roll for people who don't like rock-n-roll. It's rap for people who don't like rap. It's pop for people who don't like pop.....ah, heartbreaking. [gestures to Andy in Santa costume]",
        "Andy: Oh, thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: Well, I hate to have to take my Santa hat off, and put on my hard ass hat. [puts on baseball cap that has a foam rear-end on it with the words \"HARD ASS\"] But, this is serious. It's come to my attention that somebody who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps.",
        "Dwight: Fine with me. Jim can leave anytime he wants. Goodbye.",
        "Jim: It wasn't me.",
        "Andy: It wasn't either of you.",
        "Jim: Kathy wants to leave our clump?",
        "Andy: Sh sh sh sh! Don't look. Who it was is not important...but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he.",
        "Dwight: I just wanna say, this is not my fault. OK? The weak always bully the strong. Contrary to what you see in the media. I am always acting in self-defense. Occasionally preemptive self-defense. [punches Jim in the arm]",
        "Jim: Ow, What are you doing? [Jim fights back]",
        "Andy: Hey! Hey! Respect the hat!",
        "Jim: Pam never seemed to have a problem with us.",
        "Andy: Alright. I'm gonna speak in a language you both understand....Mo-nay.",
        "Jim: What was that?",
        "Dwight: What is it?",
        "Andy: Money....You both have sizable Christmas bonuses coming your way. If I catch either of you messing with the other, I will give both bonuses to the other person.",
        "Jim: Can't do that.",
        "Dwight: No, absolutely not.",
        "Andy: You need consequences. OK? I want you both walking on eggshells.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Hi. I'm Jessica. I'm looking for Andy?",
        "Erin: Jessica. Yes. We don't say hi, we hug. [gets up and hugs Jessica] I'm Erin.",
        "Jessica: Oh! [laughs] Oof!",
        "Erin: Sorry, hi, I hope you feel really welcome, we all want you here.",
        "Jessica: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: My ex is meeting my s*x....which is always scary, you know? And not just because you think they might talk about your pen1s...that's just part of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: Hey! Jess, Erin, I hope you're not talking about my pen1s. [laughs and kisses Jessica on the cheek] Hi.",
        "Jessica: Hi.",
        "Andy: Hey everyone! I want you to meet Jessica, she is an assistant cross country coach at Bryn Mawr.",
        "Erin: Wow.",
        "Andy: Erin, by the way, amazing receptionist.",
        "Jessica: Oh, that's great. Backbone of the office.",
        "Erin: Which is funny, actually, because my spine is a mess.",
        "Andy: What?",
        "Jessica: Oh.",
        "Erin: Scoliosis. Had to wear a back brace for three years but I never did. [Jessica laughs, Erin exaggerates back curve]",
        "Andy: Oh no.",
        "Jessica: Ah..[laughs]",
        "Andy: Ut oh, it's kicking in. Spontaneous scoliosis.",
        "Jessica: Spontaneous scoliosis. [both laugh]",
        "Erin: Oh.",

        "Darryl: Alright.",
        "Val: Alright.",
        "Darryl: Oh yeah, and um there's a Christmas party upstairs tonight, wanted to tell you about.",
        "Val: Isn't that just for popsicles?",
        "Darryl: Popsicles?",
        "Val: Yeah, upstairs people? Cause you got a stick up your butt?",
        "Nate: Ah! See, I, I, I thought it was because they're so rich they could all eat popsicles all the time. [laughs] I, in my, I...",
        "Darryl: Well you should definitely come. The foreman always comes. Plus it's fun, you know cookies, smoked fish, alcohol, people acting stupid.",
        "Nate: You had me at \"clookies.\" I can't wait to find out what they are.",
        "Val: What should I wear?",
        "Darryl: Oh, it's nice, it's real nice. People get dressed up.",
        "Nate: I will look so handsome for you, Darryl.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: Dwight really wants my bonus. He's trying to entrap me. Oh god, now I can't drink at this thing....I get really pranky when I drink.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Robert: Erin, what can I get for you?",
        "Erin: Uh, do you have cola? Kirkland if you have it.",
        "Robert: Now why would you come to a bar and ask for a cola when you can get some from the kitchen? Did some small part of you want something a little stronger? Ryan, Kevin, Phyllis, Oscar, come and take these shots!",
        "Ryan: Yes!",
        "Oscar: Yes!",
        "Ryan: Will do.",
        "Robert: The fifth one is for you, Erin. You could take it or leave it. To take it would be to accept that you're at a party and you're an adult woman, with an adventurous spirit. To leave it would be fine too.",
        "Phyllis: One, two three! [group takes shots]",
        "Kevin: Yes.",
        "Erin: OK. [takes shot, group laughs]",
        "Robert: Mmm. Wow.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers, to my wife...from me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: [laughing] Boom!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ryan: But look, it's Christmas, so you're allowed...[Val walks in dressed very formally] whoa, hello. Um, you're allowed to do...",
        "Kevin: Good cookie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Darryl: I meant dressed up compared to normal. You usually dress like a ghost-buster.",
        "Val: OK.",
        "Darryl: I thought you'd wear a sweater.",
        "Val: Since when does a sweater mean \"dressed up\"? Am I your grandson?",
        "Darryl: Come on, stay, alright? It's good for people to get to know you.",
        "Val: As a contestant on Dancing with the Stars, maybe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Erin: A thousand.",
        "Andy: Whoa! Maybe you should take a break.",
        "Erin: [serious] Maybe you should mind your own business. [normal voice] Just kidding!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: Ah! I've been attacked! Oh my god! Oh! Someone put a porcupine in my drawer!",
        "Toby: Oh my god.",
        "Dwight: Yeah, I was just sitting here at my desk and I, I reached into my drawer to grab my toothbrush and some tooth powder and, and all of a sudden I was attacked by this blood thirsty rabid creature!",
        "Jim: I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine?",
        "Dwight: Or who in this office knows that I have access and is trying to set me up?",
        "Jim: Hmm...",
        "Toby: You know this sounds a lot like the premise of my latest Chad Flendermen novel. A murder for framing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Toby: Chad Flendermen. Just an easy going black guy, he knows the streets, yet he also went to Oxford. So. Just as comfortable on a motorcycle as he is on Air Force One. Oh and he's also the world's leading Egyptologist.",

        "Angela: Toby! Nobody cares about your sex-crazed black detective.",
        "Toby: No, no, no, no, no. Women chase him. He misses his wife.",
        "Dwight: Hello? Lacerated hand here folks.",
        "Jim: Nice try, this is ridiculous.",
        "Dwight: Oh is it really? Two separate times you have set me up to believe I was being recruited by the CIA.",
        "Jim: Three times.",
        "Dwight: You see?",
        "Andy: Jim, this has your fingerprints all over it.",
        "Jim: Andy, you've gotta be kidding me.",
        "Toby: Fingerprints can be planted. You know with a severed hand...",
        "Kelly: Do you think that's what happened? Do you think he used a severed hand?",
        "Jim: OK, you know what? Why don't we just call animal control...",
        "Dwight: Might wanna run that by Angela cause it's so cute.",
        "Angela: No. Porcupines don't have souls. They're like dogs.",
        "Jim: [on phone] Yes, I'm calling from Dunder Mifflin. We have a very rabid porcupine in our office, someone should come pick it up.",
        "Dwight: Come down right away!",
        "Jim: [on phone]Uh, I don't know, let me ask. [to Dwight] Uh, were you quilled?",
        "Dwight: Yes, I was quilled.",

        "Jessica: [laughs] Thank you.",
        "Erin: I hope you guys get married....and who knows? Maybe at the wedding, I meet someone.",
        "Andy: OK!",
        "Erin: And later on tonight, I hope I see you guys kiss. [blows kisses and pushes Andy and Jessica's faces together.] Ah! [laughs] OK, well I'm gonna go do another reverse spit. That's how the cool kids say \"get a drink\". [blows kisses and dances away]",
        "Jessica: That's uh, that's the girl you dated.",
        "Andy: Um, yeah, she's not always like that. It's um...",
        "Jessica: No, she, she seems fine.",
        "Andy: Yeah, uh, excuse me.",
        "Jessica: OK.",

        "Erin: Hey.",
        "Andy: Have you had anything to eat besides candy canes?",
        "Erin: Every martini has an olive.",
        "Andy: OK...maybe I should make you some oatmeal or something.",
        "Kevin: I don't wanna put you out, but if someone's making oatmeal, I'll take a apple cinnamon and a maple brown sugar in one bowl with whole milk.",
        "Erin: Hey, I never told you my Christmas wish.",
        "Andy: Ah, OK.",
        "Erin: It's about you.",
        "Andy: That's not what it should be, it should just be like a trinket or something.",
        "Erin: [slurring slightly] It's that I wish Jessica was dead.",
        "Andy: You you, wait. You mean you wish she wasn't here or something.",
        "Erin: I wish she was in a graveyard! Under the ground...with worms coming out of her mouth.",
        "Andy: Hey, you know, you can't say that, OK? That's my girlfriend that you're talking about. You and I are not together anymore. You need to get over it! Take your wish back.",
        "Erin: Too late! It's already been wished! And you promised it would come true. You wrote it in an email! So, which one are you? A murderer or a liar? [Andy leaves]",
        "Kevin: Hey.",
        "Erin: Hey.",
        "Kevin: So, there was talk of oatmeal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Andy: I swear...",
        "Jessica: Did you not...",
        "Andy: I was too embarrassed! [group laughs]",
        "Jim: Hey guys, sorry to interrupt, I uh, just found this on my desk. [shows picture of Cici with devil doodles] Need to talk to somebody about it. Can you believe that?",
        "Phyllis: Is that Cici?",
        "Jim: Yes. It is.",
        "Andy: Um.",
        "Phyllis: That's awful.",
        "Andy: Cici is Jim's daughter.",
        "Jessica: Oh my god. How could somebody do that?",
        "Jim: I know, I mean the way I see it is you can deface any picture of me, any one, pick one. Not my kid though.",
        "Oscar: Who did this? Who did this? Do you know who did this?",
        "Jim: I don't-",

        "Jim: O...K.",
        "Andy: It's, I mean.",
        "Jim: Let me just see that one more time. Yep, you know what? I know who my friends are, now. But I shouldn't have got you involved because the truth is, I don't even really care about this picture, it's a little out of focus. It was probably an accident, right? Like...",
        "Oscar: That's no accident.",
        "Jim: Right. You're right. So maybe it was me who did it...by accident.",
        "Phyllis: What?",

        "Jim: Yes.",
        "Andy: Do you think two friends who are not sleeping together can stay friends?",
        "Jim: Two friends who are not sleeping together, can they remain friends? Yes, yeah.",

        "Jim: OK.",
        "Andy: By the way, I'm not gonna mess with you and Dwight's bonuses. I think it's causing more problems. So just be yourselves, have fun, and try not to let it affect your work.",
        "Jim: Alright. I will definitely do that.",
        "Andy: Alright, I'll tell Dwight.",
