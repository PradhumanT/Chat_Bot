        "Michael: Hey, hey how is Alan? Tell Alan that the Mets suck! Okay? From me, big time. Go Pirates!",
        "Jan: I'm not going to do that Michael.",
        "Michael: Okay",
        "Jan: We've created an incentive program to increase sales.",
        "Michael: Uh, huh.",
        "Jan: At the end of the month you can reward your top seller with a prize worth up to a thousand dollars.",
        "Michael: Whoa. Howdy-ho. Wow, a thousand big ones. That's cool. Do I uh, do I get to pick the prize?",

        "Michael: No, no, no. No vendors in the office. That is a distraction.",
        "Pam: Okay, I told her you'd talk to her.",
        "Michael: Pam. Pam. Come on, I'm busy. So just tell her to go away.",
        "Pam: Okay.",

        "Katy: Wow, thanks.",
        "Pam: There's an HR meeting in there at 11:30.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: I do. I read Small Business man. I also uh, subscribe to USA Today and American Way Magazine, that's the in-flight magazine. Some great articles in that. They did this great profile last month of Doris Roberts and where she likes to eat when she's in Phoenix. Illuminating.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: This is my conference room. So please, uh, make yourself at home. Whatever you need, I'm right on the other side of this wall. [knocks on wall] used to be a window here. There's not anymore. So, that's where I will be.",
        "[Katy unpacks her handbags]",
        "Michael: So if you need anything else, something to make you more confortable just don't hesitate to ask. I'm right here.",

        "Michael: Wait a second. I should have spotted another addict. Uh, gotta love the 'bucks.",
        "Katy: What?",
        "Michael: It's like a slang for Starbucks. They're all over the place. Oh, man, that place is like the promised land to me. What a business model too. Ah, too bad we don't have the good stuff here.",

        "Michael: Nah, it's not. it's spppplllibbb",
        "Katy: No really it is.",
        "Michael: No, here's the thing. Y'know I do my best to be my own man and go by the beat of a different drummer and nobody gets me, and they're always putting up walls and I'm always tearing 'em down, just breakin' down barriers, that's what I do all day. So a coffee, regular coffee for you. High test, or unleaded?",
        "Katy: Bring it on.",

        "Pam: No.",
        "Kevin: She's prettier than you though.",
        "Pam: That's a very rude thing to say, Kevin.",
        "Kevin: [nods]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katy: So do you like the periwinkle and the purples?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: The purse girl hits everything on my checklist. Creamy skin. Straight teeth. Curly hair. Amazing breasts. Not for me, for my children. The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies.",

        "Katy: Gosh, I would love to but, my purses, I should, um...",
        "Michael: Oh, um, well, we could have Ryan take a look. Ryan, would you look after the purses, please?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: You should sell a lot here because this branch made over a million dollars last year. Not that we're all millionaires. I'm probably closest. So here's Oscar. Oscar, this is Katy.",

        "Michael: Oooh-ooh. Oscar the grouch. Right? I thought of that.",
        "Katy: That was on Sesame Street.",

        "Roy: Hey, Jimmy what do you think of that little purse girl, huh?",
        "Jim: Cute, sure, yeah.",
        "Roy: Why don't you get on that?",
        "Jim: She's not really my type.",

        "Jim: Hmmm, I don't think so. Nope.",
        "Kevin: What is your type?",
        "Jim: [glances at Pam] Moms, primarily. Yep. Soccer moms. Single moms. NASCAR moms. Any type of moms, really.",
        "Roy: That's disgusting.",
        "Kevin: Stay away from my mom.",
        "Jim: Too late, Kev.",
        "Roy: [Katy walks through breakroom] Man, I would be all over that if I wasn't dating Pam.",
        "Pam: We're not dating, we're engaged.",
        "Roy: Engaged, yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: Pam and I are good buddies. I'm sort of Pam's go-to guy for her problems. You know with stuff like work, or uh, her fiance Roy. Or uh... Nope, those are pretty much her only two problems.",

        "Dwight: Assistant to the Regional Manager.",
        "Jim: Well, you know what Dwight? He's your work boss, okay? He is not your relationship boss.",
        "Dwight: That's true.",
        "Jim: Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about, You're both um, salesmen. I mean that's something right there.",
        "Dwight: True. Plus I can talk to her about the origins of my last name.",
        "Jim: It's all gold.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katy: Guys are usually my best customers, they buy the high end stuff like the beads and the sequins and stuff. For gifts, you know? They don't know what they are looking at. So I make suggestions.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: Alright. Here's the thing okay, you just keep talking to her. If you hit a stall you have a perfect fall back.",
        "Dwight: What's that?",
        "Jim: You buy a purse.",
        "Dwight: I don't want a purse. Purses are for girls.",
        "Jim: Dwight, that's not necessarily true. Do you read GQ?",
        "Dwight: No.",
        "Jim: Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright? Lots of guys have them.",
        "Dwight: Like those?",
        "Jim: Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her.",
        "Dwight: Okay, I'm just going to use the bathroom, and then I'm going...",
        "Jim: No. You don't need the bathroom. You've got it. Go.",

        "Jim: Okay, shhhh stop... stop whatever you're doing because this is going to be good.",
        "Pam: [smiles]",
        "Jim: [mimicing Dwight in high-falsetto voice] Hi my name's Dwight Schrute and I would like to buy a purse from you. Good lord, look at these purses! This is something special. Oh my God is this Salvatore Di-chini-asta?",
        "Pam: [mimicing Katy] Oh definitely, definitely step in and out of it like that.",
        "Jim: Yes, well I want to stress test it. You know, in case anything happens.",
        "Pam: Oh!",
        "Jim: Oh! That was really. [Dwight hits purse against table] This is necessary to do to really give it a good workout. This is the ooooh... This is the prettiest one of all.",
        "Pam: Oh...",
        "Jim: I'm going to be the prettiest girl in the ball. Oh, how much?",

        "Katy: Congratulations. You need a hot date more than anyone.",
        "Pam: I wished, right?",
        "Michael: Giggle-giggle, juji-juji, I get it, I get it. Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood over here right? [to Katy] So how's that uh, coffee from earlier?",
        "Katy: Good.",
        "Michael: Ah, I knew it. Guzzled it down. You greedy little thing. So, uh, Pam is this your lunch break, or was that earlier when you were eating in the kitchen with those guys?",
        "[Pam sheepishly hands Katy the purse and leaves]",
        "Katy: [whispers] Sorry.",
        "Michael: Busted.",
        "Katy: [to Pam] Come back...",
        "Michael: Oh hey, I want to show you something. Come here I want to show you something. I know you are going to like this. Picked it up today. A thousand big ones.",
        "Katy: Is that from Starbucks?",
        "Michael: Yes. This is a Starbucks digital barista. This is the mack daddy of espresso makers.",
        "Katy: Wow. Is that for the office?",
        "Michael: Oh, I know what you're thinking. You're not prying this out of my hands, but don't tempt me because I'll give it to you!",
        "Katy: I wouldn't think of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Coffee is the great incentivizer in the office. It's a drug. It is quite literally a drug that speeds people up. It's not the only drug that speeds people up. You hear stories about Dunder Mifflin in the eighties before everybody knew how bad cocaine was. Guh. Man, did they move paper!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: [Katy reading text message on her phone] Oh the rotating um, steam wand. [Katy looks annoyed] What? What's the matter?",
        "Katy: Oh, nothing. My ride just bailed on me.",
        "Michael: Oh, oh! God. I'm sorry. Is there...?",
        "Katy: Oh no, it's um...",
        "Michael: Where you going? Nearby? Because I can give you a ride.",
        "Katy: No...",
        "Michael: Seriously. No, really.",
        "Katy: No. I really don't want to inconvenience you.",
        "Michael: God! No, no, no, no. No inconvenience. I mean I'm out of here at five sharp.",
        "Katy: At five?",
        "Michael: I can go earlier. 'Cause I'm the boss. You know, whatever. I'm out of here slaves.",
        "Katy: Okay.",
        "Michael: What?",
        "Katy: Okay, I guess that would be, I guess that would be okay.",
        "Michael: Okay. Sounds good. Sounds good. Five o'clock sharp. I will give you and your purses a ride home.",
        "Katy: Okay. Cool.",
        "Michael: Excellent.",
        "Katy: Cool.",
        "Michael: Great. Cool. Cool. [takes deep breath - looks at camera] Yeah, okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: I should have never let the Temp touch this thing. I had all these great icons and now I have four folders. So..",
        "Dwight: It's actually better this way.",
        "Michael: No it's not. Because I could just click on the icon and then I'm onto---",
        "Dwight: Michael could I ask you something? I wanted to ask your permission to ask out Katy. I know it's against the rules and everything. Because...",
        "Michael: No, no, no it's not against the rules. She's not a permanent employee so it's not.",
        "Dwight: Thank you, Michael. I appreciate this so much.",
        "Michael: But I think you should just know that I am going to be giving her a ride home later.",
        "Dwight: What?",
        "Michael: She asked me for a ride and so I am going to give her a ride home.",
        "Dwight: Is that all it is? Just a ride home? Like a taxicab?",
        "Michael: Well, might be a ride home. Might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot-dot-dot...",
        "Dwight: Please. Please, I am your inferior and I'm asking you this favor. Can you promise me that it will just be a ride home?",
        "Michael: No. I cannot promise you that.",
        "Dwight: You cannot promise me, or you won't promise me?",
        "Michael: Listen, Dwight.",
        "Dwight: Do you love her?",
        "Michael: [laughs] Dwight, no. I don't know. It's too early to tell. I don't know how I feel. [Dwight sadly looks away]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katy: I think you've made a really good choice, she's really going to like that.",
        "Stanley: Hmmm...",
        "Michael: Espresso?",
        "Katy: Oh, thank you.",
        "Michael: You're welcome. Thank you. Hmmm-hmm-hmm.",
        "Stanley: Is that from the machine that was in your office?",
        "Michael: Ummm-hmmm...",
        "Stanley: I thought that was the incentive prize for the top salesperson.",
        "Michael: Very easy to clean.",
        "[Stanley walks out]",
        "Michael: Okay. Like he's going to win anyway, right? [laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Did we get any mail?",
        "Pam: Yeah, I gave it to you.",
        "Michael: Yes you did. Yes, you did. Just checkin'. Just checkin', double checkin', checkin' on the check. Thoroughness is very important in an office and...",
        "Pam: So, can I..? [points to the door]",
        "Michael: Yeah, yeah, of course. Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: A futon?",
        "Pam: [nods]",
        "Jim: He's a grown man",
        "Pam: That's what he said.",
        "Jim: That's sad. Or it's innovative. Well, you know the futon is a bed and couch all rolled into one. [Jim sees Roy and trails off]",
        "Roy: What's up?",
        "Pam: [not looking at Roy] Hi.",
        "Roy: Are you still mad at me?",

        "Pam: Stop. [giggling]",
        "Roy: Huh? huh? Come on... Come on, Pammy I was just kidding.",
        "Pam: [breathless] Stop, I can't breathe.",
        "Roy: I was just kidding. You know I didn't mean it. I can't...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Jim is a great guy. He's like a brother to me. We're like best friends in the office and I really hope he finds someone.",

        "Katy: You seem to like to touch things. Did you try the velvet?",
        "Angela: I don't like to necessarily touch things. I'm just... I'm shopping.",
        "Katy: Oh no, it's fine that you, um. Here, what about the raspberry one? It's really uh, kind of festive. It's got a lot of personality.",
        "Angela: Yeah, uh no.",
        "Dwight: Hey, how's it going? Good. Can I talk to you for a second? In private?",
