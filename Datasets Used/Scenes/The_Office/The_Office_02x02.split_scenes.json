        "Toby: Just to refresh you... .",
        "Michael: NO!",
        "Toby: on our policy.",
        "Michael: What? He! No! Okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes?",
        "Toby: Maybe not some of them. Maybe not inappropriate ones.",
        "Michael: There is no such thing as an appropriate joke. That's why it's a joke.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Everyone! Hello! Everyone. Hi! Sorry to interrupt. I know you're all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption. But Toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day. [to Toby] So, take it away.",
        "Toby: Yeah, okay. Corporate would like us to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy so I'll go over that later.",
        "Michael: I wish you luck, Toby. I really do. But you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and I just can't wait to see how you handle it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: A guy goes to a five dollar... lady of the night and he gets crabs. So, the next day he goes back to complain. And the woman says \"Hey. It was only five dollars. What did you expect? Lobster?\" This is what's at stake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Time to bring out the big guns. I'm heading down to the warehouse where jokes are born. Find a killer joke that'll just blow everybody away at the seminar later. And remind them what is great about this place. So... ah! Here they are. [to Warehouse guys] Guys! Wondering if I could, uh, get your help for something. I'm looking for a new joke to tell and it needs to be just killer. And it does not need to be clean. So whatcha got?",
        "Darryl: Like a joke? A knock-knock joke?",
        "Michael: Um, yeah, no, well... I mean better. Better than that. The type of stuff you guys tell all day.",
        "Darryl: Well, [points at Michael] those are some awful tight pants you have on. Where'd you get em? Like Queers R Us?",
        "Roy: Boys R Us!",
        "Warehouse Guy: Oh!",
        "Michael: Alright, alright. Well, yeah, but, you know... a joke but not necessarily at my expense.",
        "Darryl: Man, we can see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide the... good thing you don't have a lot of business to start with.",
        "Michael: Oooh, okay. That was still about me.",
        "Roy: Hey, hey, hey.",
        "Michael: What?",
        "Roy: So you don't have the biggest package. Don't feel bad.",
        "Michael: I don't feel bad.",
        "Darryl: [fake whispers to Roy] I think he feels bad.",
        "Michael: No, I don't.",
        "Roy: You look like you feel bad.",
        "Michael: Okay.",

        "Kevin: MILF!",
        "Pam: Thanks, Kevin.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Usually the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: She's coming in today and maybe just don't joke around about that stuff in front of her.",
        "Toby: Great point.",
        "Pam: Thank you.",
        "Toby: Um... in fact, basic rule of thumb, let's just act everyday like Pam's Mom's coming in. All right. That's it. Um... if anybody has any questions about anything, you know where I sit in the back.",
        "Michael: Hi, is it over?",
        "Toby: Uh, yes!",
        "Michael: No.",
        "Toby: I can go over it with you.",
        "Michael: I know, I know. It's good. It is not over. It is not over til it's over.",
        "Toby: It's over.",
        "Michael: Did he tell you everything? Obviously, he didn't because you all still look relatively happy. Albeit bored. Do you realize what we're losing? Seriously?",
        "Angela: Email forwards.",
        "Michael: Exactly! Mmwwah [blows kiss to Angela]! Can we afford to lose email forwards? Do we want that?",
        "Angela: I hate them. You send me these filthy emails and you say forward them to ten people or you'll have bad luck.",
        "Michael: Give me a break. Umm... Stanley, how about that hot picture you have by your desk? Centerfold in the Catholic schoolgirl's outfit? I mean, it is hot, it is sexy, and it turns him on. And I will admit, best part of my morning is staring at it. But what? Are we just going to take it away?",
        "Stanley: That is my daughter. She goes to Catholic girls' school. I am taking it down right now.",
        "Meredith: Um... what about office romance?",
        "Toby: Office relationships are never a good idea. Yeah. So let's just try to avoid them. But, um, if you already have one, you should disclose it to HR.",
        "Phyllis: All relationships? Eh, even a one-night stand?",
        "Michael: I think the old honor system was just fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee. And, believe me, I could have.",
        "Dwight: Yeah, Meredith.",
        "Michael: No! No! Catherine. Remember her? Remember how hot she was?",
        "Dwight: Yes.",
        "Michael: She would have definitely slept with me.",

        "Jim: I'm in an office relationship. It's special. Um... she's nice. She's shy. She's actually here. You want to meet her? Hold on one second. Oh, my God! Put on a shirt! Put on a... . I told you that you'd be on camera. I'm sorry, she's European. No, I told you that you'd be on camera. Stop it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: What if Pam was a lesbian? What if she brought her \"partner\" in to work? [to Toby] Would that be crossing the line?",
        "Toby: No.",
        "Michael: What if they made out? In front of everybody?",
        "Toby: Well, that would be...",
        "Michael: At home? And I told everybody everything about it.",
        "Toby: Okay, I'm lost.",
        "Michael: Okay. Well, then let's act it out. Pam, you will be girl A and girl B will be... Okay! We'll use the doll. Pam. Pam?",

        "Michael: I wish Todd Packer was here because he would love this. I wonder if anybody else would like to do this. Hey! Um... we have to watch, uh, Toby's video that he's showing us in order to brainwash us and I was wondering if anybody would like to join in? Going to be fun. Got my great pizza. Whataya say? Jim?",
        "Jim: No, thanks. I'm good.",
        "Michael: That's what she said. Pam?",
        "Pam: Uh... my mother's coming.",
        "Michael: That's what she sai [clears throat] Nope, but... Okay. Well, suit yourself.",

        "Toby: Hey Dwight.",
        "Dwight: You said that we could come to you if we had any questions.",
        "Toby: Sure.",
        "Dwight: Where is the clitoris? On a website, it said at the crest of the labia. What does that mean? What does the female v*g1n* look like?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Toby: Technically, I am in Human Resources. And Dwight was asking about human anatomy. Um... I'm just sad the public school system failed him so badly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Toby: Yeah, maybe when you get really comfortable with each other, you can ask for that.",
        "Dwight: Good. Good. And...",
        "Toby: I should get back to work.",
        "Dwight: Okay.",

        "Darryl: Yes, this is the one.",
        "Roy: No!",
        "Darryl: You remember? Yes!",
        "Roy: At the party?",
        "Warehouse guy: You banged her?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: When I said before that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I don't come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldn't arrest a guy who's just delivering drugs from one guy to another.",

        "Jan: You seem a little bit agitated, Michael. What's the problem?",
        "Michael: The problem is that I am the boss and apparently I can't say anything.",

        "Michael: Attention, everyone! Hello! Ah, yes! I just want you to know that, uh, this is not my decision, but from here on out... we can no longer be friends. And when we talk about things here we must only discuss work-associated things. And, uh, you can consider this my retirement from comedy. And in the future, if I want to say something funny or witty or do an impression, I will no longer, ever, do any of those things.",
        "Jim: Does that include 'That's What She Said'?",
        "Michael: Mmmhmm. Yes.",
        "Jim: Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so...",
