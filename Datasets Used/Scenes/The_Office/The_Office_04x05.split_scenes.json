    "Recap": [
        "As the new brainchild of Ryan, the new Dunder Mifflin Infinity website, is about to be released, the staff of Dunder Mifflin Scranton prepare to host a party as part of a company-wide video chat room. Dwight, wanting to prove to Angela that he can beat technology, tries to outsell the new computer, which he ultimately does. Michael misunderstands an invite to the digital party as an invite to the actual party in New York. Later, at the party, Dwight and Michael kidnap a pizza delivery boy, although they later release him. At the end of the chat room, Michael humiliates Ryan in front of every branch of Dunder Mifflin. Andy decides to pursue Angela, to Dwight's dismay."

        "Michael: And the same thing goes for quarterly reports. They are unreadable. They're just numbers and boring and blech. So what I was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic, like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud? And... when we have a good quarter, fireworks? Or a racecar? [everyone groans] Doesn't have to be a racecar. Use your imagination.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: There's this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day, and sometimes it looks like it's heading right into the corner of the screen, and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away. And we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner. Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay. I believe she thinks she saw it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: I saw it. I saw it, and it was amazing! Who said I didn't see it? Did Jim say that I didn't see it? I saw it!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: We have a lot of colored paper here... why oh why do we keep printing this on white? [screen saver box hits the wall]",
        "Andy: Dah! Come on!",
        "Michael: Yeah! I know. I know. It's bland.",
        "Oscar: It's never gonna happen.",
        "Kevin: Dude, you gotta believe.",
        "Michael: Maybe, we could have some sort of riddle?",
        "Jim: [to Pam] Wait for it.",
        "Michael: Like, something that you have to look for. Sort of a \"Where's Waldo.\" [screensaver box hits the corner of the screen]",
        "Everyone: Oh! Yes!",
        "Michael: [everyone gets up and leaves the conference room] Alright. Alright. Let's quit while we're ahead.",
        "Kevin: That was so awesome.",
        "Michael: That was awesome. Thank you.",

        "Jim: Hey Meredith, how you feelin'?",
        "Meredith: I never thanked you for coming to the hospital.",
        "Jim: Oh, please, it was my pleasure. Well we all came, so...",
        "Meredith: Well, I really appreciate you coming. I'm singling you ouuuut.",
        "Jim: Haha...",
        "Meredith: Anyway, I have this Sharpie...",
        "Jim: Uh-huh.",
        "Meredith: And I was wondering if you could sign my cast?",
        "Jim: MmmHmm...",
        "Meredith: [lifts up dress to expose cast on pelvis] Can you write where I can read it?",
        "Jim: Oh yeah.",
        "Meredith: [whispers] I'll read this when I get home.",
        "Jim: Alright...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Michael? This is the press release I was telling you about. Ryan wants you to share it with everyone.",
        "Michael: Oh, does he?",
        "Pam: He does.",
        "Michael: Mmmmmm. Okay. Attention. Earthlings. I have some news. Beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep. Okay. Today is the big day that I am heading to New York to attend a party with sushi and important people. On an unrelated note, if anyone has an interesting anectdote that is not boring and easy to memorize please drop by my office before I leave. Thank you.",
        "Jim: Whoops. Is that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us?",
        "Michael: And... today the Dunder-Mifflin Infinity website officially launches.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Well the website is the brain-child of my brain-child, Ryan. It is my brain-grandchild. And, uh, to celebrate it's birth, all of the different branches are going to have satellite parties, which will be connected via web-cams and fibers to the real party, which is going on in New York City at uh, a very exclusive nightclub, and that is where all of the VIP's, including yours truly, will be partying with uh New York City's finest, and I do not mean policemen...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: The company is projecting record high sales, and that by 6:00 the website will be the new best salesman in the company. Wow! Watch out Dwight.",
        "Dwight: That's ridiculous. I'm not going to be beaten by a website.",
        "Jim: Actually it sounds like you are.",
        "Dwight: Really? 'Cause Ryan says so?",
        "Kelly: If that's from Ryan, does it mention if he's seeing anybody?",
        "Michael: No. It doesn't. I'll find out tonight.",
        "Stanley: Yes, please let us know.",
        "Dwight: I can make more sales than a computer. In fact, I challenge that website to make more sales than me today.",
        "Angela: Waste of time.",
        "Michael: What's that, pipsqueak?",
        "Angela: Waste of time. The website's going to win.",
        "Dwight: You believe a computer can beat me?",
        "Angela: I don't care, but yes.",
        "Dwight: Well I will prove you wrong.",
        "Angela: I don't care, and you won't.",
        "Dwight: We'll see.",
        "Angela: I won't be watching, and I won't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Dwight mercy killed Angela's cat. It's very complicated. It's caused a lot of unpleasantness between Dwight and Angela. Who are both already prone to unpleasantness.",

        "Stanley: No I'm not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ryan: Yeah. I created a website. Look, at the end of the day, apples apples flying at 30,000 feet. This is a paper company and I don't want us to get lost in the weeds or into a beauty contest.",
        "Voice of Thomas Dean: I told you I don't want you doing these things in here. You can use your own office or do it in the hall.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ryan: Convergence. Viral marketing. We're going guerrilla. We're takin' it to the streets while keeping an eye on the street. Wall Street. I don't want to reinvent the wheel here. In other words, it is what it is. Buyin' paper just became fun.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: And this is where I will record your sales.",
        "Dwight: Hmm. Very nice. Very nice.",
        "Andy: And then I will say something positive, like kudos or job well done.",
        "Jim: Or zipadeedoodaah.",
        "Andy: I can't tell if he's mocking me.",
        "Dwight: Just ignore him.",
        "Andy: Ehh, can't do that. Really hard for me to let things go.",
        "Jim: I was... mocking.",
        "Andy: Thank you.",
        "Dwight: I just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when I make a sale.",
        "Andy: Yes like a chime or a bell...",
        "Jim: Or a gong.",
        "Dwight: Go to my car. Open the trunk. Inside you will see many pelts. Under the smallest one is a case. Inside that case is a bear horn. Bring it to me.",
        "Andy: Yes!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Isn't 7 pm a little late for a lunch party?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phyllis: So how do you feel about the fact that the banner says lunch?",
        "Angela: I feel angry. Angry at you. Angry at you for doing something stupid. Angry at me for believing you could do something not stupid.",
        "Phyllis: I'm so sorry to hear that, that must be awful.",
        "Angela: It is awful. You've made this day awful!",
        "Kevin: Maybe you could just change the U into an A.",
        "Angela: Then it would say lanch party, Kevin. Would it really be better if it said lanch party?",
        "Michael: Ohh, lunch party.",
        "Angela: It's supposed to say launch!",
        "Michael: Okay, wow! Easy, booster seat, nobody cares about this party anyway.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Angela: Plan a party, Angela. Oh! And the entire world will see it. Oh! And here's $65.00 for your budget. Oh and here are four idiots who'll do nothing but weigh you down. Oh. And your cat's still dead.",

        "Dwight: Today I'm prepared to give you 15% off our normal prices.",
        "Jim: What?",
        "Pam: He's going through a break-up.",
        "Jim: Yeah, I'm aware of that. But he's also being super annoying. And I'm not a perfect person.",

        "Dwight: It appears that the website has become alive. This happens to computers and robots sometimes. Am I scared of a stupid computer? Please. The computer should be scared of me! I have been salesman of the month for 13 out of the last 12 months. You heard me right. I did so well last February that Corporate gave me 2 plaques in lieu of a pay raise.",

        "Dwight: No, I realize you normally reorder in November, but what I'm suggesti... you did what? Ah no! That's exactly what you're not supposed to do, damnit! Why would you reorder from a computer when you can have the personal touch of a salesman? Ahhhhh. [hangs up phone]",

        "Pam: Here's a suggestion computer. I assume you read binary so why don't you zero one one, one one one one, zero one one zero one one.",
        "Jim: Okay. Um, while you were typing that I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything. And mastered the violin. Oop, and sold more paper.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Angela: I asked for assorted cutlery and I got back spoons. These are worthless.",
        "Phyllis: I want to understand what you're saying but it's difficult for me when you use that tone.",
        "Angela: Phyllis. These are spoooons. Spoons have rounded tops, and are used to scoop things. What we need are forks, which have prongs, or tiny spears on top. And we need knives, which have blades. Do you understand me now?",
        "Phyllis: Yes.",
        "Angela: Goodie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Dwight: Damnit Kelly! It knows! It knows what you did!",
        "Darryl: Who knows?",
        "Dwight: Return it! Return it now!",
        "Darryl: Hey! How about instead of yelling at our sweet little Miss Kapoor over five hundred sheets of paper you get back to your desk. Start sellin' multiple reams like a man.",
        "Dwight: Y... You don't understand. If... okay, if this makes the difference, I'm gonna tell it that you were responsible.",
        "Darryl: Who's it?",
        "Darryl: Here you go.",
        "Kelly: Thanks.",
        "Darryl: So you still missing Ryan?",
        "Kelly: Not so much anymore.",
        "Darryl: Mmmmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: I am not a bad person. When I left Staples, I took some of their leads with me but I never intended to use them. What did I intend to do with them? Who knows? Maybe keep them as a souvenir. Maybe use them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: Yes, Mr. Galliado. How would you like to pay ten percent less for paper than you're paying right now? It's not important how I got your information. What is important is that you say yes. Good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Alright. I'm ready to go and I'm callin' shotgun.",

[singing] I'm leavin' inside Jim's car, I don't know when I'll be back again. Yes I do. Tomorrow I'll be back. I'll be back. Tomorrow. Um... yeah. So you know what? Why don't you guys take off a little bit early tonight?",
        "Angela: Because there's a party! A party for the website I've been planning for two weeks.",
        "Michael: If you are not this tall, you may not ride the rollercoaster. See you guys tomorrow.",
        "Dwight: Perfect. So let me just get some basic information from you. Mmmhmm.",
        "DunMiff/sys: [on monitor] Oh. I didn't realize we could use the leads we stole from Staples.",
        "Dwight: I'm sorry. Am, so sorry. I... yes. Uh, could you repeat that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: Yesss! Ten reams for the US District Court! Did I happen to mention the forty reams for the battered women's shelter?",
        "Andy: No ! [blows air horn and dances]",
        "Dwight: Huh?!",
        "Angela: Stop it! Gimme that! Give it!",
        "Dwight: Did you see the board?",
        "Angela: There's still an hour.",

        "Jim: Yep. A long time ago, but, I liked it.",
        "Michael: Got it for Ryan. Wanted to get him Oh The Places You'll Go, but they were sold out. Figured...",
        "Jim: Yeah.",
        "Michael: Same sort of stuff in here.",
        "Jim: It's not. It's different. But it's a good book.",
        "Michael: Mmwa. Mmwa.",
        "Jim: What was that?",
        "Michael: Leaving Pennsylvania.",
        "Jim: Oh. Two kisses.",
        "Michael: One for me one for Jan.",
        "Jim: Gotcha.",
        "Michael: You guys should come over for dinner. You and Pam. That'd be fun. Friday?",
        "Jim: That would be fun.",
        "Michael: Wanna come over Friday?",
        "Jim: Uhhh. Can't.",
        "Michael: After work you guys...",
        "Jim: Oh, no cause... you're gonna let me know when we're close, right?",
        "Michael: Yes. Actually I will tell you right now. It's a club called Chatroom, and there's a password to get in, which is actually password. So...",
        "Jim: Mmmkay...",
        "Michael: What are you doing?",

        "Michael: Yes.",
        "Jim: Yep.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Well the invitation says VIP's only. Is this how you treat your VIP's, Ryan? We're already in the city. The main part with the buildings. What am I supposed to do? What do you want me to do tonight? And if you tell me, that I have to drive back to Scranton, to the satellite party, I am going to throw up! Okay I'm going to throw up. I'm throwing up. You're making me throw up, Ryan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: You know what this is like? I'll tell you what this is like. This is like when the Freshmen would throw a party and wouldn't let any of the Seniors go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Doesn't it just piss you off sometimes that that little twerp got the promotion over us?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Angela: How do you tell someone it's over? You send them a notarized letter, right? Well, what if the recipient is your notary?",

        "Angela: Thank you.",
        "Michael: Nope nope nope no. This is going to be nothing like the party you've been planning. This is going to be good and everybody's gonna come. What's wrong with Dwight?",

        "Michael: This was a pretty disappointing day. It was kind of a slap in the face to realize that I wasn't as important as I thought I was to a certain young executive who I cared about. But, you know, I'm not gonna cry over it. I did that in the car on the way home.",

        "Michael: Yes you can.",

        "Andy: Hello.",

So now I've got to pull together a whole new party, and my useless number two quit, so now there's no one in charge of orchids, chocolates, or the thing that's made of ice. And my upper back itches, and it's itched all day, and I can't reach it, and Kevin had Greek food for lunch again.",

        "Pizza guy: The half off coupon only applies to orders of two pizzas.",

        "Oscar: It's not pizza.",

        "Pizza guy: Not my problem.",
        "Michael: It is your problem. That's no way to do business, okay? I ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so I would like eight pizzas for half-off. End of story.",
        "Pizza guy: Great story. It's sixty-three fifty, and that's not including tip.",
        "Michael: I'm not giving that to you.",

        "Michael: No, no you're not going anywhere. You're staying here until we figure this out.",
        "Pizza guy: What?",
        "Michael: You know what? This young man needs to learn that's not how you treat people. I don't care if it's pizza. Good business is about respect and accountability and follow through. You don't just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody, do you? Dwight, please escort this young man into the conference room. Right now, get in the conference room.",
        "Pizza guy: I'm not going in there.",

        "Pizza guy: You better think about what you're doing.",
        "Michael: No! I'm an adult, I don't have to think or do anything. You're a kid, a little snot-nosed, punk kid who thinks he's better than everyone else, because he's some hot shot, and you don't know anything about sales. So stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay?",
        "Pizza guy: Sales?",
