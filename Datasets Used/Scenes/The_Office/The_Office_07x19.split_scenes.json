        "Pam: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Dunder Mifflin is having our first own garage sale. Like many Americans, we realized we had a lot of things that we really didn't need. And 10 cents of every dollar is going into the party fund so we can throw parties for ourselves.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: People! Look alive. It's showtime. Doors open in 3...2...1.",
        "Jim: Oh, yikes.",
        "Pam: It's cold Dwight. Just shut the door and let people come in the front.",
        "Dwight: It's good that its cold it will drive business inside.",
        "Pam: The signs will drive people inside.",

        "Michael: You know it's really more for a bachelor pad. I just want to get a fair price.",
        "Holly: Well we could put it in storage... in case.",

        "Michael: I had a great idea until you ruined it.",
        "Oscar: Wanna know how to do it? Here's how you do it. Take her out to dinner. Go down on one knee. If you are in costume, you did something wrong. If at any point you find yourself tying a ring to a dogs collar, stop, and look at yourself.",

        "Andy: And call a proxy meeting to take control of you and oil once and for all.",
        "Kevin: No you cant do that. You cant play a black mail card and call a proxy meeting in the same turn.",

        "Michael: How about this I throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof, it hits the ground, the head pops off, this leads me to the line ' I lost my head when I fell in love with you.'",
        "Jim: That's a guarantee.",
        "Michael: It's easy enough to get a corpse, you just go to a med school. I already have the ring.",
        "Jim: Don't think you need the corpse then.",

        "Michael: Is she not going to like that?",
        "Pam: No she's going to love it so I think you can keep the proposal simple. You know like when Jim proposed. He just he got down on one knee and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him and it was perfect.",
        "Oscar: Where was that.",
        "Jim: At a gas station. [oscar laughs]",

        "Michael: I know but I'm still scared I don't know why.",
        "Jim: Cause it's a big deal. I mean.. I knew Pam was gonna say yes but I was still scared.",
        "Pam: You were scared?",
        "Jim: Yeah... it.s scary.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Get this... Kevin thought I was gonna sell my Bowflex for 200 dollars and I told him 'Dude this was a prop in my movie.'",
        "Holly: Look I need to talk to you.",
        "Michael: Ok it's because we haven't sold anything. You know what? We just wait until the end of the day, people get desperate, and they're gonna pay anything.",
        "Holly: I think I need to go home to Colorado. My dad isn't doing so well.",

        "Michael: Ok.",
        "Holly: And I was thinking... you know maybe since given our last conversation that we're both ready... Michael Scott will you..",
        "Michael: No, no, shhhhut it. Mhmm. Oh God. Nope, nope, nope.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: No. I am not going to be proposed to in the break room. That is not going to be our story. Mhm hm. Should have burned this place down when I had the chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Hey guys it's my turn.",
        "Andy: You cant go, you're dead, I shot you 5 moves ago.",
        "Kevin: Yeah I told you, you can't shoot people.",
        "Darryl: I told you we're way past rules. We have been for some time now. We start having rules now, everything we built collapses.",
        "Kevin: This is stupid and I want my money back. Where's the money?",
        "Darryl: Yeah where is it?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: I started with a thumb tack and traded my way to a telescope. But in a way the most valuable thing here wasn't the telescope at all. No, it was this... packet of beans. So I traded the telescope for it. And I can just go buy another telescope.",
