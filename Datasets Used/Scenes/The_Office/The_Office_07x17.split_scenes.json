        "Helene: You're lucky to be alive.",
        "Michael: It'll take a lot more than a bullet to the brain, lungs, heart, back, and balls to kill Michael Scarn.",

        "Michael: For the insurance money! I knew it all along! [the President, Goldenface, and his minion pull out automatic machine guns] You will never get away with this! [takes a painting of Abraham Lincoln and awkwardly smashes it on the President's head, runs out of the office as Goldenface and his minion shoot at them]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Where had I gone wrong? All I wanted was to start a family with my beautiful wife. But somewhere along the way, things got messed up.",

        "Billy: You got problems?! My TV don't work! I pay thirty bucks a month for the damn satellite what's-a-whosit, I can't even get the damn game! Now you tell me, what's worse than that?",
        "Michael: [laughs to himself] Don't ever change Billy. Goldenface is going to blow up the NHL All Star Game tomorrow.",
        "Billy: I see what you mean about problems. I know what'll cheer you up. That table of bachelorettes over there bought you this drink. [a table with Meredith, Phyllis, Karen, and Angela all say hey to Michael]",
        "Karen: Ever banged an entire bachelorette party, baby? [winks]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Karen: Why are you singling my line out, like, a million years later?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: I'm too depressed to save the big game Billy.",
        "Billy: I'm gonna cheer you up, the only ways I know hows. [to a small boy in overalls] Hey kid! Hit G-9 on the Jukebox!",
        "Michael: No Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died.",
        "Billy: There is a whole crowd of people out there, who need to learn, how to do The Scarn.",
        "Michael: [A funky beat sounds from the Jukebox and Michael starts dancing poorly] Well my name's Michael Scarn and I'm here to say, I'm about to do The Scarn in a major way. [the bachelorettes and the others in the bar stand up to join him] You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that's how you do The Scarn! [doing the actions he says to] You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that's how you do The Scarn! You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that's how you do The Scarn!",
        "Todd Packer: [as a drunken man in the bar] If doing The Scarn is gay, then I'm the biggest queer on Earth!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: [cracking up at the stupidity of it, the rest of the office besides Michael and Holly are concealing their laughter. Pam Is trying to quiet Jim up] Sorry.",
        "Michael: [turns off the movie from the remote, the office complains]",
        "Jim: I'm sorry, I'm really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved, to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back.",
        "Kelly: Yeah Michael the movie is amazing!",
        "Kevin: It's like one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life.",
        "Ryan: You should enter it in festivals!",
        "Kevin: Or carnivals!",
        "Michael: [to Holly] Well that's a... pretty good reaction. [Holly nods] Pretty cool, right? Did you like it? Did you like that?",
        "Holly: Uh... which part?",
        "Michael: Okay. [Stands up and leaves the conference room to the dismay of the office] No, it's not good enough. It's not good enough...",
        "Andy: Some people are really popping on screen!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Hey.",
        "Holly: Hey! Good movie.",
        "Michael: Mmmm, good? Everybody out there says it's great!",
        "Holly: I loved it.",
        "Michael: Did you? What did you love about it?",
        "Holly: Uhm, I loved that you got to work together with all your friends. Isn't that great when you can all work together like that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: No, no. Holly, this isn't Ocean's Eleven, where you get together with all your friends and just have fun and don't care about how it turns out. What'd you really think, honestly.",
        "Holly: Uhm...",
        "Michael: Is it, is it because you're afraid of where this is gonna take me? See, because I need you... to keep me grounded.",
        "Holly: Not worried about that.",
        "Michael: [angrily] It was eleven years, okay? This has been my dream for eleven years, and if you don't think it's great than you're basically saying that you don't believe in my dream.",
        "Holly: Wha- It's your dream and you never even mentioned it before!",
        "Michael: I talk about a lot of things, Holly! I was eventually gonna get around to my dream! Obviously! Eleven years I could've been working on the Scarn Nebulus.",
        "Holly: Well why do you have to make a movie at all?",
        "Michael: Because, if I don't have this, what do I have? I have nothing.",
        "Holly: Really, you can't think of anything else that you might have?",
        "Michael: I have my book on business, Somehow I Manage. I have my HBO comedy special, Here I Go Again dot-dot-dot. But you know what? When I think about it, when I really think about it, none of those things are as real to me as my movie.",
        "Holly: I'm real.",
        "Michael: Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass. And I'm gonna go watch the movie with people who think it's great! And I'm sorry I called you a pain in the ass, I'm angry, and I love you.",
        "Holly: I love you too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: I am a huge Woody Allen fan. Although I've only seen Antz, but I'll tell you something. What I respect about that man, is that when he was going through all that stuff that came out in the press, about how Antz was just a rip-off of A Bug's Life, he stayed true to his films. Or at least the film that I saw which again was Antz. The thing is... I thought Bug's Life was better, much better. Than Ants. The point is, don't listen to your critics, listen to your fans.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Who likes Threat Level[/b]: Midnight? [applause from the office] Okay then who wants to watch the rest?! [everyone yells approval]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Samuel: Michael! You have to get to that puck before halftime! Or the whole stadium will explode!",
        "Michael: I know, it's a good thing my trainer and mentor is here to cheer me on!",
        "Samuel: Cherokee Jack? Michael he died.",
        "Michael: [crying] This one's for you Cherokee Jack. [Michael skates into the rink of an already in-play match]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: We filmed this during an actual Scranton High School Hockey Game, trying to qualify for states.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: [he office shushes Michael to hear the movie better] That's fine, it's great!",
        "Michael: No, no! Actually it's really screwed up because they [chuckles], they were trying to qualify, they were disqualified, they had to forfeit the game. Undefeated season. That's why there were so many people there. [Michael stands up, clearly realizing that his movie is not as great as he thought]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Why is your face gold?",
        "Goldenface: Why do you care?",
        "Pam: I'm just making conversation.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Samuel: Yah! [kicks open the gate to save the hostages, hostages rejoice as Samuel unties them] [the puck is seen flying into space and it hits a satellite, Billy is at his bar and his TV suddenly turns back on]",
