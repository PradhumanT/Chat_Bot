        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: I have doubts about this too. But when one person freaks out, sometimes it weirdly makes the other one calmer. That's one thing I've learned about relationships. I hate that I just used the word relationship. [Michael comes out in a suit] Hey! You look great! [checks something off her list] Let's go!",

        "Andy: Cool!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: I've never been a kiss up. I - it's just not how I operate. I mean, I've always subscribed to the idea that if you really want to impress your boss, you go in there and you do mediocre work. Half-heartedly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Next on the list - open the mail.",
        "Michael: Oh. Wow. \"Michael Scott Paper Company.\" Okay. Very official. \"Dear Mr. Scott. Please be advised that it is in violation of your condominium agreement to conduct a business headquartered in your residence. The penalty, a forfeiture of residence.\"",

        "Charles: Oh yeah?",
        "Stanley: From Argentina.",
        "Charles: I didn't know we had so many, uh, soccer fans in the office.",
        "Andy: I mean, to be fair, I was the first one to talk about it, but...",
        "Charles: What about you, Jim? You a fan of the game?",
        "Jim: Uh, no. Nope. Not really.",
        "Charles: Well, it's not for everybody I suppose. [Andy laughs]",
        "Jim: It's 'cause I'm more of a player.",
        "Charles: Yeah?",
        "Jim: You bet.",
        "Dwight: Really, Jim? I had no idea you played soccer. 'Cause you never, ever talk about it.",
        "Jim: Well I do.",

        "Dwight: You can be so modest sometimes.",
        "Jim: Well, maybe you should get back to work.",
        "Dwight: Maybe you and Charles should kick the soccer ball around.",
        "Jim: Maybe we will someday.",
        "Dwight: Maybe you will tonight after work. What do you say?",
        "Charles: That's a great idea, Dwight.",
        "Dwight: Great ideas are just part of what I bring to the table.",
        "Jim: Yeah.",
        "Dwight: I don't try and be anything that I'm not.",
        "Charles: What do you say, Jim? Huh? Wanna play some soccer?",
        "Dwight: Jim, what do you say?",
        "Angela: Sounds fun.",
        "Andy: I'm in it to win.",

        "Pam: We have a meeting with an investor today.",
        "Michael: Yes we do. So, get excited. But I have to go the bathroom real quick. If you'll excuse me, be right back. [gets out of the car] Ah, okay.",
        "Vikram: He seems really confident.",
        "Pam: He can be.",
        "Vikram: Confidence. It's the food of the wise man but the liquor of the fool.",
        "Pam: Hm. I'm looking forward to getting to know you better, Vikram.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Hey. I would like a pair of size nine, please. [Ryan is working at the bowling alley] It's Michael.",

        "Michael: It is.",
        "Pam: [looks at list] When did you add this to the list?",
        "Michael: Pam. Everyone deserves a second second chance. [walks back to Ryan] Ryan, just out of curiosity, how much do you get paid here?",
        "Ryan: Sixty thousand dollars a year.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Well I'm sure that you must all have very, very busy schedules, so I appreciate you meeting with us here today. What this is is a business that I have worked toward my entire life. Hey! [snaps in front of sleeping old man] I have assembled what I believe to be the most exciting, sought-after talent in the industry today. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the dream team. From our very own Scranton, Pennsylvania - Pam Beesly. Pretty Pam is always reaching for the stars and someday, she may just surprise us all and grab one. Meet Vikram. From his humble beginnings as a - stay standing - from his humble beginnings as a prominent surgeon, he risked it all to become the most successful telemarketer in the lipophedrene industry. And do not call it a comeback. The youngest vice president in the history of Dunder Mifflin, and recent bowling alley employee, Ryan Howard is about to make a splash in paper.",
        "Nana: So let's hear it.",
        "Michael: Okay. I have spent the last 15 years learning the ins and outs of the paper industry. With a lean, mean fighting crew and low overhead, I think I can perform the same business at a much, much higher rate of profit.",
        "Nana: How do you expect to turn a profit in this economy?",
        "Michael: By wanting it more. By working hard-",
        "Nana: What's your mission statement?",

        "Jim: Kickoff. [to camera] My strategy is to touch the ball as little as possible. Chalk it up to teamwork. [to team] Alright! [clapping]",

        "Nana: Michael, I don't know about this.",
        "Michael: Nana. [softly] I really think that Papa would want you to do this.",
        "Nana: I'm not so sure.",
        "Michael: Well what is it exactly? I mean, what, what specifically? We don't - it doesn't have to be paper. We could sell medicine and other...",
        "Nana: See, this is what concerns me.",
        "Old Woman: We could just give him a chance. It's not much money.",
        "Michael: Well... this might not be the right time, but I need more than I originally asked for.",
        "Nana: This isn't a handout club. It's an investment club!",

        "Charles: Why'd you duck, Jim?",
        "Jim: What?",
        "Dwight: Yeah, Jim. Why would an experienced soccer player like yourself duck at the very last moment?",
        "Jim: Okay, I'm just gonna go get some ice.",

        "Michael: Yeah. I have cable and satellite as a backup. [to Pam] Yeah, I know. Two not-so-great things in a row. Ehhhh, well. Stuff happens, right? At least we got Ryan. The Rye-guy. We should call him Rye bread. We don't have to call him that. Unless you like it. We could call him that.",
        "Pam: I can't do this.",
        "Michael: What's that?",
        "Pam: I can't do this. I had a real job. I sat ten feet away from my fiance. I had health benefits. I was just feeling impulsive. I should have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle.",
        "Michael: Blech.",
        "Pam: I just keep getting bored. And I let things build up and build up and then I - I, I do something too big, like this. Who does this?",
        "Michael: Well you know what? My mom always used to say that average people are the most special people in the world. And that's why God made so many.",
        "Pam: We don't have any money. We don't have an office. We don't have anything.",

Pam, I do my best work when people don't believe in me. I remember in high school, my math teacher told me I was gonna flunk out. And know what I did? The very next day I went out and I scored more goals than anyone else in the history of the hockey team. See what I mean? I thrive on this. I thrive on it. So I'm gonna go inside. I'm going to make some calls, I'm gonna get us an office space, and I'm going to show you why you joined this company. Okay? [Pam nods]",

If I were you, Charles Miner, I would watch your step. Because the Michael Scott Paper Company is about to open a big ol' can of whoopass on Dunder Mifflin. [Pam and Michael stare him down, he walks away] Actually a six pack. We're gonna open a six pack of whoopass. He looks scared."
