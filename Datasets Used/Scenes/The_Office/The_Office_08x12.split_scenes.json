        "Dwight: Oh, ugh. [stands and looks at meatball in chair] What is this, a meatball? Really? [Stanley laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: It's always more fun to mess with Dwight with an audience. That was usually Pam so now that she's out I had to find someone else. Turns out that Stanley is quite the comedy fan. But not everything makes him laugh. He has very specific tastes. Through a painstaking process of trial and error, I've found out what he likes. And it's really weird.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: Jim, come on! That's so juvenile! What the- [opens drawer full of meatballs]",
        "Stanley: You've been meatballed! [laughs]",
        "Dwight: Ugh.",
        "Stanley: Are you ready for some meatball?",
        "Dwight: Aw, man. [Stanley laughs] This is not very clever, Jim.",
        "Jim: I know.",
        "Stanley: Look for your stapler!",
        "Dwight: [Dwight finds stapler in giant meatball] Really Jim? Really? Very funny.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stanley: [to Phyllis] Oh okay. Good night. [climbs in to Dwight's car] What's the haul?",
        "Dwight: Thirty-two meatballs.",
        "Stanley: Good day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: That idiot's been feeding us for a week.",
        "Stanley: We'll never have to buy meatballs again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Erin: [phone rings] Dunder Mifflin. Jessica, hi! How are you? Oh yay, that's so great to hear.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Erin: I'm not going to be one of those exes who can't move on. They have their life and I have mine. I'm taking an Italian class. So far I've learned tortellini, spagettini, linguini... Well it's not so much a class as a restaurant, but I do Monday, Wednesday, Friday from seven to nine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Erin: I will patch you through right now. You sound really pretty today. Okay.",
        "Andy: Jessica! I love you! That's a message from my mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: My parents met Jessica and they completely flipped for her so they gave me this old family ring to use on her. I know, whoa! Pump the breaks, Bernard, too early! I get it. I just, you know, I'm just carrying it around, seeing how it feels. I haven't proposed to anyone in years... Mom took the main diamond out, she thought that had more of a my little brother kind of vibe to it, but...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: [Robert is looking at pictures of a house online] Whoa, looks pretty nice. Got a little bit of a Shining vibe, though.",
        "Oscar: Oh, who needs a house that size?",
        "Dwight: Big. Stupid. Pure chump bait.",
        "Robert: I'm selling the house, actually.",
        "Jim: You know, there's a glare from over here... oh wow, that's magnificent.",
        "Robert: It's mid-recession in a depressed area of a faltering state and I've got the most expensive house on the market. The one percent are suffering too, people. I wanted it to be my Playboy mansion. A temple to wine, revelry, s*x, intrigue... this was hot on the heels of Eyes Wide Shut, mind you. Then I met my wife, she moved in, made it her own. Now she's left me and forced me to sell the place. The ultimate insult? They're calling my speakeasy lounge a rumpus room. [Jim laughs] Does my turmoil amuse you, Jim?",
        "Jim: I'm sorry, I thought you were making a joke.",
        "Robert: What could you possibly have found funny in what I said? What was the joke you thought you heard?",
        "Jim: I guess I thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. Kind of laughing at your own pain, sad clown thing.",
        "Robert: Oh yes. How hilarious it is to laugh at clowns, the painted jesters of the dying circus industry. Very funny, Jim. I get it.",
        "Andy: Um, I'm getting reports of a serious outbreak of the grumpies in here.",
        "Robert: A beautiful monster cost me my forties and my dream home. I think I'm entitled to the occasional bad day.",
        "Andy: Well, please tell Susan we all say hi.",
        "Kevin: Dude, what if, since you're feeling grumpy, we all swing by tonight and check out your indoor pool? [Robert laughs]",
        "Oscar: Kevin, no.",
        "Robert: What, as some sort of last hoorah?",
        "Kevin: Yeah. All of us in the pool, saying hoorah. Maybe the last one that says hoorah is it.",
        "Robert: You know I suppose someone should enjoy the place before I hand it over to the staging experts at Remax tomorrow. Let's try this: everyone, tonight, my house, wear a swimsuit. Let's just call it a get-together. And let's say no food.",
        "Kevin: Hey Oscar, was that you who just created a party out of thin air or was it me?",
        "Oscar: That was you, Kevin.",
        "Kevin: It was me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meredith: You going tonight, kiddo? Cause I can give you a lift.",
        "Erin: Oh, I don't know, Meredith. It seems like you shouldn't drive maybe ever.",
        "Meredith: It's no problem. You live right near me.",
        "Erin: How do you know where I live?",
        "Meredith: Andy followed you home after the Christmas party.",
        "Erin: Why?",
        "Meredith: He wanted to make sure California didn't put it in you.",
        "Erin: Oh. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Erin: Wow. Andy's such a weird stalker. Following me home like that when he has a girlfriend? I should get a restraining order. [squeaks]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Angela: [sticks a hand in the pool] Oh, it is warm.",
        "Cathy: It's almost too warm.",
        "Gabe: I'm feeling eighty-two, eighty-two and a half.",
        "Ryan: Oh, so close. Eighty-one.",
        "Gabe: [to Cathy] Well, we'll say its eight-two and it'll be our secret.",
        "Cathy: [to Jim] Hey, late guy.",
        "Jim: Hey. Wow. Just stopping by. Got another party to go to. A wife and two kids at home party.",
        "Andy: Oh.",
        "Jim: DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some serious Radio Disney tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: You're looking at the master of leaving parties early. They key is, you have to make a strong impression, so you want to have a picture taken, you want to say some peculiar non sequitur that people remember, you want to note something unique, a talking point, for later. I don't mean to brag, but New Year's Eve, I was home by nine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: Robert, just wanted to grab you one second. This place is amazing, by the way.",
        "Robert: You should see the whole thing.",
        "Jim: I bet I should. [takes cell phone photo] That's beautiful, I'm going to email that to you.",
        "Robert: I'm just about to give the tour.",
        "Jim: All right-",
        "Robert: Join us. You must see what you were laughing about.",
        "Jim: I must...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: [looks at pool] Wow.",
        "Andy: [hides ring] Yeah, it's pretty serious poolage.",
        "Jessica: [sees Andy's hand in his pocket] What are you doing?",
        "Andy: Hmm? Flicking a bug off my wiener. [they both laugh]",
        "Jessica: Gross. I'm getting a drink. Do you want anything?",
        "Andy: No, I'm good.",
        "Erin: [runs to Andy] Funny how we can be surrounded by people and still feel so lonely. Hi.",
        "Andy: Hi.",
        "Erin: How is everything? How's your car?",
        "Andy: It's great. You know. Reliable. Great mileage.",
        "Erin: Is that so? How about this weekend we take that sucker to a duck pond or something? Maybe get caught in the rain?",
        "Andy: Well, I can't. I'm going skiing with Jessica. you know, a couple of dopes on the slopes.",
        "Erin: Oh, like a goodbye trip.",
        "Andy: No. What?",
        "Jessica: Hey.",
        "Erin: Hi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Erin: I guess Andy isn't totally over his current girlfriend. But, if he was jealous once before then maybe I can make him jealous again. Just not with Robert. He told me he was a ride I wouldn't survive, and I believe him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Darryl: Val. You made it.",
        "Val: Yup, yup.",
        "Darryl: Uh oh, look at this. Red plastic cup, red plastic cup. How about that?",
        "Val: You know, you are just as dumb at night.",
        "Darryl: Mmm. [they clink cups]",
        "Andy: All right, theres- this would be no problem. I could swim under, one breath.",
        "Jessica: No, show me.",
        "Andy: Okay.",
        "Jessica: Dive in right here.",
        "Andy: In a minute. In a minute.",
        "Jessica: Okay. You don't know what you're doing.",
        "Andy: A minute would be cool.",
        "Erin: Hey, Dwight Snoot.",
        "Dwight: What-",
        "Erin: What you doing?",
        "Dwight: I'm relaxing. Scram. [pushes her]",
        "Erin: Ow.",
        "Andy: Hey, Stanley. Um, what happened to my pants?",
        "Stanley: I moved them. Pants only need a chair if there's a person in them.",
        "Andy: Where... [finds pants, looks for ring]",
        "Erin: Come on, don't you want to play?",
        "Dwight: Oh really?",
        "Erin: Yeah.",
        "Dwight: Yeah, you want to play you little hick? [kicks her in to the pool, Erin screams]",
        "Kevin: Whoa.",
        "Angela: Dwight! Oh my gosh! Dwight!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Robert: Here we have the parlor. I imagined people would set down their coats and symbolically their inhibitions. This was the gateway. You enter this room a lawyer, a doctor, a teacher, a judge, but beyond it you're simply a pen1s, a v*g1n*, hunger, ache. Susan used it as a Pilates studio.",
        "Oscar: [sees wine collection] Holy cow!",
        "Robert: Wine collection.",
        "Oscar: How many bottles? Three hundred?",
        "Robert: [laughs] About twelve hundred. What the hell, grab a bottle. Less inventory for the lawyers.",
        "Oscar: Toby! Chateau Margaux ninety-five. You know your wine.",
        "Toby: Well, and you have a... yes, a- d- another chateau.",
        "Ryan: Robert, you are too kind.",
        "Robert: Oh.",
        "Gabe: Too kind doesn't begin to cover it.",
        "Ryan: With ammunition like this we are in for quite a night, you and me.",
        "Gabe: And Gabe-y makes three.",
        "Jim: Robert, thank you. Thank you for this. Thank you for all this. This night's been magical.",
        "Robert: Jim, come see this next room. I think you especially would like it.",
        "Jim: Really? Why?",
        "Robert: I don't know. Maybe not. Just come.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Erin: [Dwight dunks her] Oh!",
        "Dwight: [laughs] You regret attacking me now, hick? Huh?",
        "Erin: Stop it. Dwight, I was flirting with you. I was trying to use you to make Andy jealous.",
        "Dwight: I'm not going to help you. Why would you choose me? Because I'm mighty? Because I'm the manliest man in the office? I'll do it. [he picks her up]",
        "Erin: [giggles] Oh Dwight!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Erin: [giggles] Stop.",
        "Dwight: You stop.",
        "Erin: No, you stop.",
        "Dwight: No, you stop.",
        "Erin: [to camera] Is he looking? [shakes her head] Oh. You can stop.",
        "Dwight: Okay, you can stop.",
        "Erin: No, no, no, he's not looking.",
        "Dwight: No, you can stop.",
        "Erin: You can actually stop.",
        "Kelly: Whoa, you guys, I just found this insane engagement ring. Is anyone missing this?",
        "Meredith: The main stone's missing.",
        "Kelly: I don't know. It looks pretty great to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Robert: I pictured myself here every night eating a leg of mutton, the juices dripping down my bare chest, wiping my fingers on the walls. Then I met the vegan.",
        "Jim: Good night.",
        "Oscar: [raises wine bottle] To the kitchen!",
        "All: To the kitchen!",
        "Robert: To the kitchen. Onward!",
        "Oscar: Toby, what's compelling about this is the note of persimmon. Right?",
        "Toby: Note? It's a symphony.",
        "Oscar: Okay, you have to join my wine-tasting club.",
        "Toby: I would love that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Toby: Toby, you are playing a dangerous game. Guess I'm through the gateway now, though, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Darryl: [to Val] You know, I don't think I've ever been in this exact angle before. I was scared at first, but I like it.",
        "Meredith: You guys got to try this pool. No top scum, no band-aids. This thing is choice.",
        "Val: You in?",
        "Darryl: Yeah, sure, sure. I'll be right in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Darryl: I've been working out. But, the problem is, I've been building muscle underneath. And that top layer hasn't burned off yet. Awkward stage.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: [he and Erin feed each other chips] Ah, mmm. So good. Now take a chip, crush it into my face, really rub the grease around. Do it. Now rub it in. Oh, yeah, that's so good. Ah...",
        "Erin: Andy's not even looking. I think sexy eating is a dead end.",
        "Dwight: Damn it.",
        "Erin: What is the most romantic possible thing?",
        "Dwight: We can get some chicken fights going in the pool.",
        "Erin: Dwight, that's just- that's really perfect. Thank you.",
        "Both: Yes! [they high five and jump in the pool]",
        "Angela: You're in my way!",
        "Erin: Andy, Dwight and I challenge you and Jess to a chicken fight. Winner take all.",
        "Dwight: Chicken fight!",
        "Andy: No thanks.",
        "Erin: Dang it! What the heck already?",
        "Dwight: Hey, Cathy. Chicken fight!",
        "Cathy: Okay, yeah. Who's going to be my partner? Where's Jim?",
        "Kevin: I'm right here! [gets in pool] Cold. Cold. Come on, Cath.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: Yeah- oh!",
        "Erin: [knocks Cathy off Kevin's shoulders] Yes! Woo!",
        "Dwight: Woohoo! Yes!",
        "Erin: Dwight, our chemistry is really clicking. We work so well together.",
        "Dwight: I know. I could just bang you right now.",
        "Erin: He's not looking. [Dwight dumps her in the pool] Hey!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Robert: I had two bears sewn together to make this king-size. Total waste of two bears.",
        "Jim: To both these bears.",
        "Ryan: To both these bears.",
        "Toby: Bears.",
        "Oscar: To both these bears.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Robert: When I put in the screening room, I bought three movies: Caligula, Last Tango in Paris, and Emmanuelle 2. Last two movies I actually watched in here Marley and Me and On Golden [bleep] Pond.",
        "Ryan: I mean, it's clearly meant for watching erotic cinema.",
        "Gabe: Yup. We could watch some right now if you want. I got a Korean film on my iPod if you want to just- if you have the cables.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: Kelly, that's a crazy ring you found.",
        "Kelly: Yeah, thanks. I'm really glad I found it.",
        "Andy: I can't believe you're wearing it. Are you not superstitious at all?",
        "Kelly: Shh. Of course I'm superstitious. What are you talking about?",
        "Andy: The ring of a failed marriage might have some sinister energy, right? Am I just being silly?",
        "Phyllis: Oh, I don't think you're being silly.",
        "Kelly: Oh God. [takes off ring]",
        "Andy: You know what, I can just sell it and put the money in the party fund.",
        "Phyllis: [snatches ring] Then another woman will get it. We can't allow that. We have to destroy it.",
        "Jessica: [to Andy] Come on. Let's chicken fight those two.",
        "Val: [comes up from under water] How was that?",
        "Kevin: Okay. Watch my toes. [does hand stand]",
        "Darryl: Hey Val. Want a beer? It might taste better than that pool water you've been drinking.",
        "Val: No, I'm good. Thank you.",
        "Darryl: Cool.",
        "Val: Cool. [to Kevin] Does Darryl not swim?",
        "Kevin: That's racist! I don't know. But I would say, by looking at him, no, Darryl does not swim.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: [knocks Erin off Dwight's shoulders] Yes!",
        "Andy: Yeah!",
        "Dwight: [to Erin] Maybe we should take a little break.",
        "Erin: Dwight, we've got this. I promise. I will not leave your shoulders, no matter what.",
        "Dwight: Okay.",
        "Erin: One more?",
        "Andy: Yeah!",
        "Jessica: Yeah! Great! [others cheer and clap]",
        "Erin: Mush, mush, mush! Come on!",
        "Dwight: Go!",
        "Erin: Go! Okay. Yeah.",
        "Jessica: Here we go! [knocks Erin over] Yes!",
        "Andy: Yay! [Erin comes back up] Whoa!",
        "Kevin: Wow!",
        "Andy: I cannot believe you're still up!",
        "Jessica: I cannot believe it either.",
        "Erin: I've got this! [Dwight gasps] Charge! Go! Go! [Dwight sinks]",
        "Andy: [muffled] Dwight are you okay? Hey, damn it-",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: [coughs up water] Erin, did we win?",
        "Erin: Sure. Sure we did.",
        "Dwight: You're lying. We didn't win.",
        "Erin: Hey, hey, hey Dwight. It's okay. Just rest. Just rest.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: You've broken up your last couple, you evil ring. Do it. [Meredith sets fire to paper ring boat]",
        "Angela: We're in the pool!",
        "Meredith: Shut it, Angela.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: Ugh. Same old party, same old people. Am I right? Reminds me of Phyllis's birthday.",
        "Andy: Ooh, do not remind me of Phyllis's birthday.",
        "Dwight: I know. [laughs] But boy, that Erin. She sure is a ripe little tiger, isn't she? Rroww! And to think, I always thought of her as a second Meredith. Respectfully, I don't want us walking into a similar Angela kind of situation.",
        "Andy: Mmm.",
        "Dwight: So I just want to make sure that you are completely, one hundred percent done with Erin.",
        "Andy: Last I checked, I'm with Jessica. And I like to get my monog on. It's monogamy for my hog 'n me.",
        "Dwight: Not what I asked.",
        "Andy: We're done. Erin and I are over.",
        "Dwight: So then you won't mind if tonight I just go crazy on her, just go nuts, rrargh. With s*x.",
        "Andy: Have at it. Or take it slow. Whatever you guys work out.",
        "Dwight: [sighs] You're an idiot.",
        "Kevin: Kelly, that is mine! This is mine! [Val, Erin and Kevin play with pool noodles]",
        "Erin: Uh-uh. Uh-uh.",
        "Kevin: No!",
        "Val: Oh I've got him!",
        "Darryl: Cannonball! [jumps in pool] Let's do this!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: [Erin swims up with ring] Wow.",
        "Erin: So I kind of stepped on this. I think it's yours.",
        "Andy: Yeah. Oh wow. How did you know it was mine?",
        "Erin: The Bernard family seal. Duh.",
        "Andy: Duh.",
        "Erin: Sorry if your special night was ruined.",
        "Andy: Oh, whoa. Whoa, no, it's not a special night.",
        "Erin: Oh, you weren't going to do that?",
        "Andy: Honestly Erin, I don't know what I'm doing. I... I just... I don't know. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Erin: Andy's confused. That's not what I was hoping for, but it's not so bad either. I can live with confused. I get confused. I totally get confused.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Robert: And of course, the pool. The ultimate lubricant for any wild evening. It was here that my parties would have crescendoed into true madness.",
        "Jim: To madness.",
        "Ryan: To madness.",
        "Toby: To madness. [Robert laughs]",
        "Meredith: To madness.",
        "Jim: Hey, um, I think you parked my car in. Is there any way you can move your van?",
        "Meredith: Oh, I'm sorry. When I got here, I put my keys in a bowl.",
        "Jim: Are you serious?",
        "Ryan: Robert, I want you to know, I'm here to rock with you as late as you want, man.",
        "Gabe: And that goes double for me. I'll stay even later than you'd like.",
        "Oscar: [Toby pours wine into Oscar's mouth] Toby! I am Bacchus, god of wine!",
        "Toby: And I am Bacchus's friend!",
        "Robert: Gentlemen, bear witness. While I've been mourning the nights that never were, one of them has been unfolding here before me. This is no get-together. This is a party. [Robert strips, jumps in pool, Gabe and Ryan join him]",
        "All: Yes! Woohoo! Bravo!",
        "Jim: And there's my talking point.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Robert: Yes, that's it. Push yourselves, boys. It's not a party if you don't do something that scares you. I need a breather. Oh. Oh. You two keep going.",
        "Ryan: Hey, he's asleep. We can just leave.",
        "Gabe: So leave."
