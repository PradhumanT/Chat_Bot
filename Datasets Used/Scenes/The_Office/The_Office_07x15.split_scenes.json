        "Meredith: Sweet! Free Ring!",
        "Andy: Divorced?",
        "Ryan: Just so you know, it's totally amicable. We're fine. We don't need people here to take sides.",
        "Kelly: The last thing that we want is any kind of drama.",
        "Pam: Wait. Can you back up? What's the story?",
        "Kelly: We were having a beautiful weekend in the Poconos. We were making love, constantly. We saw the sunrise. Ryan was crying a lot.",
        "Ryan: It's not irrelevant. Details",
        "Kelly: And in the morning we walked by a chapel and we stopped, suddenly, and Ryan said...",
        "Ryan and Kelly: I don't think I should be married to you anymore.",
        "Kevin: What?",
        "Andy: Sorry, when did you get married?",
        "Kelly: Ummm, like a week ago, we got really wasted and it just felt right.",
        "Andy: And you didn't invite any of us?",
        "Ryan: We are getting divorced, Andy! This is such a raw time.",
        "Kelly: God baby, you know, people's reactions to this... maybe we made a mistake.",
        "Ryan: No, with the messed up laws in this country, I don't want to be married until everyone can be married.",
        "Oscar: You know what Ryan, I talked to the other gay guys, and we're ok with it. We agree it's fine if you got married.",
        "Ryan: No Oscar, Not, not until everyone can!",
        "Kelly: Ryan, I changed my mind.",
        "Ryan: Ok fine, you know what, this actually isn't amicable at all and we actually do need people to take sides. Who is on my side?",

        "Holly: For what?",
        "Michael: You broke up with AJ weeks ago.",
        "Holly: Don't you have a sales call to go on?",
        "Michael: I don't understand. I really don't. I mean, we know we are going to start dating. Why not now?",
        "Holly: We don't know that.",
        "Michael: Sure we do.",
        "Holly: Why is it such a certainty that we are supposed to be together?",
        "Michael: Why does the sun rise in the morning? Why do magnets stick together? Because everybody says so. Everybody.",
        "Holly: Michael, I can't keep getting into a situation where I date whoever I'm working with. Well, you can understand that.",
        "Michael: Yeah, I understand. I just don't agree.",

        "Pam: All right, what'd you do?",
        "Jim: Well, those things that you consider doodles, I consider art.",

        "Pam: Bye.",

        "Erin: Holly is ruining Michael's life. He thinks she is so special. And she's so not. Her personality is like a 3. Her sense of humor is a 2. Her ears are like a 7and a 4. Add it all up and what do you get? 16. And he treats her like she's a perfect 40. It's nuts.",

        "Jim: Well, I'm going the speed limit. So...",
        "Michael: Okay, fine. My feelings don't matter to you. What matters to you is your precious speed limit.",
        "Jim: Someone's in a bad mood.",
        "Michael: No I'm not. I'm not in a bad mood. I'm not, Jim. Hello? Ok fine, ignore me. Have it your way. Let's just talk about you, as always. Is s*x different after the baby, Jim?",
        "Jim: Alright, let me turn on some music.",
        "Michael: I need to pee.",
        "Jim: No you don't.",
        "Michael: Yeah, I do. My word against yours.",
        "Jim: Alright. Well we'll be there in ten minutes.",
        "Michael: What part of \"I need to pee\" do you not understand? I'm upset. My bladder is full. There is no telling what I might do right now all over the inside of your precious little car.",
        "Jim: Alright, Well if I see a gas station, I'll pull over.",

        "Jim: Nothing. Absolutely nothing. You're not holding a cup of coffee or anything are you?",
        "Pam: Jim, what?",
        "Jim: Uh, so, Cece had a little bit of a fever. And your mom also locked her in the car.",
        "Pam: Oh God! What?!",
        "Jim: No no no it's ok. So, Cece is with daddy now. She's laughing and she's happy. And we are on our way to see Dr. Barbra.",
        "Pam: Ok. She's ok?",
        "Jim: Yes, and your mom got a very well deserved day off. So here's the thing though. I left Michael at the gas station on Benet.",

        "Attendant: Just make it quick.",
        "Michael: Ok. I will make it quick. I will make it very quick. [opens phone] And you don't have my numbers on speed dial. Ah, Ok. What is it?",
        "Attendant: You don't know it.",
        "Michael: You know what, I can dial 411, get Jim's number.",
        "Attendant: He left you here on purpose. All right? I saw it. He just drove away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Oscar: Which on in particular?",
        "Andy: Yeah, which one?",
        "Pam: Well the first one has a surprise factor. \"I'm a suck suck-suckidy Sabre!\"",
        "Andy: Boo-yea! [office laughs]",
        "Gabe: No no. No no no.",
        "Pam: But, ah, I suppose the second one is the better written line.",
        "Oscar: You suppose?",
        "Darryl: What's it say?",
        "Oscar: \"I'm suppose to be wearing red gloves but my color cartridge portal, got jammed again.\"",

        "Pam: You guys, if I knew you wanted to do a caption contest, I would have drawn something more challenging.",
        "Darryl: And I will take you all down.",
        "Andy: You?",
        "Darryl: I've been reading the comics to my daughter since she was three years old. Not once I have used the real captions to Family Circus. That crazy family is hilarious to her for one reason[/b]: me.",
        "Andy: Oh it is on like Genghis Khan wearing Sean Jean in Buton.",

        "Attendant: Yeah, he just left.",
        "Holly: Which way did he go?",
        "Dwight: Hey hey hey. Let me answer this. Stupid question. He went back to the office, obviously, which is that way.",
        "Holly: Oh really? You don't think he walked by the bakery just for the smell of it?",
        "Attendant: She's right. He went that way.",
        "Dwight: Alright. Don't get a swelled head. You're no tracker. [Dwight and Erin low-five] Let's ride.",

        "Michael: [at puppies] Hey you guys. Listen to me. Don't get hung up on just one girl because there are a whole lot of other girls out there. Look over there. See? They look cute. [at parrots] Hello! You guys are so beautiful. You're so colorful. I wish I could understand you. That's a metaphor I guess. [at snake] You are disgusting. You'll never find love. Yekkk. [holding puppy] Do you think she needs more time or is it never going to happen? [licks his nose] I'm being serious. Seriously.",

        "Pam: No, he hasn't.",
        "Dwight: Goodbye.",
        "Pam: No, wait. Hey, while you are out, could pick up some paper towels and chocolate syrup? We have ice cream so I thought...",
        "Dwight: Pam, this isn't a shopping trip.",
        "Erin: No.",
        "Dwight: This is a man-hunt slash rescue mission.",
        "Pam: Ok. I, just, when you are done or any time it's convent, I just thought since you are out...",
        "Dwight: Pam, I'm obviously going to get that stuff for you so just shut up.",
        "Pam: Ok, well it wasn't obvious so... [phone hangs up]",
        "Dwight: No word from Michael.",
        "Holly: Oh.",

        "Office: Boo!",
        "Meredith: Why?",
        "Gabe: Unless we can all agree to some ground rules. It's either that or I can fax this to Joe and let her decide how to proceed.",
        "Darryl: Gabe, tell us your stupid rules so we can start the game.",
        "Gabe: Number one, and this should be obvious, no captions that insult the company we work for.",
        "Oscar: Irony is such a critical...",
        "Gabe: Number two[/b]: no pop culture references.",
        "Pam: Seriously?",
        "Oscar: Wow.",
        "Gabe: I think we can all agree that they tend to alienate those who don't get the reference, making them feel like the other.",
        "Darryl: Wrap it up, Gabe.",
        "Gabe: Ok final thing, and this is a fun one[/b]: Instead of writing the caption directly under the picture, let's all try using Sticky Quips. All right? New, from Dunder Mifflin Sabre.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gabe: Sticky Quips are fun. They are safe. They are handy. I like to use Sticky Quips as regular Post-It notes when I am in a fun mood. [laughs] Not every day.",

        "Michael: Well I understand that but this is a $45 watch.",
        "Hot Dog Guy: Wow.",
        "Michael: With that I can buy... half the menu.",
        "Hot Dog Guy: I can't just go giving away hot dogs.",
        "Michael: All right. What do you do with the hog dogs that you don't sell?",
        "Hot Dog Guy: Throw 'em away.",
        "Michael: Well, okay, instead of throwing them all away later, why don't you just throw one away now into my mouth?",
        "Hot Dog Guy: No.",

        "Holly: Are their egg rolls really that big?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Oh, boy. That was yummy. Thank you so much. You know what? I think I left my wallet in my car. Do you mind if I run out and get it?",
        "Waiter: No problem.",
        "Michael: Okay. I'll be right back. [goes to leave but walks back]. Okay. You know what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't have my wallet and I was gonna try to dine and dash and that was stupid and I realize I can't do that to you fine people.",
        "Waiter: So you can't pay for your food?",
        "Michael: Well I can, but I will have to come back later tonight and pay you. But the point is I did the right thing.",

        "Waiter: He just left.",
        "Erin: You knew.",
        "Holly: What? No. Dwight asked if I wanted an egg roll. What... what are you implying?",

        "Holly: I don't know.",
        "Dwight: Okay, close your eyes, we need you to think. What is Michael seeing right now? Can you tell him that we miss him? Michael we're coming for you!",
        "Holly: Will you stop! There has been a few coincidences, that's all.",
        "Dwight: All right then. Someone propose a plan.",
        "Erin: Okay. We fan out...",
        "Dwight: Not you, Erin.",
        "Holly: Stop looking at me like that. Okay, let's just go up somewhere high and see if we could spot him on the street below.",
        "Dwight: That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard. No. Tap into your common mind and tell us what he would do next.",
        "Holly: Look, I'm not playing. I'm gonna go look for him.",
        "Erin: Good. We don't need her.",
        "Dwight: Right. I can do this on my own. I can think like Michael. All right... I'm deep below the ocean's surface in a submarine. A torpedo's coming right at me. No. Damn it, that's just my own imagination. Maybe he's bowling.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
