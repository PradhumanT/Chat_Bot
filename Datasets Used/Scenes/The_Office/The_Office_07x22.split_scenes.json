        "Dwight: [walking up] Michael?",
        "Michael: Yes?",
        "Dwight: I've got a treat for you!",
        "Michael: Ahh, thank you. Like a butler.",
        "Dwight: Colorado specialty, Rocky Mountain Oysters.",
        "Michael: [Michael takes one and bites] Oh, these do not taste like oysters.",
        "Dwight: [angrily] That's because they're Not oysters, they're bull testicles! I cut them off fresh this morning! [Michael spits it out] Hah!",
        "Michael: Sick freak! What is wrong with you?",
        "Dwight: What is wrong with you? I'm the sick freak? After what you did? You expect to be buttled? You didn't recommend me?!",
        "Michael: I don't own Dunder Mifflin, okay? [Dwight scoffs] The job was not mine to give. [sighs] Look, I need your advice on something. I am told that there are bears in the Rockies.",
        "Dwight: Where did you hear that? Obvious XM Radio?",
        "Michael: Well, I was just thinking that maybe I should keep a salami in my pocket...",
        "Dwight: Great idea.",
        "Michael: ...in order to feed the bears.",
        "Dwight: Especially if you think that life would be better without Legs!",
        "Michael: How do you mean?",
        "Dwight: Black Bears can smell a salami at five miles Michael, what are you thinking?! And they run faster than a horse, so if you were thinking about outrunning one on a horse I would try a cheetah. You, in tight pants, Michael, are a salami to a Black Bear. Do you understand? [Michael nods in agreement] You're like a giant walking salami!",
        "Michael: Okay, so no salami in the pants. How about a pepperoni?",
        "Dwight: Any kind of meat that you can possibly name!",
        "Michael: Okay.",

        "DeAngelo: [with Michael in his office] You're not gonna take all these toys are you?",
        "Michael: Hm?",
        "DeAngelo: I mean you don't have a job lined up, so it's not like you have a desk to put 'em on.",
        "Michael: Well I have interviews.",
        "DeAngelo: That's nice. [reaches and a grabs a toy truck] How 'bout that truck? Can I have this little truck? I was thinking I might... glue a stapler on top. Or put a hole here, stick pens in it. [Michael gives an obviously fake smile] You okay?",
        "Michael: Yes. Yes, you know what? Take my favorite truck. Sure.",
        "DeAngelo: You know what? Uh, it's your last couple days, I'm gonna get out of your hair.",
        "Michael: Oh you don't, that's-",

        "Andy: Why don't you, uh, stay away from me?",
        "Gabe: No, I'm gonna stand where I want. Okay? You don't wanna get on my bad side! I've seen some horrible things! I own over two hundred horror movies!",
        "Andy: Okay! That's so weird! Just go away!",
        "Gabe: No! You go away! [storms out, toilet flushes, Jim exits the bathroom]",

        "Angela: Please.",
        "Pam: What's wrong with cupcakes?",
        "Angela: Everything.",
        "Michael: [walking in] There they are! Party Planning Committee together again!",
        "Pam: Well we all wanted to plan your goodbye party. We thought this would be easier.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: We thought.",
        "Angela: It's an experiment.",
        "Phyllis: The three of us have all been chairmen before.",
        "Pam: So this is the dream team.",

        "Pam: [surprised] Okay.",
        "Michael: Tomorrow I want everyone to have a good time. No drama. And as for today, just a typical day. Alright?",
        "Pam: Should we get toppings?",
        "Michael: What do you like Pam?",
        "Pam: [confused] What?",
        "Michael: What kind of toppings would you like?",
        "Pam: Hot fudge?",
        "Michael: Sounds good. Fudge it up! [all seem surprised at Michael's behavior]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: [holding up his \"World's Best Boss Mug\"] I bought this for myself. And yesterday, they gave me this. [holds up a Dundie that reads, 'World's Best Boss 2011, Michael G. Scott', throws his mug into the garbage can and places his Dundie at the front of his desk] I still need something to drink out of though.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: [pulls out a list of everyone in the office, then puts it back in his jacket] Attention everyone, before I leave tomorrow I would like to reveal a secret I have kept for over twenty years. A secret about Phyllis.",

        "Michael: Ahh.",
        "Phyllis: It's almost done, but you can't get them wet, and they can't be dry-cleaned either. You have to hand wash without water, wring-dry gently, and use a hairdryer on cool.",
        "Michael: [hesitantly] Sounds great, I just think it's great. Oh, I have gifts as well! [goes into his office and comes out with a bag] And I will start, by giving the first gift to Phyllis! Phyllis, you are shy and sweet, and you don't often speak your mind, but you should. Because you have great ideas. So Phyllis, I am giving you this, so you can always remember to speak your mind. [presents to her a mouth wind-up chattering toy]",
        "Phyllis: It's cute. [plays with it]",
        "Michael: Stanley, you love your Sudoku and your puzzles, I bestow upon you, my felt. [gives Stanley a small felt table] May you never lose the fun loving quality in life.",
        "Stanley: Where's the rest of it, it's got no balls.",
        "Michael: Well, okay... And Andy, Andy who needs confidence that he is a great salesman. I give you, my clients, our ten most important accounts. [other salesmen look outraged]",
        "Andy: Wow.",
        "Stanley: [angry] Yeah wow!",
        "Andy: You know I'm the worst salesman here right?",
        "Michael: But you're the best salesman, on the inside.",
        "Phyllis: What does that even mean?",
        "Michael: You sold us all on Andy, a product that nobody wanted.",
        "Andy: I'm gonna lose 'em.",
        "Michael: You're not gonna lose them.",
        "Andy: I promise you that I will.",
        "Michael: Just do your best! I have faith in you.",
        "Stanley: [as Michael walks away, Stanley whispers angrily to Andy] Gimme those clients!",
        "Andy: No.",
        "Phyllis: [to Dwight] Do you believe that?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "DeAngelo: I used to be obese. Once you've conquered obesity, everything else is easy. Life literally moves in slow motion. I'm not saying I'm superman, but, let me just put it this way. If I were shot in the head, I'm pretty sure everything would be fine. I almost welcome it. [winks]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Kevin, I have something for you.",

        "Michael: You know who that is?",
        "Kevin: Oh...",
        "Michael: [rips the poster in half] Don't be a caricature Kevin, never be a caricature. How did that feel when I tore that up?",
        "Kevin: Better...",
        "Michael: Good, stand up. [Kevin does so] You will be thin. You Won't drool over pizza like an animal anymore.",
        "Kevin: But...",
        "Michael: You will find love.",
        "Kevin: Michael, I'm pretty much okay with who I am now.",

        "Andy: I just lost Porter Hardware! I just, I lost 'em!",
        "Michael: [quietly groans] Okay, you know what? Just do your best buddy! Okay, Oscar, you are very smart, and you have a gigantic education. And, I think of you as my scarecrow, because you gave me a brain. So that's why I made you this. [takes a sack tied in the upper middle making a crude head, with a face drawn on, obviously the product of poor craftsmanship, Oscar pretends to like it]",
        "Oscar: Thank you Michael. It's beautiful.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: [laughing] It looks like a [more laughing] It looks like it was made by a two year old monkey on a farm! He just accepted, accepted that I put all this work into it! [laughs more] He has the lowest opinion of me, of anybody!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Was it just me, or did you think that we were going to have s*x at some point?",
        "Angela: It was just you...",

        "Angela: Oh, that's Thomas, Robert's aide.",
        "Michael: I guess this could be the one, huh?",

        "Pam: I don't, I don't think we sh-",
        "Meredith: I know what you're thinking, but it's not just black, they do it all. And the women on these cakes, they're not just guy's fantasies. They have real, full women. It is refreshing.",
        "Pam: [stopping her] Okay, don't turn this into some feminist issue.",
        "Phyllis: As a person who buys a lot of erotic cakes, it feels good to be represented on one.",
        "Pam: You know what, I think we should get some other input.",
        "Kelly: I think we should do cupcakes. I am one of the few people who looks hot eating a cupcake.",
        "Phyllis: Yeah, cupcakes. That's what I said.",
        "Angela: No! I'm not cleaning up a bunch of uneaten cupcake bottoms! You know, we don't really care about your opinion. You're just a tie-breaker.",

[to the side again] That's great, if I wanted the dictionary definition I'd buy a dictionary. [reading again, slowly gets sadder] I define it as Dwight Schrute. As a sales executive, as a leader, as a man, and as a friend, he is of the highest kind, quality, and order. Supreme. [holding back tears] Lot's more like that, really repetitive. What's this?

I can't sit here and tell you he's gonna be a success. I can't sit here and tell you that he's even the best man for the job. [Andy looks awkward] But I can say this[/b]: He's got potential. Sure. You know, I always say[/b]: go big, or go home. You go with This guy, you could be making the biggest mistake of your life, OR, the biggest, Good decision of your life. It's either gonna be the best thing you ever did, or the worst thing you ever did. If you want some boring, white bread clock-watcher who's gonna get you your paper when you ordered it, for the agreed upon price, [Andy looks hopeful] Andy's not your guy.

I could tell you that he has a steel plate in his head, or that he's crazy, but the truth is I think he's just a terrible salesman.

The babies that I make with her, will be my children. The people that you work with, are just... when you get down to it... your very best friends. They say, on your deathbed, you never wish you spent more time at the office. But I will. Gotta be a lot better than a deathbed.

[cuts a corner piece, picks it up with his bare hands, and takes a bite] Why'd I just do that? It's not even that good. I don't even want it. I had cake for lunch. [throws the piece in the garbage] No, you know what? I've been good. I deserve this. [grabs a piece from another corner. The office groans] What am I doing?
