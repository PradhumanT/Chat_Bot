        "Michael: The fundamentals of business. The funda-mentals of business. \"Mental\" is part of the word, I have underlined it. Because you're mental, if you don't have a good time. You have to enjoy it.",
        "Toby: Well the \"fun\" is in it. [conference room group chimes agreement.]",
        "Michael: Get out.",
        "Toby: [halfway out] Yeah, I know.",
        "Michael: Yes. So, it all starts with a handshake. But you can't just go right to the selling, you need \"small talk.\" What topics can you use for small talk?",
        "Andy: Golf.",
        "Michael: Mmhm.",
        "Andy: Stock market.",
        "Michael: Mmhm.",
        "Andy: Dave Matthews.",
        "Michael: Yes, what else?",
        "Creed: Uh, small things. Peas, ball bearings, dimes...",
        "Michael: No.",
        "Meredith: The weekend!",
        "Michael: Yeah! That's good! Come on up! Meredith, come up here. Let's do a little something. So Meredith and I have just started conversing and I will say, \"So Meredith, how was your weekend, what did you do?\"",
        "Meredith: Well I caught my son taking a dump on the upper part of the toilet.",
        "Michael: All right...",
        "Meredith: He calls it an upper decker.",
        "Michael: Okay, okay. God. What you people don't know about business, I could fill a book with.",
        "Ryan: Then do it.",
        "Michael: What?",
        "Ryan: Write a book.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: [into mini recorder] The fundamentals of business by Michael Scott. Over one billion sold. More than the Bible, I'm not surprised. Chapter one. The businessman...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Erin: [Michael walks in office, man waits on couch] Mr. Grotti, this is Michael Scott. He's the person you should talk to.",
        "Michael: Oh hi. I'm sorry, just a sec. [whispers] Erin, you're supposed to be the gatekeeper, do you have any idea how valuable my time is?",
        "Erin: In your schedule it just says nine til noon is \"creative space\" and I thought this could be part of that.",
        "Michael: Do you know how creative space works? Okay I just cancelled my afternoon.",
        "Erin: You don't have anything in the afternoon. It just says \"free play.\"",
        "Michael: Push free play til tomorrow morning. [to Grotti] Hi. Sorry. Crazy day. You're seeing how the sausage gets made.",
        "Grotti: Ah.",
        "Michael: Come in the conference room and I will show you a finished sausage.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Grotti: As a manager of business, you have a lot of pride.",
        "Michael: Mmhm.",
        "Grotti: But you also got a lot of responsibility",
        "Michael: Yep.",
        "Grotti: None greater perhaps, than your need to be sure, that your small or large business is secure in the event of a covered loss.",
        "Michael: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: There is nothing more insulting to a great salesman, than having to listen to a bad salesman. It's like a great basketball player having to listen to a bad basketball player.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Jim's gone on his honeymoon. So I started borrowing his office to fart in. Then one day I came in and I just stayed. Cause this place is awesome. It feels like home now. Even better than my home. My home sucks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: What do you think?",
        "Dwight: I think you're right. It definitely looks suspicious. And his southern Italian heritage raises some flags.",
        "Grotti: God forbid you... should have a fire in the warehouse.",
        "Michael: Oh yup. Yeah, definitely. All that paper burning up.",
        "Grotti: Yeah, and a truck, goes off the side of the road, there's injury.",
        "Michael: Mmhm, I hear you. The truck.",
        "Grotti: You will be hearing from me Mr. Scott.",
        "Michael: Okay, well.",
        "Grotti: I can be very very persistent.",
        "Michael: Do your worst. [they shake hands]",
        "Michael: [Grotti knocks over coat stand grabbing his overcoat] Oh, great.",
        "Grotti: Would you look at that people? What an unpredictable world we live in, huh?",
        "Michael: Mmhm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: What happened in there?",
        "Michael: Nothing, other than once again, I am just thankful that I am a paper salesman.",
        "Dwight: Did he threaten you?",
        "Michael: No Dwight, not everything is a threat.",
        "Andy: Mobsters are!",
        "Michael: There is no such things as monsters.",
        "Andy: He drives an SUV!",
        "Dwight: I knew it! More trunk space. Or should I say, corpse space.",
        "Oscar: Hey guys, I drive a SUV, does that mean I'm in the mob?",
        "Dwight: No, not that, by itself. But look at all the facts. He seems like a mobster.",
        "Michael: Wait, when did we start talking about the mob? The guy was trying to sell me insurance.",
        "Andy: All mobsters have a front, sometimes it's selling insurance, sometimes it's waste management or sanitation.",
        "Oscar: For the record, not all Italian-Americans are in the Mafia.",
        "Michael: I think, he just seemed like he was just trying to sell me insurance.",
        "Andy: Yeah, buy my insurance or I'll burn your warehouse down!",
        "Dwight: Exactly.",
        "Michael: He did talk about a fire in the warehouse... and he also vaguely threatened me with testicular cancer.",
        "Oscar: Uhh. All right, who else is here? [looks around]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oscar: Pam and Jim are on their honeymoon. So there's not the usual balance between \"sane and others.\" Toby has mentally checked out since June. It's a very dangerous time. The \"coalition for reason\" is extremely weak.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Toby: Oscar says I checked out huh? Huh. [nods head]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: [over chatter] Hey, hey hey, calm down. Calm down. Calm down. Ryan, you lived in New York, what do you think?",
        "Ryan: Well first of all, there is no such thing as 'The Mafia.'",
        "Michael: Okay.",
        "Ryan: What you have are specific families. What's the guy's last name?",
        "Michael: Um it is, Grotti.",
        "Andy and Dwight: [groans] Oh no. Fabulous.",
        "Oscar: What? What?",
        "Andy: It's John Gotti, you idiot!",
        "Oscar: It's, it's a completely different name!",
        "Phyllis: So he won't get caught!",
        "Andy: Yeah. It's pretty close.",
        "Oscar: No, what are you talking about, what mobster would change his name from Gotti to Grotti. It weakens it.",
        "Dwight: No I disagree. \"R\" is among the most menacing of sounds. That's why they call it \"murder.\" And not \"muck-duck.\"",
        "Michael: Okay too many different words coming at me from too many different sentences.",
        "Dwight: Lock your door!",
        "Michael: I'm not gonna lock my door. [door closes. Then clicks locked]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: Hello?",
        "Oscar: Jim? It's Oscar. I'm so sorry to be calling you on your honeymoon.",
        "Jim: Oscar! Uh, what is going on?",
        "Oscar: It's Michael, he thinks he's being shaken down by the mob. I don't know how you usually handle this.",
        "Jim: Look, We're in Puerto Rico, so-",
        "Pam: Hey Oscar. It's Pam. Hey. We're on our honeymoon.",
        "Oscar: Pam, I'm sorry--",
        "Pam: Unless someone very close to us is in immediate physical danger, you should not be calling us.",
        "Oscar: You're right. You're right. [Pam hangs up] Oh, okay bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: It's Grotti. He's following up.",
        "Andy: Already? This, this guy is persistent!",
        "Michael: [reads email] \"I feel that you will regret missing this great opportunity to be in business.\"",
        "Dwight: That's bad.",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Dwight: That's bad.",
        "Michael: Yeah. What are my options here? Do I just ignore it, or?",
        "Andy: Yeah right! You heard him! He's gonna burn down the warehouse or run one of our trucks off the road.",
        "Michael: Okay, I'm calling the police.",
        "Andy: [hangs up, rips cord from phone] That is the stupidest thing you could do right now!",
        "Dwight: He's right. Cops can't do anything until a crime has been reported.",
        "Michael: All right.",
        "Andy: Not only that, but if they find out you snitched, you get a dead horses chopped off head in your bed!",
        "Michael: Shh!",
        "Dwight: You know what?",
        "Michael: That's not gonna happen.",
        "Dwight: That's an exaggeration.",
        "Andy: That's how it works!",
        "Michael: What am I supposed to do here?",
        "Andy: When somebody threatens you, you give in right away. Okay you need to buy insurance from this guy and get him off your back",
        "Michael: I was thinking exactly the same thing.",
        "Dwight: No, criminals are like raccoons. Okay, you give 'em a taste of cat food pretty soon they'll be back for the whole cat.",
        "Andy: Dwight...",
        "Dwight: The only way to defeat a bully is to stand up to him. Trust me, I have bullied a lot of people.",
        "Michael: I don't know, I don't know about that.",
        "Andy: Wait let's hear him out, this is interesting.",
        "Dwight: Here's what we do. We meet him in a public place. Ask him to lunch or something like that, some place he can't be openly violent.",
        "Andy: Okay.",
        "Dwight: Let him know you're not the typical kind of guy that he can shake down. That you're stubborn. That you might even be a little bit dangerous.",
        "Andy: [snaps fingers] I like this plan. I'd like to officially withdraw my plan.",
        "Michael: Hold on, hold on! Just-",
        "Andy: No, no, no. My plan is out! We do this the hard way.",
        "Michael: All right. I will meet with him, but I'm not going alone.",
        "Andy: Well you're gonna have to. [overlaps] Dwight[/b]: We'll be right beside you.",
        "Andy: What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: [Andy dressed as a mechanic, Cornell hat on] What are you wearing? Who's Pat?",
        "Andy: Well if I'm gonna back you up, I need a weapon without drawing suspicion, and I have to justify it somehow so, I'm a mechanic with a tire thing.",
        "Dwight: Do you know how to use it?",
        "Andy: To change tires, no. But it's metal, I can hit somebody with it.",
        "Michael: Let's go, come on. [whispers] God!",
        "Andy: Should I change?",
        "Dwight: You're wearing loafers!",
        "Michael: Forget it! Forget it!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: [Andy is playing with the tire iron] Take that thing off the table! Please!",
        "Andy: Well then I can't use it. I'm just gonna hide it.",
        "Dwight: Hey. Bathroom checks out clean. Nothing behind the toilet except for this roach motel.",
        "Andy: Oh! God! [smacks roaches]",
        "Michael: Oh my God!",
        "Dwight: You'll never kill it that way. You want to separate the head from the thorax-",
        "Michael: Guys, guys. Cool it. There he is, there he is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Hello.",
        "Grotti: Mr. Scott.",
        "Michael: Mr. Grotti we meet again. These are my associates.",
        "Grotti: Hi. Angelo Grotti.",
        "Andy: Hi.",
        "Dwight: Hello.",
        "Grotti: So, you got this table?",
        "Michael: Yes.",
        "Grotti: This is one of those half booths, can't-decide-what-it-is type of thing.",
        "Michael: Well.",
        "Grotti: Waitress, we're gonna sit over here.",
        "Waitress: That's fine.",
        "Michael: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: [answers phone] Hello.",
        "Credit card rep: Hello Mr. Halpert. I'm calling from the identity theft department at Capital One. We've detected some unusual activity on your credit card.",
        "Kevin: Oh man, do you think it was stolen?",
        "Rep: First would you mind verifying your home address?",
        "Kevin: Um, yes. [looks at Jim's pay stub] Um, 383 Linden Ave., Scranton PA",
        "Rep: And may I have the last four numbers of your Social Security Number?",
        "Kevin: Six-six-five-zero.",
        "Rep: Well Mr. Halpert. You're obviously not in San Juan Puerto Rico.",
        "Kevin: Wait a minute. Yes I am.",
        "Rep: I'm going to go ahead and put a hold on your card.",
        "Kevin: No. That... I, I think that we should let the criminal use the card a little longer.",
        "Rep: Very funny sir. We'll get a new card out to you right away.",
        "Kevin: No-",
        "Rep: Have a nice day, and thank you!",
        "Kevin: Shoot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Grotti: If you want to supplement your coverage, we can do that. If you want to replace your current coverage, all the better. Ah, you seem like a nice guy.",
        "Dwight: Oh he's not that nice.",
        "Michael: That's not true.",
        "Andy: Hmm. Very true.",
        "Michael: Okay shut up.",
        "Waitress: Have you decided?",
        "Grotti: Yeah, I'll have the linguini, red sauce on the side. If the sauce does not come on the side, I will send it back. I want garlic bread, toasted, not burnt. If it comes burnt, I will send it back.",
        "Waitress: Okay then. And for you sir?",
        "Michael: I will have the gabba-gool.",
        "Waitress: The... what?",
        "Michael: The gabba-gool.",
        "Waitress: I don't really know what that is.",
        "Andy: [with Soprano's inflection] You know, gabba-gool.",
        "Michael: I don't, I don't have to have that.",
        "Dwight: What he's trying to say is, Gabba. Gool.",
        "Michael: Guys, guys-",
        "Waitress: I don't really think that we have that.",
        "Michael: That's okay.",
        "Dwight: Bring him the gabba-gool!",
        "Michael: Shh. I will have the spaghetti, with a side salad.",
        "Waitress: Okay.",
        "Michael: If the salad is on top, I send it back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oscar: Why would you cancel Jim's credit cards?",
        "Kevin: I usually can think quick on my feet, but they were so fast on the phone.",
        "Oscar: This constitutes identity fraud.",
        "Kevin: Oh God. I wouldn't last in jail Oscar. I'm not like you.",
        "Oscar: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Kevin: Oh you don't know about jail? Oh you would love jail.",
        "Oscar: Why would I love jail?",
        "Kevin: Because... You would love it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: I don't think our company actually needs any more insurance. So I am out.",
        "Grotti: Look closely Michael. I feel there's a plan here for you.",
        "Andy: Maybe we have a plan for you?",
        "Grotti: How about you? Maybe you can use supplemental coverage of some kind. Anybody can get hurt! You always think, it can't happen to you, and [drops hand loudly on table] Think about it.",
        "Woman: [approaches with child] Excuse me. Sorry to bother you. Are you a mechanic?",
        "Andy: Yeeeeah.",
        "Woman: My battery is dead, I've got my kid, can you please help?",
        "Andy: Yes I can.",
        "Michael: No, no no, no. Come on. I'm sorry, we're having our salad.",
        "Grotti: Come on! Lady in distress? Go! Go!",
        "Andy: Okay!",
        "Woman: Thank you so much, I really appreciate it.",
        "Michael: Hey, do you need any help?",
        "Grotti: I'm sure he can handle a simple jump-start. Now come on, sit down.",
        "Michael: He's a good mechanic.",
        "Grotti: Where were we?",
        "Michael: I don't...",
        "Dwight: He was trying to force you to decide on a policy.",
        "Michael: Okay, okay okay.",
        "Dwight: So we're choosing...",
        "Michael: Yep, all right.",
        "Dwight: Check out Dental?",
        "Michael: Put it down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: Black goes on the red. With the... If we... Positive... Mo- it being a motor drive, it's probably down.",
        "Kid: He seems bad at this.",
        "Andy: You want to do this junior? I didn't think so. Sorry. It's kind of a long day at the... mechanic store. [Andy places connections wrong, smoke and explosion set off] Aaaah! You got a leaky spark tube.",
        "Woman: What?!?",
        "Andy: So your car's totaled. Uh, you're just gonna want to get a refund on that. Or my guy could do it. He's great. But uh, I can't do that for you. I work exclusively on motorcycles. [Andy walks away, woman is exasperated]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Grotti: Now if you could just sign this letter of intent, I'll bring this back to my boss, and we can get this in motion. [Andy clears throat loudly] You okay, Pat?",
        "Andy: Yeah. Just thinking about how, uh, I had this car, this Italian car, and I was driving it, and it kept telling me how much it needed oil, but I wouldn't give it any oil. And then, one day it exploded and it killed everyone and that's what I'm afraid of.",
        "Grotti: Aren't you a mechanic? Why wouldn't you put oil in the car?",
        "Andy: It was before, my tech- my technical training.",
        "Dwight: Don't do it!",
        "Andy: Do it.",
        "Dwight: Don't.",
        "Andy: Just do it.",
        "Michael: Okay.",
        "Grotti: Look Mike, I don't know what your friends are telling you, but you have to decide for yourself. Are these guys gonna take care of your things if you die tomorrow?",
        "Dwight: Yes.",
        "Michael: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: I don't understand, why would you buy a policy?",
        "Michael: It's just the cost of a cup of coffee an hour.",
        "Andy: You were man enough to back down Michael, I'm proud of you.",
        "Michael: I had to make a snap decision Dwight.",
        "Dwight: It wasn't a snap decision, you were sitting there for an hour.",
        "Michael: It was a lot of snap decisions.",
        "Dwight: Do you know what \"snap decision\" means?",
        "Michael: Yes!",
        "Dwight: It means like this. [snaps fingers]",
        "Michael: Just get in the car.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: Hello?",
        "Michael: Jim?",
        "Jim: Michael?",
        "Michael: Oh thank God.",
        "Jim: How did you get this number? Michael, we're on a catamaran.",
        "Michael: It wasn't easy. I had to tell the hotel it was a medical emergency. I chose massive coronary, cause you told me that your Dad had a bad heart. Listen man, I, I got a problem, I think I'm in trouble with the mob. Or a major insurance carrier.",
        "Jim: That sounds bad.",
        "Michael: Yeah, I know and you usually can get out of stuff like this, so I'm turning to you my friend.",
        "Jim: I'm gonna help you through it all right?",
        "Michael: Okay!",
        "Jim: All you're gonna need to [faking a bad connection] and- it- and then go to--",
        "Michael: Jim? Are you?",
        "Jim: And then you'll be saved.",
        "Michael: What? Wait, I didn't hear a thing you just said.",
        "Jim: Just [drops] and then you'll be saved.",
        "Michael: No! God! I missed, I missed the important part again!",
        "Jim: A- ah--",
        "Michael: No! Oh my God!",
        "Jim: And you'll be saved.",
        "Michael: No, Jim please, repeat what you're saying! I can't understand you!",
        "Jim: I [drops out] at the Bermuda Triangle. An- M- please don't call again.",
        "Michael: Jim?!? [dial tone] Oh my God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Hey uh, question for you. I recently purchased some insurance that I can't afford given my present salary. Is there anything accounting-wise I can do to sort of make it all go away?",
        "Oscar: Accounting-wise, no. But phone-wise, just call up and cancel it.",
        "Michael: Oh no. Um. What about this Cash For Clunkers thing?",
        "Oscar: Just- no. No.",
        "Michael: All right. Well, it was a thought. Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: We have let Michael down, and it's 85 percent your fault.",
        "Andy: He's alive. So you're welcome.",
        "Dwight: Not on the inside he's not. Look at his life! Broke! Living in fear! No friends, dead end job.",
        "Andy: Yeah, some of that existed before.",
        "Dwight: Not the living in fear, that's new.",
        "Andy: You're right, that is new.",
        "Dwight: Yes. He's got to stand up to this mafia guy.",
        "Andy: Well I don't see that happening.",
        "Dwight: Me neither. Not the way things are now. But what if Michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy?",
        "Andy: Are you saying-",
        "Dwight: Yeah...",
        "Andy: That we surgically remove the fear center from Michael's brain?",
        "Dwight: What is wrong with you? I am talking about convincing Michael that the guy's not mafia!",
        "Andy: That seems a little far-fetched.",
        "Dwight: Well more far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown? And that happened.",
