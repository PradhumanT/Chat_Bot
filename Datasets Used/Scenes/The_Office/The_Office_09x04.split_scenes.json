        "Nellie: Oh of course, you were adopted.",
        "Erin: [laughs] I wish! No, I um, I made some short lists. I had a couple sleepovers, but I never managed to get in the end zone. I don't know what it was. Not loveable maybe? [laughs] Oh well.",
        "Nellie: Listen, I'm really struggling with this form. But as you know the system, you think maybe you could..?",

        "Nellie: Oh thank you so much!",
        "Erin: [whispers] Just don't tell Andy, because..",

        "Pam: Oh my god! Ah!",
        "Jim: I'll get you a napkin. Someone get napkins please!",
        "Pam: You know what? It's fine, it's fine. Let me just...it's fine. [Pam leaves work bus]",
        "Jim: Pam, I'm really sorry. I- I'm really sorry about...all that. [Dwight smiles at Jim] Really? Smirking?",
        "Dwight: What can I say? I love justice. You forced me to spend money on needless repairs, and uh now you're locked in a prison bus and your woman drips with beverage.",
        "Jim: Hey, Dwight. I was trying to do something nice for Pam. Can you just, help me out? Can we maybe take this thing somewhere? Or do something to not make this the worst day ever?",
        "Dwight: It's not my responsibility to solve your marriage problems by spending my money on gas.",
        "Jim: Andy!",
        "Andy: Yo. Dudeces.",
        "Jim: You're the boss. Don't you think we'd all be a lot more productive if while we were doing work we looked up and saw the best rural pie stand in Pennsylvania?",
        "Phyllis: Oh, I know I'd be more productive.",
        "Kevin: As would I.",
        "Stanley: No question.",
        "Dwight: No. No! This is a work bus. The wheels are for transporting the work space to and from the work site.",
        "Jim: What are you talking about? You're not the boss. Andy is. Andy?",
        "Phyllis, Kevin & Stanley: Pies! Pies! Pies! Pies! Pies!",

        "Jim: If by lately you mean the last twelve years, yeah.",
        "Pam: No, I mean he's sulking. That's not like him.",
        "Jim: He's just mad that we're all having fun.",
        "Pam: Then why isn't he scheming? Or preparing to avenge?",
        "Jim: He's fine. He's indestructible.",

        "Group: Next stop pies!",
        "Kevin: Next stop pies!",
        "Jim: Let's go driver! [clapping] Laverne packs up the pie wagon at five so...",
        "Kevin: At five? That's only twenty minutes from now. The pie shop is thirteen miles away. So at fifty five miles an hour that just gives us five minutes to spare.",
        "Angela: So wait, when pies are involved you can suddenly do math in your head?",
        "Kevin: Wh...",
        "Oscar: Hold on, Kevin, how much is 19,154 pies divided by 61 pies?",
        "Kevin: 314 pies.",
        "Oscar: What if it were salads?",
        "Kevin: Well, it's the...carry the four...and...it doesn't work.",
        "Dwight: I'm sorry to spoil Jim's fantastic voyage everyone, but we're almost out of gas.",
        "Jim: OK, well I saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop.",
        "Dwight: That name brand place? Nope forget about it, sorry. The tanks are so big on this thing, five cents a gallon extra, that really adds up.",
        "Jim: Are you kidding me? Dwight, come on!",
        "Pam: Hey honey, I don't think we should push him.",
        "Jim: Oh no, I'm gonna push him. You know why? Because you're getting a pie. Why? Cause you deserve it. And what is he doing? He's trying to drive us all around the countryside looking for gas because he knows we won't get there. Is that what we want?!",
        "Group: No!",
        "Dwight: Stop ordering me around, Jim!",
        "Jim: What do we want?!",
        "Group: Pies!",

        "Group: Pies!",
        "Dwight: OK, fine. You win. Jim, you win. We have been battling for a long time, but you know what? You win, cause you are the winner, you are the alpha male, there you go. [drops keys in Jim's lap] Alpha male, go buy your wife a pie. Go buy the whole world a pie.",

        "Pam: Phyllis! That's not safe.",
        "Kevin: Guys, we only have eighteen minutes left. At sixty one miles an hour we're just gonna barely make it.",
        "Pam: [to Jim] Go up and check on him. He's upset.",
        "Jim: You know he's doing all this on purpose.",
        "Pam: Please? Just make sure he's OK? [Jim climbs through hatch]",
        "Stanley: Hurry it up for god's sake. They're gonna be out of banana cream!",
        "Andy: Banana cream is the first to go. We'll be lucky to get pumpkin at this point! [group gasps]",

        "Dwight: I'm barren, Jim.",
        "Jim: What?",
        "Dwight: My trouser hives are void of honey. I had congress with Angela and the child that she bore did not issue from my loins. I thought I would be a father and instead I am a eunuch. Neutered by my own building.",
        "Jim: Is this about the popcorn? Or the X on the ceiling? Dwight, that was a prank.",
        "Dwight: You mean you flooded my building with dangerous electromagnetic radiation as a prank?",
        "Jim: No.",
        "Dwight: That's genius. That's the best prank you've ever done. [laughs]",
        "Jim: I'll take it.",

        "Nellie: Andy?",
        "Andy: Who is it?",
        "Nellie: Um, is this a good time?",
        "Andy: Yeah. Perfect time. I'm right in the middle of a rooftop crisis. [takes paper from Nelly] Fine, let me read it. What do we have here? Uh, ok, [reading] blah blah blah blah blah, dah dah dah dah dah dah, you've made this very easy for me. It's unsignable.",
        "Nellie: Oh, why, is there something?",
        "Andy: It's inaccurate, dishonest and...in a word? Dongwater.",
        "Nellie: Ah well, perhaps I could rewrite some of the-",
        "Andy: Here's the thing, you asked me to do you a favor? I did it. I read it. Thank you very much to me for my time. Good luck with your impossible dream.",
        "Nellie: Alright then.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: Dwight, sometimes it takes couples years to get pregnant.",
        "Dwight: Really? How long did it take you and Pam to conceive?",
        "Jim: That doesn't matter.",
        "Dwight: What position did you use to conceive?",
        "Jim: Ok...that's not...",
        "Dwight: Regular? Or lady on her back? You used lady on her back, didn't you, you freak. Yuck, gross. Never mind, Jim.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: [To Pete. Crying sounds come from behind Nelly's curtain] British women. Famously overemotional. Am I right?",
        "Pete: I don't think that's Nelly.",
        "Andy: What?",
        "Nellie: Oh, oh no, no. Look, it's alright. [Erin cries, Nelly comforts her] It really isn't your fault. No, no. Look, it's...you were so kind. And it isn't anything to do with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: Did you ever think that because you own the building, everyone in it, we're all kinda like your children?",
        "Dwight: You know there's a phrase about that in German. Bildenkinder. Used almost exclusively by childless landlords to console themselves. But now? I really understand it.",
        "Jim: Well, now you have a bus full of real..bilden..kin..",
        "Dwight: Bildenkinder.",
        "Jim: OK. And they're all dangerously close to not getting pie. And there's only one guy who can save them. It's not me.",
