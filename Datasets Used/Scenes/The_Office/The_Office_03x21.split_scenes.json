        "Jim: [Dressed as Dwight] It's kind of blurry. [puts on his glasses] That's better. [exhales] Question. What kind of bear is best?",
        "Dwight: That's a ridiculous question.",
        "Jim: False. Black bear.",
        "Dwight: Well that's debatable. There are basically two schools of thought---",
        "Jim: Fact. Bears eat beets. Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.",
        "Dwight: Bears do not--- What is going on--- What are you doing?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: Last week, I was in a drug store and I saw these glasses. Uh, four dollars. And it only cost me seven dollars to recreate the rest of the ensemble. And that's a grand total of... [Jim calculates the total on his calculator-watch] eleven dollars.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: You know what? Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, so I thank you. [Jim places a bobble-head on his desk] Identity theft is not a joke, Jim! Millions of families suffer every year!",
        "Jim: ... MICHAEL!",
        "Dwight: Oh, that's funny. MICHAEL!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: [on phone] Yes, I understand. Can I transfer you to customer relations?",
        "Jim: [on phone] Absolutely. I couldn't be more sorry about this.",
        "Phyllis: [on phone] I know, I know. We're all trying to get to the bottom of this.",
        "Stanley: [on phone] I am upset. Don't I sound upset?",
        "Michael: [on phone] It is disgusting. I totally agree. Well, we're going to recalling all of that paper.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: We have a crisis. Apparently, a disgruntled employee at the paper mill decided that it would be funny to put an obscene watermark on our 24 pound cream butter stock. Five hundred boxes has gone out, with the image of a beloved cartoon duck, performing... unspeakable acts upon a certain cartoon mouse that a lot of people like. I've never been a fan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Everybody in here. STAT. No time to lose. Cri-Man-Squa. F and C, doubletime.",
        "Dwight: Cri-Man-Squa?",
        "Michael: Crisis Management Squad.",
        "Ryan: F and C, doubletime?",
        "Michael: Front and Center. Twice as fast as you would normally go. Any other questions?",
        "Jim: One more. Why are you talking like that?",
        "Michael: To save time, Jim.",
        "Karen: Actually I think you could make the argument that it wastes time.",
        "Pam: Yeah, she has a good point. I mean, for example, with the last thing you said, by the time you explained it, it actually took up more time.",
        "Michael: You know what? Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh! Forget it. Where is Creed?",
        "Creed: Here.",
        "Michael: Creed. Quality assurance. Your job. I really think you screwed the pooch on one, Creed. Because of you, the entire company is in jeopardy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Creed: Every week I'm supposed to take four hours and do a quality spot-check at the paper mill. And of course the one year I blow it off, this happens.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: We have a lot of angry customers out there. This puts us at threat level midnight. Accounting, you are on customer service duty today.",
        "Oscar: That's really not our job.",
        "Michael: Midnight, Oscar! Don't worry, Kelly will be training you first.",
        "Angela: Kelly's training us?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Jim, big fire in your house. Your client, Dunmore High-school, sent out their prom invitations on this paper. Went home to all the kids.",
        "Jim: Yeah, I gotta call out on that.",
        "Michael: No, no, no, no. Not good enough. This is a keystone account. I want you in the school. In person.",
        "Jim: All right.",
        "Michael: I want you to bring a partner.",
        "Ryan: I'll go.",
        "Michael: No, sweet cheeks. We need someone who's actually made a sale. Andy, you go.",
        "Andy: [English accent] William Dolittle at your service. A.K.A., Will Do.",
        "Jim: Yeah, I'm definitely gonna go alone.",
        "Michael: No, no. I need two men on this. That's what she said. No time! But she did. NO TIME! Guys, get on this. Dwight, I want you to be in charge of the press conference.",
        "Dwight: Yes! You are entering the \"No Spin Zone!\"",
        "Pam: We're having a press conference?",
        "Michael: No, Pam. The press is just gonna find out by themselves.",
        "Dwight: Not! [scoffs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Here's the thing. When a company screws up, best thing to do is call a press conference. Alert the media, and then you control the story. Wait for them to find out, and the story controls you. That's what happened to O.J.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: I have invited Barbara Allen, one of our oldest clients, to come in here, and meet with me, for a personal apology. The press wants a story, I will give them a story.",
        "Jim: Oh, did the press ask for a story?",
        "Michael: Here is your headline. \"Scranton Area Paper Company, Dunder Mifflin, apologizes to valued client. Some companies still know how business is done.\" Okay? Battle stations everybody, let's go, go, go, go, go, go!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Creed: Yes, hello. Creed Bratton, Quality Assurance, Dunder Mifflin Scranton. I was supposed to meet with one of your floor managers last week for a quality inspection, and he or she wasn't there. And I'm trying to remember who it was. Mm-hmm. Who wasn't there last week? Debbie Brown. And which day was that? Wednesday, the eleventh. Perfect.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Creed: The only difference between me and a homeless man is this job. I will do whatever it takes to survive. Like I did... when I was a homeless man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you're not good at interacting with people. But guess what? From now on, you guys are no longer losers! So give yourselves a round of applause. [Kelly and Kevin clap]",
        "Oscar: I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer calls.",
        "Kelly: I know, right? Probably a lot.",
        "Angela: Can you just tell us what we need to do so we can go?",
        "Kelly: OK, Angela. I love your enthusiasm. All you need to know how to do is pick up the phone and say \"Customer Service, this is Kelly!\" Except don't say \"Kelly,\" say your own name. Or if you're bored, you can just make up a name. Like one time, I said I was Bridget Jones, [in an English accent] and I talked like this for the whole conversation!",
        "Kevin: Oh! Can I be [horrible Australian accent] Australian, mate?",
        "Kelly: [in accent] Absolutely!",
        "Kevin: [in accent] 'ello, mate!",
        "Kelly: [in accent] I like ice cream! I need a boyfriend.",
        "Kevin: [in accent] I like ice cream too, mate. Alligators and dingo babies.",

        "Andy: Beer me!",
        "Jim: What's that?",
        "Andy: Hand me that water. I always say \"Beer me.\" Gets a laugh like a quarter of the time. So how's what's-her-name?",
        "Jim: You know her name.",
        "Andy: Who, Karen? Yeah, she's only one of my oldest friends. [takes swig of water] Mmm. How's the apartment hangin'?",
        "Jim: It's fine.",
        "Andy: Nice. Check out this sunshine, man. Global warming, right? Today was supposed to be really cold, I bet.",
        "Jim: What about music? Do you have any music?",
        "Andy: Uh, yeah. Should have said so. [sings] Rha-dah-dah-dah! Give me the beat, boys, and free my soul. I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away-he-hay. Ruu-da-doo-da-doo, ba-dit-da-doo-da-dun, Give me the beat, boys, and free my little-ole-soul, I wa--",
        "Jim: I was thinkin' about more like a CD, or... a CD.",
        "Andy: Your call, dude. My girlfriend made an awesome mix. Beer me that disc.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: Lord, beer me strength.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: So, Tuna. When we get in there, let's do a really good job, okay?",
        "Jim: Did that really need to be said?",
        "Andy: Well not everything a guy says needs to be said. Sometimes it's just about the music of the conversation.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: Whoa! What the--- Why is my girlfriend here?",
        "Jim: Oh, is she that teacher in the white?",
        "Andy: No, she's a part-time frozen yogurt chef.",
        "Jim: Which one... is she?",
        "Andy: The one in the green hoodie.",
        "Jim: Wow.",
        "Andy: I wonder if she's, like, a... a guidance counselor, or something?",
        "Jim: No, I don't think so.",
        "Andy: She's like, probably a tutor.",
        "Jim: Nope.",
        "Andy: She probably a t--",
        "Jim: No.",
        "Andy: Sh---",
        "Jim: No.",

        "Michael: OK, press conference in 45. Dwight, make sure this place looks nice.",
        "Dwight: On it. OK, Karen, Ryan, Pam, center stage. Pam, run a comb through your hair.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: First rule in road-side beet sales: Put the most attractive beets on top. The ones that make you pull the car over and go, \"Wow, I need this beet right now.\" Those are the money beets.",

        "Chad Lite: Oh...",
        "Dwight: Don't get too excited, that's out of 20. Right this way. Regional Manager Michael Scott will be addressing the client in the press room shortly. Have a seat, can I get you a beverage?",
        "Chad Lite: Uh, yeah, I'd like uh, uh---",
        "Dwight: [shuts door on him] Great.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: Oh, Andy. You know what? We don't have a lot of time, so we should probably...",

        "Jim: Well... that's not gonna hold up in court.",
        "Andy: Huh... We didn't do anything illegal. Except knock over a mailbox with her friends.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: [on phone] Sir, yes, you have a valid point. I'm sorry. No, I am so sorry.",
        "Oscar: [on phone] Really, Dixon City? ...Carbondale.",
        "Angela: [on phone] Excuse me? Well, I don't see how that's our fault. And I've already told you, the official position of Dunder Mifflin is apologetic, so I don't know what you want from me. [hangs up]",
        "Kelly: OK, first, I just wanna say that you are doing sooo good. Look, you have so many good qualities, that the one that you might wanna work on is, apologizing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Creed: When I went over Wednesday, for the spot-check, I got a call from Debbie Brown, saying she has an emergency dentist appointment.",
        "Dwight: Emergency dentist appointment.",
        "Creed: Now I'm told she told her manager she had the flu. I'm a trusting guy, but uh, I just wish Debbie Brown had been there. We would have caught this.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: And so, with the eyes of the nation upon us, I would like to say that Dunder Mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident. And, as a gesture of gratitude, for your continued loyalty, Mrs. Allen, I would like to present you with this novelty check, for six months of free paper or 25 reams, whichever comes first.",
        "Dwight: [snaps picture with his camera phone] You look good in this.",
        "Michael: So, let us consider this matter ended.",
        "Barbara: Well it isn't ended. I'm... I'm very angry. I--- I could have lost business.",
        "Michael: I know, I know you're angry. And we are truly, truly sorry.",
        "Barbara: I don't accept your apology. The watermark was obscene and horrifying.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: Who was that guy she was talking to? At her locker.",
        "Jim: Not important. Because you're not dating her. Because it's a felony.",
        "Andy: But who was that guy?",
        "Jim: Probably another high-school student.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "School Official: The issue with the watermark is very serious.",
        "Jim: Absolutely.",
        "School Official: We teach our students that character counts.",
        "Jim: And you should.",
        "School Official: But---",
        "Andy: [scoffs] Pfft. You don't teach it well enough. One of your students is a bitch.",
        "Jim: Andy... is having a real rough day today.",
        "Andy: I want to take out an ad, in your yearbook. A full page, two words---",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Ask where he's from.",
        "Angela: [on phone] Where are you from? Ohio? That's nice. So what do you want? [to Kelly] He's upset about the watermark.",
        "Kelly: OK, great. Now tell him that it was an unfortunate error, and we're doing everything we can do to fix it, and that you're sorry.",
        "Angela: [on phone] It was an unfortunate error. We're fixing it. And you already got your money back...",
        "Kelly: And you're sorry.",
        "Angela: ...and the company has already apologized, so you can take that apology or not. [hangs up] [to Kelly] I think he had Tourette's or something!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: We... are going to do everything humanly possible, to ensure that this never happens again.",
        "Barbara: Well, it--- it doesn't help, because it already happened to me.",
        "Michael: The watermark... it's a one time thing.",
        "Barbara: I don't care! It was disgusting. Cartoon characters having s*x?",
        "Dwight: May I point out that the s*x appeared to be consensual? Both animals were smiling.",
        "Michael: OK...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: I grew up on a farm. I have seen animals having s*x in every position imaginable. Goat on chicken. Chicken on goat. Couple of chickens doin' a goat, couple of pigs watching. Whoever drew this got it exactly right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: What... can I do, for you?",
        "Barbara: I, for starters, I think that you should resign.",
        "Michael: Well... [exhales] OK, well... Um, wasn't really my fault. The guys at the papermill---",
        "Barbara: You're the head---",
        "Michael: The guys at the papermill--- No no no!",
        "Barbara: You're the head of the company!",
        "Michael: I'm the head of the company?!",
        "Barbara: Yes, and that makes it your responsibility---",
        "Michael: No, I'm a regional manager---",
        "Barbara: And so you should lose your job!",
        "Michael: No--- my--- OK, this is insane. You can get out of here. Get out!",
        "Barbara: Fine.",
        "Michael: That's insane. We'll give this to somebody who will appreciate it.",
        "Barbara: Mm-hmm.",
        "Dwight: It's non-transferable...",
        "Michael: Doesn't matter. Out please!",
        "Barbara: I'm calling the Better Business Bureau.",
        "Michael: Yeah, well I'm calling the Ungrateful Bi-atch Hotline! [to Chad Lite] Did you get all that?",
        "Chad Lite: Everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: We gotta do something. [exhales] This is spinning out of control, Pam. This is just, not...",
        "Pam: It's just the Scranton Times...",
        "Michael: No, then Newsweek picks it up. And then CNN does a story about it. Then... YouTube gets a hold of it...",
        "Pam: You know what? I really think the whole thing is just gonna blow over in like a week or two.",
        "Michael: You're right. It will blow over. But it's not... going to take... a week or two. [pulls out a video camcorder from his desk] Do you know what this is for?",
        "Pam: Yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos. He says he needs a woman's touch.",

        "Michael: \"Hello. I am Michael Scott, Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. By now you are probably sick of hearing about Dunder Mifflin and our embarrassing watermark boner. Let me tell you something. Something from the heart. I am not leaving this office. It will take a SWAT team, to remove me from this office, and maybe not even that.\"",
        "Dwight: Uh, you could never withstand a SWAT team.",
        "Michael: That's how devoted I am to this job.",
        "Dwight: I'm just saying...",
        "Michael: I know.",
        "Dwight: They would flank you. Throw in a concussion grenade.",
        "Michael: I understand that, Dwight.",
        "Dwight: You would be on the ground, blind, deaf, dumb.",
        "Michael: Do you think you're taking it a little... literally, Dwight? And now we're wasting tape. I'm gonna have to cut this all out. Can you say cut?",
        "Dwight: Cut.",
        "Michael: So I'll know where---",
        "Pam: Cut.",

Let's not forget who this whole resigning business is about, anyway. If I could leave you with one thought, remember... it wasn't me. They're trying to make me an escape goat.

        "Creed: I feel terrible about Debbie Brown. She got fired because of Dwight. So I thought I'd pass around a goodbye card, maybe everyone could put in a couple of bucks to help her through these difficult times. Why do bad things always happen to the good people? It's tragic. Just tragic.",
