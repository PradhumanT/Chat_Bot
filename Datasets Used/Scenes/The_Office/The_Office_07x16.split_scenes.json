        "Pam: Hey. How you doing?",
        "Darryl: Thinking about my grandmother a lot.",
        "Pam: Yeah.",
        "Darryl: She was about to turn 97.",
        "Pam: At least she lived a very long and I'm sure, a very happy life. Got you this card. When you're ready. We all signed it. We just wanted you to know we're thinking about you.",
        "Darryl: Thank you. \"Congratulations, Darryl. Let's get wasted.\" \"Have fun today, big guy.\" \"Aww, yeah. Party time. Whoo-whoop.\"",
        "Pam: It's possible that some people thought it was your birthday.",
        "Darryl: \"Hooray. Live it up big D. \" \"Days like this don't come often enough. Time to celebrate. You deserve this\"?",
        "Andy: Birthday punches! [softly punching Darryl in the stomach] One two three four five sice seven eight!",
        "Pam: I'm so sorry.",
        "Darryl: [tears welling up in his eyes]",
        "Andy: ...thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty-one twenty-two twenty-three twenty-four twenty-five twenty-six!...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: ...So I got an early res at Blue Wasabi and I'm taking Rachel. She's picking me up after work.",
        "Darryl: Rachel from the party?",
        "Andy: Oh, yeah!",
        "Darryl: Nice. Do the damn thing. - Pow! [they fist bump and explode]",
        "Phyllis: Blue Wasabi is so good, but get the cheeseburger. They say they won't do it, but they will if you make a scene.",
        "Holly: Okay, bye. Okay, bye. [kisses Michael] I'll miss you.",
        "Michael: Miss you. Okay. I'll be in my office if you need me.",
        "Holly: Bye.",
        "Michael: Okay, bye. Bye. All right, bye. Bye... bye.",
        "Holly: Okay, one more quick one.",
        "Michael: Don't go. I don't want you to go. Oh don't go. Don't go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Holly and I are dating. It's been a week, and I still can't believe it. [sighs] It goes to show that everything you want in life, you get. And you can't work for it. It just comes to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gabe: And what do we have here?",
        "Erin: From my secret admirer. That's you!",
        "Gabe: Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gabe: I dominate Valentine's Day. I practically make romance into a science.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Erin: \"Roses are red. Violets are blue. Look in the vase to find your first clue.\" Oh, my gosh. It's a romantic scavenger hunt!",
        "Gabe: Oh, close. It's a romantic treasure hunt. A scavenger hunt is where you find items from a master list. This is where you follow clues that lead to a prize. Common misuse. Good luck.",
        "Erin: But, there's no clue.",
        "Gabe: Well, get to work.",
        "Erin: I can't, 'cause there's no clue.",
        "Gabe: The puzzle is the clue.",
        "Erin: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oscar: [clears throat]",
        "Michael: [rubbing hands with Holly] Are these numbers correct?",
        "Oscar: The numbers are correct, Michael.",
        "Michael: Okay.",
        "Oscar: [clears throat more loudly]",
        "Michael: Are you... are you sick, Oscar? Do you need to go home? 'Cause you're grossing me out.",
        "Oscar: I jus... I just need a signature.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: [getting out of a taxi] There you go. Thanks.",
        "Pam: How much did you give him?",
        "Jim: Big tip.",
        "Pam: Wait. I don't have my scarf.",
        "Jim: What?",
        "Pam: I'm missing my scarf. Oh. [both laugh]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: We decided to have a Valentine's day lunch and then that way we can spend the entire night with Cece and avoid the Valentine's day dinner thing. It's a whole thing.",
        "Pam: [loudly] Yeah, lunch was wonderful!",
        "Jim: Shh.",
        "Pam: Um, there was an amazing buffet and there was a chocolate fondue... station. And what else was there?",
        "Jim: Um, bottomless champagne.",
        "Pam: Yes. Never found that bottom, did we?",
        "Jim: No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Erin: Psst! Psst!",
        "Andy: What's up?",
        "Erin: Are you good at jigsaw puzzles?",
        "Andy: Are you kidding me? It's all I did every summer when my brothers were out sailing.",
        "Erin: Okay.",
        "Andy: But if there is a romantic thing with Gabe, I should probably...",
        "Erin: Oh! No, no, no, no. It's not weird at all. You have your new girlfriend. I have Gabe. This is just as friends.",
        "Andy: Well, okay then.",
        "Erin: Yes!",
        "Andy: At least until Stanley calms down.",
        "Erin: Oh, is he...",
        "Andy: D...d...d...d...don't look. I accidentally did his Sudoku. [Stanley glares at Andy]",
        "Erin: Andy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: [on phone] All right, I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you. [chuckles]",
        "Dwight: Okay, my name is j...j...j...j...j...j...j...j Jim Halpert and I will fax it in to you... under you. I'll fax it under you. Oh, excuse me. I just p...p...p...p pissed my pants. Not really. I didn't really. [clears throat]",
        "Jim: [goes to hand Dwight a valentines card] Wait.",
        "Dwight: You're just filling that out right now. That wasn't meant for me. I will not be your Valentine.",
        "Jim: Aww, nuts. [laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Angela: I don't know if anyone else feels this way and don't get me wrong, I love Michael and Holly, and maybe I'm being overly sensitive, but... the PDA.",
        "Oscar: Yes! The freaking PDA!",
        "Angela: Uh-huh.",
        "Oscar: Thank you! I mean, I'm thrilled for them.",
        "Angela: No one is more thrilled for them than I am...",
        "Oscar: Yes, yes, absolutely.",
        "Angela: ...but it's totally inappropriate.",
        "Darryl: Yeah, it's a little much.",
        "Phyllis: Mm-hmm.",
        "Darryl: Obviously, so happy for them both.",
        "Oscar: So happy. Yeah.",
        "Kevin: I don't know, guys. I, for one, enjoy watching them, because...",
        "Angela: No, stop! Just don't.",
        "Oscar: Kevin!",
        "Kevin: Can I finish? Can I finish? Is that okay? I was saying...I enjoy watching them because it makes me horny.",
        "Everyone: [groans]",
        "Angela: God! Kevin!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Erin: So tell me about your new girlfriend.",
        "Andy: She's neat. Uh, I met her at Darryl's cousin's party. We were the only two white people there.",
        "Erin: Aww, cute.",
        "Andy: Hey, look at that. Done.",
        "Erin: That's Gabe's boom box. Come on. We have to go find it.",
        "Andy: I wish you well on your quest.",
        "Erin: No, come on.",
        "Andy: Aww, I mean...",
        "Erin: [growling] Come on!",
        "Andy: Okay.",
        "Erin: Ha!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gabe: [to Toby] I hear them kissing all the time. It's this horrible plipping sound. You know, it's like Chinese water torture. Just...[makes popping sound] like it's coming from my own head.",
        "Michael: Sit. Okay, just close your eyes. [massaging Holly's back]",
        "Holly: Ohh. Can you get lower?",
        "Michael: Oh, yeah.",
        "Holly: A little lower.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: I cannot keep myself from Michael. Everything he does is sexy. He has this undeniable animal magnetism. He's a jungle cat. The man exudes s*x. He can put both his legs behind his head.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gabe: Thank you all for meeting on such sort notice.",
        "Michael: [clears throat]",
        "Gabe: Yes?",
        "Michael: [sitting in Holly's lap] Yes. Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin. What is the purpose of this meeting?",
        "Gabe: Seeing as it's Valentine's Day, I felt it would be apropos to have a little refresher course on romance in the workplace.",
        "Michael: Perfect. Yes. It is quite apro-propriate. Carry on.",
        "Gabe: First things first. An office romance is permissible. Not something you'd expect to hear from corporate. Well, guess what. Sabre is 100% tolerant of office romances.",
        "Ryan: Speaking of, Gabe, I don't see Erin at this meeting.",
        "Meredith: Uh, I also don't see Andy.",
        "Kevin: Oooh.",
        "Jim: OOH! Boom! Face!",
        "Gabe: I get it. Andy's slamming my girlfriend. Very funny. What I do not approve of, however, is public displays of affection, or PDAs. PDAs are totally superfluous to a happy, healthy office romance. Perfect example. Look at Jim and Pam.",
        "Pam: Yeah. What? Us?",
        "Gabe: They don't touch. They don't kiss. You would hardly even know that they were husband and wife.",
        "Jim: Did it!",
        "Pam: Yeah!",
        "Jim: Love it. Keep it goin.",
        "Gabe: Okay. So, PDAs. That's gonna include behaviors such as hugging, kissing, uh...",
        "Kevin: Booby honking.",
        "Gabe: Yeah, booby honking. Sure.",
        "Kevin: Butt honking.",
        "Gabe: Butt honking. Yeah, all the honking.",
        "Creed: The one where you start in a crouches position, then you leap...",
        "Gabe: Sure. Basically, there's no precise definition, but you know it when you see it. Ahem.",
        "Oscar: Are you guys listening to this?",
        "Michael: What, are you talking about me and Holly?",
        "Pam: Yeah!",
        "Gabe: Maybe you find your own chair.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: So we kiss occasionally.",
        "Oscar: Not occasionally. All the time.",
        "Phyllis: Yeah, and it's not just the kissing. It's the flirtatious whispering.",
        "Stanley: The flirtatious tickling.",
        "Michael: Whispering and tickling have their place in business.",
        "Darryl: That thing were you softly exhale on her neck.",
        "Michael: I... Okay, yeah, that's pretty hot. I will give you that. Look, you are all hypocrites. You all do it.",
        "Dwight: Michael. Confession[/b]: I have done PDA in the office.",
        "Michael: Thank you.",
        "Dwight: I've had intercourse in the office.",
        "Michael: All right.",
        "Dwight: As has Angela!",
        "Angela: Dwight!",
        "Dwight: As has Ryan. As has Kelly. As has Meredith. As has Phyllis. As has Darryl. As has Creed. [Creed smiles and nods] As has Michael and as has Holly.",
        "Kevin: As has Kevin!",
        "Angela: With who?",
        "Kevin: She goes to another school.",
        "Michael: Okay. Fine. No more PDA.",
        "Oscar: Good.",
        "Michael: You win. But here's what we are going to do. We are going to designate one of our closets as a hook-up zone.",
        "Angela: No.",
        "Michael: Anything goes.",
        "Oscar: Just leave it how you said...",
        "Dwight: Michael, that's absurd. What if two couples want to go at the same time?",
        "Michael: Okay, then we have two closets. No, no, we're gonna have three closets, one for each base, no homers. Yes?",
        "Dwight: And what is the hook-up zone policy on masturbation?",
        "Michael: Pro.",
        "Dwight: Yes!",
        "Michael: What? Problem solved.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: No, no, it's great. I love working at Dunder Mifflin, a division of Taliban enterprises.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: That's weird. I mean, that's weird to have s*x in the office. That's where you work, right?",
        "Jim: Mm-hmm.",
        "Pam: You know, you're in a meeting, and nobody knows that you've had s*x there, except for you and him.",
        "Jim: [snorts] Ew.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Erin: Don't mind us. You keep working.",
        "Darryl: Okay. I'll keep working.",
        "Erin: Oh, my God. It's a song.",
        "Andy: Whoa.",
        "Erin: What do you think is on it?",
        "Andy: [softy] We should actually probably talk about it outside or we might make Darryl mad.",
        "Erin: [softly] Not if we're talking like this. I think it's okay. He doesn't seem to hear us.",
        "Andy: I think he can hear us.",
        "Andy: [softly] That makes sense, 'cause I feel like I'd be able to hear us at this level.",
        "Erin: Darryl.",
        "Andy: Darryl is a jerk.",
        "Erin: No, he's not.",
        "Andy: No, I'm just testing if he can hear.",
        "Darryl: I can hear you.",
        "Andy: Oh. Okay.",
        "Erin: Okay. Then no more talking. Let's just play the song.",
        "Boom Box: [Gabe singing] The temp at night. The temp at night. The temp at night. The temp at night.",
        "Andy: The temp at night?",
        "Erin: What do you...",
        "Darryl: You got it. Pick it up. Take it out.",
        "Andy: Pi...",
        "Darryl: Pick it up.",
        "Andy: Okay.",
        "Darryl: Take it out. Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up. Take it out.",
        "Andy: Right. Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: Sorry to interrupt. Forgot to collect my things.",
        "Michael: Ah, the old \"leave behind.\" Oldest trick in the book. Good thing it's working.",
        "Holly: Oh, no. Michael, I don't want to make people uncomfortable.",
        "Michael: Since when is comfort the most important thing? I mean, I don't... I don't sit on your lap because it's comfortable. I sit on your lap because I like the way your thighs feel on my butt.",
        "Holly: Yeah, but if they're uncomfortable, it makes me uncomfortable.",
        "Michael: Oh. Okay. Well, if it makes you uncomfortable, then we'll stop.",
        "Holly: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Holly and I are like Romeo and Juliet. And this office is like the dragon that kept them apart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Hey, you know why people here are complaining? They are jealous of two people in love on Valentine's Day.",
        "Holly: Two people in love?",
        "Michael: I love you.",
        "Holly: Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean you love me? We've only been dating for a week. Do you mean you love me like, \"oh, hey, there's Holly. I love that girl.\" Or you do you mean you love me like you love me-love me?",
        "Michael: I love you-love you.",
        "Holly: Wow, you love me-love me. I love you-love you. [both laugh]",
        "Michael: I am really disappointed in the office's policy on PDA at this moment. I love you. [shakes Holly's hand]",
        "Holly: I love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Yeah, whatever. No big deal. Just the hottest girl in the world loves me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: Okay, Ryan's the temp. What does he do at night?",
        "Erin: I guess we just have to wait until night and see.",
        "Andy: Oh, or maybe not. [turns out the lights]",
        "Erin: [gasps] Oh. Cool.",
        "Andy: How romantic is this?",
        "Erin: Super romantic.",
        "Andy: Right. Do you see a clue or...",
        "Erin: Yeah. Did you not see it? [\"Eat at Hanks\" is written in glow-in-the-dark letters above the door]",
        "Andy: Oh, my gosh.",
        "Erin: Hanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim and Pam: Hey!",
        "Andy and Erin: [bursting out of Ryan's closet] Hey.",
        "Andy: No time to chat.",
        "Erin: Sorry.",
        "Jim: Well, we were just looking for Ryan, so he's not here.",
        "Ryan: Hey. You're looking for me?",
        "Pam: Oh, yeah, we were. We were just looking to say hi. So hey.",
        "Ryan: No you weren't.",
        "Pam: No, we weren't.",
        "Ryan: You wanted to have s*x in my office.",
        "Pam: No.",
        "Jim: Definitely not. That's disgusting.",
        "Ryan: No. It's... it's cool. Just try to put everything back were you found it. Text me when you're finished. I'll be out here.",
        "Jim: Hey, you don't have to...",
        "Pam: That was so embarrassing. I'm gonna die.",
        "Jim: That was really rough.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Let me make something clear. Jim and I have never and will never have s*x in the office.",
        "Jim: No, because the office isn't what I'd consider a romantic place.",
        "Pam: Besides, we have something those other people don't have, which is a home and a bed.",
        "Jim: And a shower.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Hello, Holly.",
        "Holly: Hello.",
        "Michael: Here, shake. No!",
        "Holly: No, don't touch.",
        "Michael: No, we can't.",
        "Holly: No touching.",
        "Michael: No touching. Ah, I'm trying not to touch you.",
        "Holly: Oh.",
        "Michael: Oh.",
        "Holly: Almost got you.",
        "Michael: Oh, no, so close. Oh. No, we can't do that. We can't do this. Ohh.",
        "Holly: You're not touching me.",
        "Michael: I don't know what your body feels like 'cause I can't touch it.",
        "Oscar: Okay, this is much worse than before.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, I agree. This is nasty.",
        "Michael: Grab you here.",
        "Holly: And here.",
        "Michael: I will grab you here anyway. [laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gabe: You have to cut it out.",
        "Holly: Okay.",
        "Michael: Never.",
        "Holly: You said you would.",
        "Michael: I did say I would, but I was wrong. I can't stop. You don't what it is like to love a woman and have her love you back. It is a feeling that cannot and will not, and frankly, cannot be contained.",
        "Gabe: No one is a bigger fan of sexual touching than me. But with you two, it's reaching the level of a complex. I can think of three explanations. One[/b]: You're taking MDMA. Street name, ecstasy. I've done it, and I know the feeling.",
        "Holly: No, I don't think so.",
        "Gabe: Number two[/b]: You're desperately trying to fit in a whole relationship before Toby comes back from jury duty and Holly has to go back to Nashua. Or three[/b]: You're at an age where your sexual climaxes aren't as powerful so you need to overcompensate with foreplay, taboo behavior.",
        "Michael: Yes, it was that. It's that one.",
        "Holly: Yes. Number three.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: Give me all your money and take off your clothes.",
        "Michael: We're not supposed to PDA.",
        "Holly: Come one. Nobody's looking. What's wrong?",
        "Michael: I haven't thought about you having to go back to Nashua.",
        "Holly: Maybe we didn't want to think about it. We can make it work. We'll date long-distance.",
        "Michael: That's what we said last time. Remember? We broke up on the drive. How's this gonna be any different?",
        "Holly: We weren't in love last time.",
        "Michael: I was in love with you.",
        "Holly: I'm not saying it won't be hard. But we can make it work. That's what she said.",
        "Michael: [chuckles, sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Erin: Oh. One Erin Special, please.",
        "Hank: Here's your bottle of sparkling cider.",
        "Andy: Hey.",
        "Erin: [laughs] That's my favorite.",
        "Hank: I'm now supposed to tell you to enjoy a mind-hunt break and look for a heart or some [bleep] in the break room when you're through.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: [through the window at Michael] Hey, buck up, buddy!",
        "Darryl: Make that face he likes.",
        "Dwight: Hey. Hey. Come on. You're hurting him.",
        "Michael: It's like a time bomb...",
        "Dwight: Shh.",
        "Michael: ...is ticking down. When it goes off, no more kissing. No more hugging.",
        "Dwight: Just hush.",
        "Michael: Sexual time bomb.",
        "Dwight: Just rock. Shh.",
        "Michael: [into recorder] Boner Bomb starring Jason Statham. Or we go against type with an Eisenberg or a Michael Cera.",
        "Dwight: Movie idea?",
        "Michael: No. [into recorder] Saving the world has never been this hard.",
        "Dwight: Okay. Shh. Have you talked to her about your feelings? Women really go for that crap.",
        "Michael: No, I can't talk to her. I can't even look at her without thinking about it ending.",
        "Dwight: Kevin! Do more stupid faces.",
        "Kevin: Which one? I have a lot of stupid faces.",
        "Dwight: I don't know.",
        "Michael: Do the monkey face.",
        "Dwight: Do the monkey face!",
        "Michael: I love that. I love that face.",
