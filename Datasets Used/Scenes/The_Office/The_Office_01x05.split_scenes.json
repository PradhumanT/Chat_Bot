        "Michael and the office staff take on the workers in the warehouse in a basketball game. Through racist and sexist ideals, Michael chooses many of the lesser skilled office workers over their more athletic peers. Michael claims a \"flagrant personal intentional foul,\" stops the game, and declares his team as the winners. The warehouse finds the call unfair and Michael caves under pressure, and concedes the victory to the warehouse staff. Michael eventually tells the office that they don't have to come in on Saturday either, but it does little to calm them: \"Like coming in an extra day is going to prevent us from being downsized.\""

        "Michael: [to Jim] Hey, you ready?",
        "Michael: All right, all right, secret sign. Hey, Ryan. [Ryan holds up his bag] Very good. Excellent, excellent.",
        "Dwight: Michael!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Today at lunchtime we're going to be playing the warehouse staff at a friendly little game of basketball. My idea. Last time I was down there, I noticed they'd put up a couple of hoops, and I play basketball every weekend. So I thought, \"This might be kinda fun.\" And so I started messing around and... I'm sinking a few, you know. Swish, swish, swish. Nothing but net. And their jaws just dropped to the floor. African-Americans! So... you know, it's really just a good friendly game, a reason to get together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Pam, Pam, thank you ma'am. Messages, please. Thank you.",
        "Dwight: Michael, can I talk to you, please? Privately? In your office? I think I should be on the team.",
        "Michael: No. And that's not me being mean, Dwight. That is based on your past behavior.",
        "Dwight: Oh, please.",
        "Michael: [to camera] When I let him come to my pick-up game...",
        "Dwight: I apologized for that.",
        "Michael: [to Dwight] I vouched for you.",
        "Dwight: Michael, I...",
        "Michael: I vouched for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight. All right, here's what I'm going to do. The hand strikes and gives a flower. You are not going to play basketball. But I need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar.",
        "Dwight: I can handle that.",
        "Michael: Good. Excellent, it'll be fun. Because corporate, uh, wants someone to be here on Saturday. And so we're going to have to have some people come in on the weekend, and I know nobody's gonna want to do it and I know everybody's gonna complain and bitch and I don't want to have to deal with that.",
        "Dwight: And that's why you have an assistant regional manager.",
        "Michael: Yes it is. Assistant to the regional manager.",
        "Dwight: [to camera] Same thing.",
        "Michael: No, it's not. It's lower, so...",
        "Dwight: It's close.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: So we need someone to work this Saturday and I think that, that should be...Jim.",
        "Jim: God, this is so sad. This is the smallest amount of power I've ever seen go to someone's head. Phyllis, can you believe this?",
        "Phyllis: Keep me out of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: My fiance has plans for us this Saturday. So I really hope that Dwight doesn't make me work. Maybe I should sleep with him? I'm kidding, kidding. Totally kidding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: All right, managing by walking around. This is our warehouse. Or, as I like to call it, the whorehouse. But don't you call it that, I've earned the right.",
        "Ryan: Fine, don't worry about that.",
        "Michael: And here we have \"Mister Roger's Neighborhood.\" Come on over here. Hey, this is Ryan. He's temping upstairs.",
        "Lonny: What's up?",
        "Michael: And this is the foreman. Mista Ra-jahs.",
        "Darryl: It's not my real name.",
        "Michael: No, it's Darryl. Darryl is Mista Ra-jahs.",
        "Ryan: Darryl Rogers?",
        "Darryl: Darryl Philbin. Then Regis, then Rege, then Roger, then Mister Rogers.",
        "Michael: [laughs] And that is Lonny. And this is Roy. Roy dates Pam. You know, the uh, the best looking one upstairs.",
        "Ryan: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Michael: You still getting it regular man? Huh? I mean, I can tell her it's part of the job! Rapport!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: [on the phone] No, no, I know that the warranty's expired, but isn't it supposed to last longer than two years if it isn't defective? OK, fine, three years.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: Pam gets a little down. Her toaster oven broke. Um, which she got at her engagement shower. Um, for a wedding that still has yet to be set... and that was three years ago.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: So, um, one o'clock sharp and we've got a game on.",
        "Darryl: We're loading at one.",
        "Michael: Oh, I see, you're chickening out on me. You're bailing on me.",
        "Darryl: No, we got a truck going out at 1:15. So, that's the busy time.",
        "Michael: Oh, well, I'm glad that some time is a busy time because whenever I'm down here it doesn't seem too busy to me. Oh, oh. You can dish it out, but you can't take it. OK, fine, have it your way. [clucking and dancing like a chicken]",
        "Darryl: All right, fine, you know what? One o'clock.",
        "Michael: All right, see you at one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Are we ready for the game?",
        "Everybody: [half-heartedly] Yeah.",
        "Michael: I... yeah, yeah. I know, grumble, grumble. But you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way. Like that, uh, dwarf from Lord of the Rings.",
        "Dwight: Gimli.",
        "Michael: Nerd. That is why you're not on the team.",
        "Dwight: Just trying to be helpful.",
        "Michael: Uh, [in a nerdy voice] \"I'll help, Elwyn Dragonslayer, uh, ten points, power sword.\"",
        "Jim: That's him.",
        "Michael: OK, so, let's put together a starting line-up, shall we? Stanley of course.",
        "Stanley: I'm sorry?",
        "Michael: Um, what do you play? Center?",
        "Stanley: Why \"of course\"?",
        "Michael: Uh...",
        "Stanley: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Michael: Uh, I don't know. I don't remember saying that.",
        "Jim: Uh, I heard it.",
        "Michael: Well, people hear a lot of things, man. Um... other starters... Me, of course. I heard it that time.",
        "Phyllis: I'd like to play if it's just for fun. I played basketball in school.",
        "Michael: [ignores Phyllis)] Um... Yeah. Who else? We have Jim. We have Ryan, the new guy, right? Untested. Willing to prove himself now. A lot of passion, a lot of heart.",
        "Ryan: But, I'm getting paid to skip lunch?",
        "Michael: Yes.",
        "Ryan: OK.",
        "Michael: Yes, this is business. The, uh, business of team building and morale boosting. Uh, who else?",
        "Oscar: I can help out, if you need me.",
        "Michael: I will use your talents come baseball season, my friend. Or if we box.",
        "Kevin: I have a hoop in my driveway.",
        "Michael: No.",
        "Phyllis: I have a sports bra.",
        "Michael: No, no, ridiculous.",
        "Dwight: Michael, look. [Dwight throws paper at the garbage can] Missed it...",
        "Michael: Close. All right, uh... Me, Stan the man, Jim, Ryan and Dwight.",
        "Dwight: Yes!",
        "Michael: Sorry Phyllis.",
        "Dwight: Can I be team captain?",
        "Michael: No, I'm team captain.",
        "Dwight: Can I be team manager?",
        "Michael: No, I am the team manager. You can be assistant to the team manager.",
        "Dwight: Assistant team manager?",
        "Michael: No.",
        "Dwight: OK, we'll see who's working this weekend then.",
        "Michael: Jim, you're in charge of the vacation schedule now.",
        "Jim: Oh my God.",
        "Michael: Threat neutralized.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: [hits Pam in the head with a piece of paper] Off the backboard!",
        "Pam: Please don't throw garbage at me.",
        "Michael: Oh, Pam with a zinger. Hey, Pam, how would you, like to be our cheerleader today? You know, some, ah, pigtails? A little, ah, halter top, you could tie that up. And you know, something a little, just, youthful, for a change. Just this once?",
        "Pam: I don't think so Michael. Besides, I can't cheer against my fiance.",
        "Jim: I'll do it. Wear a little flouncey skirt if you want, and...",
        "Michael: Yeah, I bet you would. Just try not to be too gay on the court. And by gay I mean, um, you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way. I think that goes without saying.",
        "Pam: Maybe Angela would cheerlead.",
        "Michael: Oh, yeah right.",
        "Phyllis: I'll do it.",
        "Michael: Oh, yuck, that's worse than you playing. ... 'Cause we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt. That's where we need you. Blessed be those who sit and wait. You made it, suit up, you're on the team! All right, cool! Very good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Oh-oh. Oh-oh. A spy from the warehouse. Trying to figure out our plays, huh, man?",
        "Darryl: Just getting a tea bag.",
        "Michael: Oh ho, oh, he's running. He's running. He's running, but he can't hide because you know what? One o'clock, you better bring your 'A' game. Because me, and my, posse guys are gonna be in your face. Right in your face!",
        "Darryl: Why don't we make it more interesting? Loser buys dinner at Farley's.",
        "Michael: Whoa-ho. I like the way you think. You know what, I'm gonna take that one step further. Loser, works, on Saturday.",
        "Darryl: No, that's not as much fun. You know what?",
        "Michael: What?",
        "Darryl: You're on.",
        "Michael: OK. Cool, you're on. [to Dwight] Don't screw this up.",

        "Jim: Whoa.",
        "Jim: Is that trash talk from Pam?",

        "Jim: Oh.",
        "Pam: And he wants to take the WaveRunners to the lake this Saturday so...",
        "Jim: Well, I'm going to the outlet mall on Saturday, so if you wanna save big on brand names and Roy has to work, which he will, because I'm also competitive, you should feel free to come along.",
        "Pam: Um, I think I'm gonna be up at the lake.",
        "Jim: I think I'll see you at the mall. Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Hey, there he is! Secret weapon! All right, guys, come on, let's bring it in! Here we go! OK, listen, this is just going to be a friendly game, right?

        "Jim: Really? I thought I'd take Roy.",
        "Michael: Actually, I think Roy is their best player not Lonny. So, Dwight, you uh, have the East German gal. Uh, who else we got... Um...OK, all right, you guys.",
        "Dwight: [taking off his shirt] OK, we'll be skins!",
        "Michael: Aw, come on Dwight.",
        "Dwight: What? Shirts on or off?",
        "Michael: On. Just put it on.",
        "Dwight: You sure?",
        "Michael: Yes. Uh, Pam? You kind of have your foot in both camps, why don't you do the uh, jump ball OK?",
        "Roy: Don't listen to him Pam. Trust me, tip it my way or you're sleeping in the car.",
        "Michael: Stanley! What? You gotta be kidding me! !?! [Roy steals the ball, and goes for a lay up] Oh... Here we go! [Lonny shoots and makes it] Who's on him? Somebody get him!",

        "Darryl: Take your shot man!",
        "Michael: No, no, no, no. That was a flagrant, personal, intentional foul. Right there.",
        "Worker: No it wasn't.",
        "Michael: [mocking voice] Yes, it was. You know what, I'm just being fair.",
        "Worker: Oh, really? No, I just put my arm up...",
        "Michael: Game over. Game over. That is it! I'm sorry, you know? I hate to do it this way but, you know, that's just... we're having a friendly game. It's a shame. This is a damn shame, but we're like a family here and that just, that won't fly.",

        "Lonny: Monday?",
        "Michael: [laughing] You guys believed me? Come on. Dogs, you know, you should know me better than that. No, oh, do you think that would've been good for morale? No. No. No. Exactly, no. I'm embarrassed it was even that close though. So... nah, of course, we're coming in Saturday. Good game. Word.",

        "Michael: Come on. Let's not be gloomy here man. We're all in this together. We're a team. You know what? Screw corporate, nobody's coming in tomorrow. You have the day off. Like coming in an extra day is gonna prevent us from being downsized. Have a good weekend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: The great thing about sports is that it is all about character. And you can learn lessons about life even if you don't win. But we did because we were ahead."
