    "Recap": [
        "Due to Dunder Mifflin Stamford closing, six members of the staff (Jim, Karen, Andy, Martin, Tony, and Hannah) move to and take jobs in Scranton. Michael attempts to welcome his new employees, but naturally ends up alienating and offending them; eventually he accidentally humiliates Tony, who announces that he is quitting. Michael becomes defensive, and fires him instead. Andy begins sucking up to Michael, causing Dwight to become jealous. Excited that he is back, Pam tries getting her old friendship back with Jim, but things get weird when she asks him out for coffee to catch up, but he turns her down, revealing that he has begun dating Karen."

        "Jim: The Stamford branch is closing and everybody's just packing up their stuff. Andy Bernard made these tasteful hats.",

        "Andy: [to office worker] That's the other thing you got to watch out... [to Jim] Yo! Tuna! I wanna talk to you about this new boss, Michael Scott.",
        "Jim: Yeah.",
        "Andy: So what's he like? Likes? Dislikes? Favorite sports? Favorite movies? Favorite men's magazines?",
        "Jim: You know what? I think you just need to meet him.",
        "Andy: Playing your cards close to the vest. I get it. Good luck over there, Tuna. Cross me and I will destroy you.",
        "Jim: Sounds good Andy.",
        "Karen: This is going to be an adventure.",
        "Jim: Yes. This is going to be very interesting. All right, I'm out of here. See you later?",
        "Karen: Right on. [to Andy] Hey is that Josh's computer?",
        "Andy: What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Hey!",
        "Toby: Hey.",
        "Pam: How'd the run go?",
        "Toby: Ah, pretty good. I finished.",
        "Pam: That's great!",
        "Dwight: Psh, why is that great?",
        "Pam: Because he accomplished something.",
        "Dwight: What was your mile time?",
        "Toby: About seven.",
        "Dwight: [scoffs] I could beat that on a skateboard.",
        "Toby: Well, that has wheels.",
        "Dwight: Yeah, well my feet don't. And I can still crush that time.",
        "Pam: Really, Dwight? How fast are you?",
        "Dwight: Let's just put it this way. Last weekend I outran a black pepper snake.",
        "Pam: Really?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: I am fast. To give you a reference point. I'm somewhere between a snake and a mongoose. And a panther.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: Man, what is taking Toby so long?",
        "Pam: Oh, I'll just time him later.",
        "Dwight: And you'll compare the times?",
        "Pam: Yeah. Are you ready?",
        "Dwight: No, my groin...",
        "Pam: Set",
        "Dwight: ...is really tight.",
        "Pam: Go!",
        "Dwight: I can't... [starts running]",
        "Pam: Am I being mean to Dwight? I don't know. I did just make him run around the building and I have no intention of timing him. This isn't even a stopwatch. It's a digital thermometer. He does make my life harder, sometimes. And on purpose. Like he tried to put meters on the bathroom stalls as a way of bringing in more money for the company. [yells to Dwight] Hey, three more laps to go. Gotta pick it up if you're going to beat Toby.",
        "Dwight: Aaaaah!",
        "Pam: I should probably get back to work.",

        "Michael: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: My branch is absorbing the Stamford branch. Or, as I like to put it, my family is doubling in size. That's all I'm going to say about it because I have a gigantic performance ahead of me. And I have to get into my head and focus. [exhales]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Who's next?",
        "Dwight: That's Andy Bernard.",

        "Michael: What?",
        "Dwight: ...before noon...",
        "Michael: I'm not...",
        "Dwight: ...to consolidate power.",
        "Michael: I'm not firing somebody on the first day.",
        "Dwight: No, no, no! Not somebody. Gardner.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: The Japanese camp guards of World War II always chose one man to kill whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived. I always wondered how they chose the man who was to die. I think I would have been good at choosing the person.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Good morning!",
        "Michael: Got the food? Good! Looky-looky-looky. What I want you to do... set it up in the conference room, please. Make it look nice. As if you are trying to impress a much older man who's way out of your league.",
        "Pam: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Yes! I'm in a good mood today! I'm excited to meet all the new people and to see my old friend again, definitely. That's always a thing that makes people happy... to have an old friend back.",

        "Hannah: Hello?",
        "Michael: Ah! Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding. Our first arrival. Welcome to Scranton. This is Hannah Smoterich-Barr.",
        "Dwight: Hannah Smoterich-Barr.",
        "Michael: Welcome to our humble abode. Follow me to your desk. Your ball and chain is right over here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: You know for a lot of these people this is the only family they have. So... As far as I'm concerned, [holds up WORLD'S BEST BOSS mug] this says 'World's Best Dad'.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Ah! There he is Tony... what's your last name?",
        "Tony: Gardner.",
        "Michael: Gardner! I knew that. There you go. Gift bag... for you. [laughs] Okay.",
        "Tony: Thanks.",
        "Kevin: Michael, I didn't get a gift bag.",
        "Michael: Well, they're just for guests. If there are any left over, you can buy one later.",
        "Hannah: My bag's mostly pencils.",
        "Michael: Wh..and coupons... to various hot spots around Scranton. [to Tony] All right! Let me show you to your area, sir. Come on, big guy.",
        "Kevin: Can I have your pencils?",

        "Michael: Welcome, welcome, welcome! [in robot voice] Take me to your leader. Oh wait, I am your leader.",
        "Karen: Uh wait, are you a robot or a Martian?",
        "Michael: Mmm... dah. I am actually your boss, Michael Scott. Welcome. Wow! You are very exotic looking. Was your dad a G.I. or uh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: I'll be the Number Two guy here in Scranton in six weeks. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake. I'm always thinking one step ahead. Like a carpenter that makes stairs.",

        "Jim: Okay.",
        "Michael: [to Martin] How are you? Martin Nash, I presume? This is a little gift bag for you.",
        "Martin: Oh! Thanks.",

        "Kevin: Oh, yes I can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: In general, they do not give me much responsibility. But they do let me shred the company documents. And that is really all I need.",

        "Michael: Not now.",
        "Dwight: Which is higher? Assistant Regional Manager or Regional Director in Charge of Sales?",
        "Michael: I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale.",
        "Dwight: Okay. So who gets paid more? Me or Andy?",
        "Michael: It is not a matter of more or less. Your pay is just different. Okay? All right! Show time, part one.",
        "Dwight: Ok. Who reports to who?",
        "Michael: I don't care! Dwight! You all report to me! That's all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok?",
        "Dwight: And then if I want...",
        "Michael: Work it out amongst your selves!",
        "Dwight: I...",

        "Kelly: Looks like salmon.",
        "Michael: Nope. Um... for the guests it is. For you, consider it cow-meat. Strictly taboo.",
        "Kelly: I eat beef.",
        "Michael: Well, then... consider it poisoned beef. No touchy.",
        "Kevin: The beef is poisoned?",

        "Toby: Um... You might want these orientation materials.",
        "Michael: Wrong. Toby, this is an orientation not a borientation.[talks to group] Okay. Do not worry. All of your questions are about to be answered. Cell phones and pagers off, please.",
        "Jim: Oh, this looks promising.",
        "Pam: You won't be disappointed.",
        "Michael: Let's face it. Moving to a new job can be very stressful. So I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But it's not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. It's funny. It's got a little bit of a zing to it and I hope that it gives you a flavor of what we're all about here at Dunder Mifflin. And what we're all about here in Scranton. So let's just all laugh together and watch \"Lazy Scranton\".",
