        "Dwight: Gotta clear out these file cabinets people, a lot of these are dead accounts. \"Scranton Mimeograph Corp?\" I don't think we're doing business with them any time soon. That's odd.

        "Dwight: Pfft, \"Athlead\"? Please. They're too lazy to call it Athletes Lead? Jim should just call it \"Stumpany,\" for \"Stupid Company.\"",

        "Darryl: Yeah, just weekends for now, but pretty soon, I'm switching over.",

        "Darryl: Yep.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: [on phone] Hey, Halpert, what's the big idea? First you jump ship. Now you're stealing Darryl too. When will it end?",

        "Jim: I am still in Philly, actually.",
        "Pam: What?",
        "Jim: It's insane. This huge investor got cold feet, so I'm stuck here trying to keep him on board.",
        "Pam: Hon, I wish you would have told me an hour ago, when you knew you weren't gonna make it.",
        "Jim: Pam, I couldn't get out. I barely made it out just to make this phone call.",
        "Cece: I want Daddy.",
        "Jim: You're gonna do great. And you know what? Mommy's gonna record it. So we'll watch it together. Do you mind doing that, Pam?",

        "Oscar: \"Loyalty pledge\"?",
        "Darryl: Come on, Dwight, stop overreacting. I'm getting all my work done here. No customers have complained. Nobody even knows.",
        "Dwight: Yeah, we'll see about that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: Bust out your complaint files. I need everything you've got on Darryl since he started working for Jim in the last few weeks. Break it down by keyword, okay? \"Infuriating, irresponsible\"...",
        "Clark: They got us set up with Windows 95, so you're kind of dreaming here.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: [writing on white board] Customer Loyalty. What is it? Can you hold it in your hand? Can you nudge it with your finger? Can you dump it on a woman? No. Why? Because it's an idea. But what does it mean?",
        "Kevin: Ooh, it's when you get a free sandwich after you've already eaten ten sandwiches.",
        "Dwight: Not even close. Mr. Romanko has been a client for 20 years. He came in today in a rage. Why? Because of Darryl. Because Darryl was focusing on outside projects and needs to remember his first priority-- the client.",
        "Mr. Romanko: I wouldn't say a rage.",
        "Darryl: Mr. Romanko, we were a day late on one of your deliveries, but two of our trucks were down for repairs. It's very unlikely it would happen again.",
        "Mr. Romanko: Thank you. Thank you.",
        "Dwight: No, you're not going anywhere, okay? You are angry, and we are gonna hear you out, all right? Because business is about relationships, and the key to relationships is what, Darryl? L--",
        "Darryl: Loyalty.",
        "Dwight: Loyalty.",
        "Nellie: Loyalty is exactly right.",
        "Dwight: Thank you.",
        "Nellie: Yes. I mean, it is everything. Let's all ask ourselves, have we been faithful in our relationships?",
        "Stanley: That's none of your damn business.",
        "Nellie: Darryl is \"dating\" Dunder Mifflin.",
        "Darryl: Darryl is dating Val... still.",
        "Nellie: But he's flirting with Jim's company on the side. And we all know what flirting can lead to.",
        "Mr. Romanko: I'm sorry. Do I still need to be here?",
        "Dwight: Yes.",
        "Nellie: I'm having a bit of trouble understanding the importance of loyalty. So let's-- let's use an example. Take Erin. Erin's boyfriend Andy, is away across the ocean.",
        "Dwight: Yeah.",
        "Nellie: So is it all right for her to flirt with Creed, for example?",
        "Creed: Let's try it out.",
        "Nellie: No, let's-- let's-- let's not say Creed. Let's say Mr. X.",
        "Angela: Well, I think it would be immoral for Erin to cheat on Andy.",
        "Erin: Oh, I'm sorry. Didn't you cheat on Andy?",
        "Angela: Yes. And he didn't like it.",
        "Phyllis: Does Mr. X know that Erin has a boyfriend, or did Erin keep that from Mr. X?",
        "Kevin: Okay, this is really hard to follow. Can we just say Pete because that's the guy that Erin's flirting with?",

        "Audience: Shh!",
        "Pam: [whispering] Um, I'm sorry. I have to go. My daughter's a ladybug. I know that doesn't make any sense. Um, thank you, thank you.",

        "Parent in audience #1: Yes, very rude.",
        "Pam: Shh! Kids are dancing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: Thank you so much for coming. Darryl and I will be here to serve you for years and years and years and years. [chuckles] So, should we go call Jim and tell him to go screw himself?",
        "Darryl: Dwight, look, I'm sorry you're having a hard time with this, okay? Athlead is my future. No disrespect to Dunder Mifflin, but if I can have fun at work, I want that.",
        "Dwight: It can't be more fun than selling paper and paper products.",
        "Darryl: It can.",
        "Dwight: Are you pretending to be crazy, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phyllis: Well, Andy's cute, but he's too vanilla, whereas Pete - he's just one sick dude. I mean, you know this guy likes to get weird.",
        "Erin: I'm just gonna say this one more time. Pete and I haven't done anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meredith: Yeah right. With slammin' bods like that, they ain't playing checkers.",
        "Oscar: People, it's 2013. Erin is a strong, independent woman. Who says she has to end up with any man?",
        "Erin: Okay, can everyone please stop speaking for me? Andy is my boyfriend. Pete and I are just friends. And that's the end of it. Right, Pete?",
        "Pete: That is correct. Come on, guys, where is this even coming from?",
        "Kevin: Your feelings for Erin? Probably your heart... and a little bit your pen1s.",
        "All: [groan]",
        "Erin: Nellie, you have to shut down the task force. I'm not sure if you need to start a new task force to do that, but please just shut down the task force.",
        "Nellie: I suppose that will-- that will be all right, yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nellie: Most relationships eventually die on their own, but sometimes they just need a little pillow over the face. You're welcome, Andy. And you're welcome, my own ass.",

        "Investor: Listen, I appreciate you taking the time with me.",
        "Co-worker: Peter, please. We completely understand your concerns here. Let us just show you the latest projections. Jim?",
        "Jim: Uh, Wade actually has those on the road, but he's gonna be calling in with those numbers any second. So just hold on one s--",
        "[cell phone vibrates]",
        "Jim: Oh, actually... uh, nope. That is my wife. Again, he'll be calling in any second.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: [on phone] Hey, uh, give me a call back when you get a chance. Cece did great, and I want to tell you something.",

        "Lonnie: Hey boss, you gotta jump on a delivery.",
        "Darryl: I don't do that anymore.",
        "Lonnie: That's what they told me.",
        "Darryl: [sighs]",

        "Dwight: Uh, not far at all, but I thought along the way, we could play some sports. [throws small ball at Darryl]",

        "Nellie: Oh, I don't know. Okay.",
        "Toby: I'm just curious though, what do you have against Pete and Erin?",
        "Nellie: Well, Andy wrote me a really nice recommendation letter for the adoption agency, and I-- I just sort of felt I owed him one.",
        "Toby: Pete's a pretty cool guy, though, and Andy was a terrible lover to Erin. He basically ignored her and left on a boat.",
        "Nellie: I didn't really think about it like that.",
        "Toby: Yeah, well... Not everybody has what we have.",
        "Nellie: \"What we have\"?",

        "Darryl: Exactly like this.",
        "Fast Food Worker: And your milkshake.",
        "Dwight: Thank you.",
        "Darryl: It's 30 degrees out. You drinkin' a mildshake?",
        "Dwight: Nope. [throwing milkshake] Fire in the hole! [laughs] Oh, yeah! Now that's what working at a paper company's all about!",
        "[Darryl take keys out of ignition]",
        "Dwight: Wait, what you doing? No, I need the k-- We have to go.",
        "Darryl: You just threw a milkshake in a restaurant where they make minimum wage.",

        "Pam: Wait. What?",
        "Pam: [recorded on phone] Excuse me, I have to get back to work.",
        "Pam: Oh, no. I took a phone call in the middle of taping, and then when I went to turn it back on, I must have turned it off.",
        "Oscar: User error. I've heard of that happening to other people.",
        "Angela: Oscar, don't rub it in. I'm sure Pam is already kicking herself for choosing a phone call over her child.",
        "Pam: Well, it was an important phone call.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: I haven't told anyone here about the mural yet. I want Jim to be the first to know. Whenever I tell him good news, he's always like, \"Beesly!\" I love that. Only thing better than getting the job-- \"Beesly!\" [chuckles]",

        "Nellie: I am sorry that was so awkward for you two in that meeting. But I am going to have to reassemble the youth task force.",
        "Erin: Oh, no, I really don't think that's a good idea.",
        "Nellie: Well, that is not your call. I made the decision. You have no choice in the matter, and everybody knows it.",
        "Pete: Well, okay, then.",
        "Erin: I guess we don't have a choice.",
        "Nellie: Nope.",

        "Jim: Hey.",
        "Pam: So, how's it going?",
        "Jim: We lost Bridgeport Capital. I have no idea what happened. It's like everything I did, he just wouldn't go for it.",
        "Pam: I'm so sorry.",
        "Jim: I have no idea where we're gonna come up with this money, and we have to work insanely hard over the next few weeks.",
        "Pam: [sighs] Oh, I'm sorry. I feel like you've already been working insanely hard.",
        "Jim: Can you figure out how to upload Cece's dance recital? I definitely could use a pick-me-up.",
        "Pam: Um, actually, funny story -- I didn't get it. I shouldn't have been so cocky about my rectangle-holding skills after all.",
        "Jim: You're not serious, are you? You didn't get any of the recital?",
        "Pam: No, I got the teacher introducing them and then the applause afterwards. But not so much of the middle part.",
        "Jim: Come on, Pam. Pam, I asked you if you could use the phone, and you swore that you knew how.",
        "Pam: Yeah, okay, I'm sorry. I'm sure we can get a copy. A lot of people were taping it.",
