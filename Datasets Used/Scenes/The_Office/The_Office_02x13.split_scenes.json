        "Michael: That's exactly what I was thinking.",
        "Dwight: Question? May I investigate?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Michael: Jim and I are great friends. We hang out a ton, mostly at work. But, the fact that he told me his secret and no one else knows says everything about our friendship. And it is why, I intend on keeping that secret for as long as I possibly can.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: There are several different ways to tell if a perp is lying. The liar will avoid direct eye contact. The liar will cover part of his or her face with his hands, especially the mouth. The liar will perspire. Unfortunately I spoke to Oscar on the phone so none of this is useful.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: It's Grrrrrrape! Soda.",
        "Jim: Tony the tiger. You don't hear that much any more.",

        "Dwight: Ok, what is going on here?",
        "Michael: Nothing.",
        "Dwight: Oh, really nothing? Fact: You are drinking grape soda. You never drink grape soda. Fact: You are talking to Jim. You never talk to Jim.",

        "Dwight: Ok. So what is the secret Michael?",
        "Jim: Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material.",
        "Dwight: Is that true?",
        "Michael: Um, I don't know, yeah, yeah, yeah it is.",
        "Dwight: Thank you Michael. I know your telling the truth.",
        "Michael: Ok.",
        "Dwight: I can tell. I won't let you down.",
        "Michael: Good.",
        "Jim: Thanks.",
        "Michael: Whooo, nice. That was, that was slick. What are you doin' for lunch?",
        "Jim: I don't know probably just gonna eat my ham and cheese sandwich in the break room.",
        "Michael: Oh nonsense [lifts leg and puts it on Jim's desk], no way, no. Why don't, why don't I take you out to lunch? My treat.",
        "Jim: No, that's alright, thank you though. It's, I, gotta do some cleaning, should probably stick around here.",
        "Michael: Hey you know what we could do? We could spread out a blanket in the break room. Have a little picnic order some 'za. Talk about you know who.",
        "Jim: Oh, ah, no but no. You know what let's go out. That was a good idea. Let's go out.",

        "Dana: Hey I'm Dana. Welcome to Hooters.",
        "Michael: We're not worthy. We're not worthy. Hello Dana, I am Michael and this is Jim and we are brothers.",
        "Jim: Nope we're not brothers.",
        "Michael: I'm his boss actually. And I treat him well. I'm taking him out to lunch cause I can afford it and he can have whatever he wants.",
        "Jim: Can I just have the ham and cheese sandwich, thanks.",
        "Dana: And for you?",
        "Michael: Tell me Dana, how is your chicken breast?",
        "Dana: Oh, it's great. It's served with our world famous wing sauce.",

        "Dwight: Sniffling how?",
        "Pam: Umm. How many different ways are there to sniffle?",
        "Dwight: Three.",
        "Pam: Ok, it was the second one.",

        "Michael: What do you like best about Pam?",
        "Jim: Uh, I really don't want to talk about it.",
        "Michael: Is it her boobs, or...",
        "Jim: Um, she's easy to talk to I guess and she's got a really good sense of humor.",
        "Michael: Really?",
        "Jim: Uh-huh.",
        "Michael: Never get's any of my jokes.",
        "Jim: What about you?",

        "Michael: Ohhh happy birthday Jim!",
        "Dana: Ready girls? Front side.",
        "Hooter's Girls: You put your front side in; you put your front side out. You put your front side in and shake it all about. You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around. That's what it's all about. Whoo, hoo!",
        "Jim: Thank you.",
        "Michael: Woo! Yeah!",
        "Jim: Thanks, thanks Dana.",

        "Pam: I hate you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: Quick Oscar update. I have conducted interviews with everyone in the office.",
        "Michael: Just go to his house and see if he's sick. I could have done this Investigation in like twenty minutes.",
        "Dwight: Including prep time?",
        "Michael: Just do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ryan: If I had to I could clean out my desk in five seconds and nobody would ever know I had ever been here. And I'd forget too.",

        "Michael: No he did not. I don't need his permission.",
        "Toby: You just got your corporate credit card back. Do you really want me to take it away again?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Uhhh it's ridiculous. They took my card away because I spent $80 bucks at a magic shop. What they don't understand is that I bought the stuff to impress potential clients. So business related, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: I put a cigarette through a freakin' quarter. And you know what Toby? They almost bought from us.",
        "Toby: I'm not processing this.",
        "Michael: Look Jim needed a relaxing lunch, he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity. How is that not work related?",
        "Toby: He seems fine to me.",
        "Michael: You're not his friend, you don't know. He is in love with a girl he works with who's engaged. So just cut me some slack. Please?",
        "Kelly: Pam?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phylis: Angela who would you choose Jim or Roy?",

        "Creed: Oh ho! Which one is Pam?",
        "Kevin: Well she's the... Hey Michael so do you think Jim will try to break up the wedding?",
        "Michael: You know what Kevin? Jim is a friend of mine, so the only people that this crush really concerns is Jim and Pam... and me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: As a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy I have been doing surveillance for years. One time I suspected an ex-girlfriend of mine of cheating on me. So I tailed her for six straight nights. Turns out she was, with a couple of guys actually so... mystery solved.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Jim, why didn't you tell me you had a crush on Pam?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: Well the cats out of the bag. I used to have a crush on Pam and now I [hesitate] don't. Riveting.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Pam: Score.",
        "Jim: It expired in August, and my cell phone charger from two years ago.",
        "Pam: Big day.",
        "Jim: Big day.",
        "Jim: Hey oh, listen, um, I told Michael on the booze cruise. It's so stupid. Um, I told Michael that I had had a crush on you when you first started here.",
        "Pam: Oh.",
        "Jim: Well I thought that, I figured you should hear it from me rather than, I mean you know Michael.",
        "Pam: Right.",
        "Jim: And seriously, it's totally not a big deal, ok? And when I found out you were engaged, I mean.",
        "Pam: No, I know, like, I kind of like, I thought that maybe you did when I first started.",
        "Jim: Oh you did?",
        "Pam: No, I mean, just 'cause we like got along so well.",
        "Jim: No, no, you saw through me, great.",
        "Pam: So are you going to be like totally awkward around me now?",
        "Jim: Oh yeah, yeah... hope that's okay.",
        "Pam: Mmm, hmm.",
        "Jim: And Pam it was like three years ago so I am totally over it.",

        "Dwight: Stay low... This is it... There he is. He's been gone for at least two hours. Who is that? Come to Papa... Oh yes. Let's roll. I knew it! You are so busted. Ice skates, shopping bags? I think I know what's going on here. You weren't sick at all.",
        "Gil: Who's this?",
        "Dwight: This is Dwight Schrute. Who is this?",
        "Gil: Gil.",
        "Oscar: Are you going to tell Michael?",
        "Dwight: How bout this. I don't tell Michael and in exchange you owe me one great big giant favor. Redeemable by me at a time and place of my choosing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: Guess what I found out about Oscar tonight? He was lying about being sick. Should I have reported Oscar's malfeasance. Hmm, probably, but now I know something he doesn't want me to know. So I can use his malfeasance to establish leverage. Otherwise, it's just malfeasance for malfeasanceses-ses sake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: Hey.",
        "Michael: I know, I know, I know.",
        "Jim: Umm, what happened?",
        "Michael: I, oh, just, um, I know I was trying to, expense reports. And then God, Toby, you know he just... I know. I'm just, I just hope that, I just hope that [starts to get choked up] this doesn't affect our friendship! Stupid, this is so stupid.",
        "Jim: Hey, hey, wow, wow. Listen man it's, you know what. It's not a big deal.",
        "Michael: Ok, I'm fine, no I know, I'm good, I'm good, it's just.",

        "Michael: No, I feel it's my responsibility as your boss slash friend.",
        "Pam: No, really, it's okay. I know that Jim had, like a crush on me when he first started. But that was a long time ago, so.",
        "Michael: It wasn't that long ago. It was on the booze cruise.",
        "Pam: Jim had a crush on me on the booze cruise or he told you about it on the booze cruise?",

        "Michael: People are always coming to me. \"Michael, I have a secret. Your the only one I trust.\" No thanks, because keeping a secret can only lead to trouble. Like I was watching Cinemax last weekend. This movie, Portrait of a... Prostitute something. Secrets of a Call... More Secrets of a Call Girl. And the lead character, Shila, is framed for murder. She goes on the run and winds up working at a bordello in Malibu. I don't, I don't want to live like that. I like it here. I don't want to be Shila, I like being Michael Scott."

Like I was watching Cinemax last weekend. This movie, Portrait of a... Prostitute something. Secrets of a Call... More Secrets of a Call Girl. And the lead character, Shila, is framed for murder. She goes on the run and winds up working at a bordello in Malibu. I don't, I don't want to live like that. I like it here. I don't want to be Shila, I like being Michael Scott."
