        "Dwight: The documentary series finished airing ages ago. Why is PBS sending another crew?",
        "Camera Man: We're getting bonus footage for the DVD.",
        "Dwight: pff, Nobody buys DVDs anymore.",
        "Camera Man: It'll be a pledge gift.",
        "Dwight: PBS. The propaganda wing of Bill and Melinda Gates and viewers like you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: In the past year, I have consolidated the entire Scranton paper market. We regained the white pages, the school district, Lackawanna county. We supply them all. I'm getting married tomorrow afternoon, and in the morning, there's a mini-reunion. A kind of a \"where are they now\" panel at a local theatre. It'll be nice to see everyone again. [laughs] I haven't seen Kevin since we let him go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: [mimicking trumpet] Today marks several important milestones. Stanley, as you know, is retiring.",
        "Kevin: Yes! Whoo, whoo, whoo!",
        "Stanley: Ah, I've been looking forward to this day since I was 18 years old.",
        "Meredith: Speech!",
        "Dwight: No! And our next and most thickly frosted cake is...for...Kevin.",
        "Kevin: Yes! Wait, why?",
        "Dwight: Go ahead and just read the frosting.",
        "Kevin: \"Get out.\"",
        "Dwight: Uh-huh.",
        "Kevin: What does that mean?",
        "Dwight: It's a colloquial way of saying \"you're fired,\" Kevin, which you are.",
        "Pam: What? Dwight, you can't do that.",
        "Dwight: The cake has spoken Pam. Sorry.",
        "All: What?!",
        "Dwight: Well if anyone here can make a case for Kevin staying.",
        "All: Dwight...[overlapping objections]",
        "Dwight: Based...on his merit.",
        "Oscar: Ooh.",
        "Jim: Umm....",
        "Kevin: I'm...good.",
        "Pam: Well, Toby will stop it. Anytime anyone's ever been fired, Toby's blocked it, so...",
        "Toby: Yeah. Yeah, I don't think...",
        "Dwight: Toby, wait. Wait. Hold that thought. Here's your cake. [squirts frosting on the top] Bye, bye Toby.",
        "Kevin: [crying] At least I got chocolate.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: I bike to work now. Saves on gas, cheaper than a vasectomy and, uh, oh, yeah, it's good for the environment too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: Pam and I are great. She just recently finished her mural for the Irish cultural center.",

        "Pam: [whispering] Angela, are you ready for the wedding?",
        "Angela: [whispering] Yes. My heart is so open, I am so at peace. [scoffs] Look at Meredith. She's disgusting. Those feet. They're like the paws of an orangutan.",
        "Pam: I think she looks good. Now that she's wearing sports bras, we don't see her boobs as much.",
        "Dwight: That is all. Have a good morning.",
        "Meredith: Thank you.",
        "Dwight: [after Angela kisses Dwight] What was that for?",
        "Angela: [laughing] To remind you that our wedding's gonna be wonderful.",
        "Dwight: Ah. I know. It just feels so empty with so many of the old gang gone.",
        "Angela: D, it's gonna be perfect. The only people that need to be there are you and me.",
        "Dwight: Oh, and the old man to feed us the cheese that he's been fermenting since the day of my birth. You keep forgetting about him.",
        "Angela: I don't...I don't know why.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: I brought in some new faces, and one old. I always like Devon. I hired him back after Creed faked his own death in the baler the day after the doc aired. The only person he fooled was Kevin. Then the police showed up. Turns out, Creed was in the band \"The Grass Roots\" in the 1960's. During that time, the police say he sold drugs and trafficked in endangered species meat and stole weapons-grade LSD from the military.",

        "Zeke: Party time! Whorehouse!",
        "Jim: Uh, no. No whorehouse. This is Dwight's night, okay?",
        "Zeke: Well, you're the bestisch mensch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: Dwight has made me his bestisch mensch. Which is Schrute for best man. He's putting himself entirely in my hands tonight. And I know for over 12 years I've done nothing but trick and prank him but tonight...only good surprises. \"Guten Pranken\". [chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: Oh hey, Jim. I forgot to mention. Oftentimes, in Hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties, there are accidental murders. That won't be necessary tonight.",
        "Clark: Great, now we got three hours to fill.",
        "Jim: Okay, hold on. Are you sure Mose isn't going to show up?",
        "Dwight: Ever since Angela moved in and Mose had to stop sleeping at the foot of my bed, he's been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thing.",
        "Jim: Mose has been weird? That's so unlike him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: Yeah, sure, I'll talk about it. Why not? American's next A Cappella Sensation aired my audition. And when I started sobbing uncontrollably, apparently that struck a chord with quite a lot of people. Not a very compassionate chord. The clip went viral, as they say",

        "Andy: Oh, I can so just sit here and cry!",

        "Andy: Two million hits in the first week and then the parodies started. One from the Philippines got 12 million hits. And the late night comedy guys had a field day with it.",

        "Oscar: [on the phone] Years ago, the senator promised a left turn lane by the Arby's. So I wanna know where in the name of horsey sauce is it? Well, yeah, you...hold on.",
        "Dakota: Hi. I keep seeing this symbol in the accounts from last year. It's..it's all over the place. I don't know what it means.",
        "Oscar: That's the reason Kevin got fired. It's his magic number. He used to use it to balance his accounts. He used to call it a Keleven. He told Dwight, [imitating Kevin] \"A mistake plus Keleven gets you home by seven.\" He was home by 4:45 that day.",

        "Toby: Anyone can follow a Twitter feed. Wanna share a cab?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Toby: [alone in cab} After Dwight fired me, I moved to New York to write the great American novel. I have six roommates. Heh. Which are better than friends, you know 'cause they have to give you one month's notice before they leave.",

        "Darryl: Hey, man. How are you doing? I, um...I didn't call 'cause I figured you changed the number.",
        "Andy: No I didn't change the number. All good though. Phone never rings.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: Kismet? Yeah, right. Pam and I came up with excuses for every other weekend. You remember my two lap band surgeries, right? Neither do I? \"Guten Prank\" number one.",

        "Stripper: Mm, I know what you want. I know exactly what you want.",
        "Dwight: Yes, an onion loaf for the table but that's not all. Now the chef special sounded good. What is it exactly?",
        "Stripper: Ohh, shh. [places finger over Dwight's lips]",
        "Dwight: Okay, what are you doing? Are you giving me a taste of the chef's special? Tastes like cigarettes. That won't work. That's no good.",

        "Dwight: You're telling me!",
        "Oscar: If you want her to leave, just tip her.",
        "Dwight: What for? We haven't even gotten bread yet. Does anyone wanna split a twice baked potato? [to the dancing stripper] Do you have those? Those aren't deep fried, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Angela: That was interesting. [creaking sound] What was that?",

        "Oscar: What is that?",
        "Dwight: A ceremonial bridal kidnapping. He will take the bride and hide her at a local pub and when I find the place, I have to buy everyone drinks. Ah, all right! Oh Mose.",
        "Jim: Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub you'd ever set foot in in this town?",
        "Dwight: Right. Which one is that?",
        "Jim: Mm, hey driver. Why don't you take us to 3030 Adams?",

        "Dwight: [to Mose] Why did you pick this place? [Mose points to Jim]",
        "Jim: Ooh.",
        "Dwight: You? You did this as a prank. My own Bestich Mensch.",
        "Jim: Nope, not a prank. I think it's time for you to bury the hatchet.",
        "Dwight: Waste of a good hatchet.",
        "Jim: Okay, just talk.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: It was nothing personal. It's just that you were terrible at your job.",
        "Kevin: You're just saying that to make me feel better.",
        "Dwight: No really. You were terrible at math and organization, time management, personal hygiene. Your internet searches were so filthy we had to throw our your computer.",
        "Kevin: Is that all it was?",
        "Dwight: That's it.",
        "Kevin: Come here [hugs Dwight]",
