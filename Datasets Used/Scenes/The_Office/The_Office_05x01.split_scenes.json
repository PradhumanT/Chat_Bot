        "Michael: All right, everybody. This is your last meal, so eat up. [cheering]",
        "Dwight: From this point forward, you will not use the bathroom. We need to keep our starting weights high so we can lose more.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: This summer, corporate is sponsoring a little weight loss contest between the branches. Whichever branch loses the most weight gets three extra vacation days.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meredith: What should we do with all these leftovers?",
        "Stanley: I'm taking the dumplings for my wife.",
        "Dwight: No, no, no. This is your last meal. There will be no leftovers.",
        "Creed: I can bring these to my shelter.",
        "Stanley: I'm taking my dumplings.",
        "Dwight: [sprays food with bug poison] There. Take those home to your wife.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: Hit the scales, everybody. Right on that black platform. This way. Step it up.",
        "Darryl: Don't go breaking my scale.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: I'm excited to lose weight for the wedding, because I really want to have washboard abs the first time Angela sees me naked.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: Ex-squeeze me.",
        "Michael: No, I will ex-squeeze you.",
        "Michael: OK everybody. Get used to this because we are going to be standing here briefly every Monday for the next seven Mondays.",
        "Dwight: Wait a minute. One more bite of eclair each. Hold it in your mouth if you can't swallow.",
        "Jim: [smiles, looks to Michael][/b] Really, nothing?",
        "Darryl: 2,336 pounds. Y'all need to learn some portion control.",
        "Dwight: Wait a minute. Pam is on the scale.",
        "Michael: Oh, Pamcake. No, no, no. We would love your extra poundage, but you are going to be leaving us next week, so vamoose. Vamoose, Pam. Dunder Mifflin family only.",
        "Dwight: Family only.",
        "Darryl: All right, got it. 2,210 pounds.",
        "Kevin: Pam, you weigh 226 pounds?",
        "Holly: Almost, Kevin.",
        "Pam: Not almost, though, Holly. I mean, not -- not close to 200...",
        "Holly: Math is hard.",
        "Kevin: Yeah.",
        "Pam: Just, we'll just keep going.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: I'm totally gonna slaughter at the weigh-in today.",
        "Oscar: All I had this weekend to eat was a chicken breast and a case of Diet Coke.",
        "Andy: Really? 'Cause I haven't eaten anything since noon on Friday.",
        "Oscar: OK. [holds elevator] Stanley, come on.",
        "Stanley: Oh, I forgot something in my car. I'll see you guys up there. [takes the stairs after the elevator doors close]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stanley: I happen to be losing weight on my own for my own reasons. The truth is, I have lost a little of my speed, a little of my fire. Here's what I used to look like. [holds up old photo] Look at those biceps. We were fighting the power and eating whatever we wanted.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: And arch your back. And slowly bring up your head. [Michael and Holly face each other in yoga pose]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Jimbo.",
        "Jim: Ah, they moved the shower.",
        "Michael: Did you see Holly's butt?",
        "Jim: No, I didn't. [Michael laughs] You know why?",
        "Michael: Why?",
        "Jim: Because most of the time, friends don't talk about other friends' butts.",
        "Michael: I know.",
        "Jim: But what have you learned about her?",
        "Michael: I learned that she broke her left leg twice in one year. I learned that she's allergic to sesame seeds. I learned that she has read \"Lonesome Dove\" three times.",
        "Jim: Nice.",
        "Michael: And that her butt refuses to quit!",
        "Jim: Well, I tried. [Michael laughs]",
        "Michael: [follows Jim into bathroom] You have to agree with me. [follows Jim back out] That's insane.",
        "Jim: I'll just go later.",
        "Michael: I thought you had to pee.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oscar: Hey, if you're into yoga, I take a great bikram class in Dickson City.",
        "Holly: Oh, thanks. I should check that out.",
        "Oscar: Also -- and no pressure -- the teacher? He's a catch.",
        "Holly: Actually, I'm a lesbian.",
        "Oscar: I'm gay!",
        "Holly: I'm not a lesbian. I don't know why I said that... It's a joke.",
        "Oscar: What's the joke?",
        "Holly: There is no joke. I just said it because I haven't had much luck lately and I'm not really looking to date. Maybe I should switch to women.",
        "Oscar: Oh, you think it's a choice?",
        "Holly: Um, I'm gonna head back to my work area and just--",
        "Oscar: I'm messing with you, Holly.",
        "Holly: I knew that. OK, bye.",
        "Oscar: OK.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Tomorrow I start a three-month design program at the Pratt Institute in New York. I will be a little fish in the big apple. [does hand gesture] What up, 212?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: Fax this for me.",
        "Jim: Come on, man. She goes to New York in like 10 minutes.",
        "Dwight: It's not gonna take her 10 minutes to fax it, Jim. [to Pam] If I don't see you again, goodbye. Well, actually, I'll see you when you give me the fax confirmation, so never mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: Ang. Ela. [sings] Ella, ella, ella. Under my Angerela. Ella, ella, ella. Ay, ay--",
        "Angela: What?",
        "Andy: Hey, check it out. [hands her brochure] This is The Breakers, Newport, Rhode Island. Huge, awesome gorgeous mansion overlooking the Atlantic. And my dad went to Cornell with the current groundskeeper.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: Every little boy fantasizes about his fairy-tale wedding.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: [sees Pam and Jim through office window, runs out the office] Hey, hey! [falls down stairs, gets up, falls down again] Pam, Pam! Hey!",
        "Jim: What happened?",
        "Michael: [frazzled and out of breath] I wrote you a goodbye poem. It's really long. I left it up in my office. Could you just please wait till I go get it?",
        "Pam: I should really get going.",
        "Michael: No. OK. Um, the last word is \"seagulls.\"",
        "Pam: I'm sure it was really lovely.",
        "Michael: I took a lot from other poems.",
        "Jim: Call me when you get in. [kisses Pam]",
        "Pam: OK, bye.",
        "Jim: Bye.",
        "Michael: All right, call-- [leans in to kiss Pam]",
        "Pam: No, Michael.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: Why haven't I proposed yet? Uh, actually Pam and I talked about it. And we just decided that, um -- well, we didn't want to spend first three months of our engagement apart. And Pam's always said she doesn't want a long engagement. Something in her past, I guess. I'm not really sure of the whole story, but something about a guy who used to work here...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: OK, no, no, no, no, no, no. Same places as last week.",
        "Angela: It doesn't matter, Michael.",
        "Michael: Yes, it does. No, this is about weight displacement. We have to have the same weight distribution. Right here. Here we go. Let's move that up. Here we go.",
        "Holly: Oh, fancy meeting you here.",
        "Michael: All right.",
        "Darryl: OK, everybody smile. Ho! You lost 31 pounds.",
        "Michael: All right!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: I can't believe I'm saying this, but Michael is actually killing it with Holly. And I think I know why. It's because Holly is kind of a major dork.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: [rapping] I'm MC Mike Scott, and I am hot. She's DJ Jazzy Flax, and she is the best. All those sucker branches can suck our fat!",
        "Holly: Wikka wikka wikka what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ronnie: Dunder Mifflin, this is Ronnie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: I don't really know Ronnie. But I have a feeling I will get to know her very well over the next few years, and eventually declare my love for her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Professor: Sorry I'm late. I accidentally switched my alarm clock setting to Zapf Chancery. [laughter] Which is my terrible segue into our course, Expressive Typography in New Media.",
        "Pam: I'm in the wrong class...",
        "Professor: Some of you may remember from last semester I am Professor Monaghan. [sees Pam leaving] And looks like I'm boring someone already.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: You're shaking. Are you all right?",
        "Kelly: Just leave me alone!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: [sickly] I am on the third day of my cleanse diet. All I have to do is drink maple syrup, lemon juice, cayenne pepper and water for all three meals. Um, I just bought some bikinis online, size 2. So ... gonna look amazing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ronnie: Hi, can I help you?",
        "Jan: I need you to make me 100 copies of this on canary yellow.",
        "Kevin: Hi Jan.",
        "Jan: Hi.",
        "Kevin: How's the candle game?",
        "Jan: Oh, great. Yeah, Serenity by Jan is kicking ass and taking names. You remember last week when that girl went missing? Guess whose candles they used for the vigil?",
        "Kevin: Cool. Thank God they found her, too.",
        "Jan: Oh, they found her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Hi, Jan. Hello, baby. How are you? Good to see you. Who's your daddy? You don't know who your daddy is, do you? No, you don't. [to Jan] Come on. Let's go in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us to believe that he was the father. By telling us that he was the father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: Hey, Oscar. Who's that woman in Michael's office with the feet?",
        "Jan: That's his ex.",
        "Holly: Oh, she's very beautiful.",
        "Oscar: Yes, she is. And clinically insane.",
        "Holly: So, listen, I don't know if your offer still stands or whatever, but you can give your yoga teacher my number.",
        "Oscar: OK.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Angela: Listen, dummy! It's not that hard. All you have to do is take the numbers from the sales report and type them into a master spreadsheet. A G.D. monkey could do it. I do not understand why you can't do it.",
        "Holly: No! You do not talk to him like that!",
        "Angela: But he's an idiot!",
        "Kevin: Hey!",
        "Holly: He is not an idiot!",
        "Kevin: Thank you, Holly.",
        "Holly: He is mentally challenged. But he's doing a super job here.",
        "Kevin: Wait, back up. Do you think that I am retarded?",
        "Holly: Well, no. Dwight...",
        "Angela: Oh, Holly, that is very offensive.",
        "Holly: I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: Hey. So, since my little lady has such particular, impossible to perceive taste, I have made nonrefundable deposits at four totally different wedding locales: Hot-air balloons over Napa Valley, world-famous Walt Disney's Epcot Center, scuba-diving wedding in the Bahamas and the Wilkes-Barre Marriott Ballroom C.",
        "Angela: Dangerous. Tacky. Sharks. Haunted. No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Angela: [walking into storage room] Hurry, we have to make this fast.",
        "Dwight: Let's do this thing.",
        "Angela: [Dwight slaps her butt] Hey!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Angela: I have a nice comforter and several cozy pillows. I usually read a chapter of a book, and it's lights out by 8:30. That's how I sleep at night!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: All right, I am connecting and ... you are not there. Did you install it right? How about this: Go to applications--",
        "Pam: [on computer screen] I can see you!",
        "Jim: All right!",
        "Pam: This is so cool.",
        "Jim: So what is going on, girl in the computer?",
        "Pam: Lunch with a girl from my hall.",
        "Jim: Uh-huh.",
        "Pam: Ceramics class. Then dinner by myself. I'm gonna watch HGTV and maybe go to Bungalow 8 with John Mayer.",
        "Dwight: OK, can you turn the girl off please? I'm trying to get some work done.",
        "Michael: No way. No way. Pam Beesley. Hello. [picks up computer] Hey, everybody look, Pam. Pam, say hi. Say hi to Pam. Don't we all look skinny? Oh, oh, almost dropped you!",
        "Pam: Can you put me down I'm getting a little nauseous?",
        "Michael: Pam, I'd like you to meet Ronnie. We call her Rice-a-Ronnie. She is hilarious. She is wonderful, a beam of light in this dark, dark office. Not really so much. All she does is plop herself down there and answer phones all day.",
        "Pam: The nerve.",
        "Michael: Oh, calm down, weirdo. It's just a joke. She's such a weirdo! You know what? My real beef with her, though, Pam? She can't find those little colored paper clips that I like so much. Will you help her find them, please?",
        "Pam: They're on the supply shelf.",
        "Michael: Let's go. We are following Pam to the supply shelf. Let us go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: New York is so exciting. I love my classes. The city's awesome. Um, can you give me back to Jim now, please?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: OK, everybody, let's suck in our guts.",
        "Darryl: 2,184 pounds, for a grand total -- oh! You all gained five pounds back.",
        "Michael: Damn it. Come on.",
        "Oscar: [Kelly faints] Oh!",
        "Kevin: Oh, my God!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: Come on, Bernard. [Andy spits on floor as warehouse worker walks past]",
        "Michael: Here we go. Everybody on.",
        "Dwight: All right, we're set.",
        "Darryl: Still good. You guys lost a pound. You lost one pound.",
        "Kelly: I was on an IV for two days at the hospital.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stanley: I lost four pounds. I don't know what those other fools were doing, but I lost four pounds.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phyllis: Angela, you'll go to the supermarket and get the New York cheesecake. Make sure it's the generic one. It's Stanley's favorite.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phyllis: Yes, I've replaced Angela as head of the party planning committee. [footage of Dwight and Angela making out] I guess I was just in the right place at the right time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: How's it going?",
        "Phyllis: It's going well.",
        "Michael: Good.",
        "Holly: I have a crazy idea. What if we did, um, fruit instead of cake?",
        "Michael: Cake? Who suggested cake? [Angela points to Phyllis]",
        "Phyllis: We lost weight today. I think it's OK to reward ourselves once in a while.",
        "Michael: Are you kidding me? We only lost one pound, Phyllis.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: What is wrong with these people? They have no willpower. I went -- I once went 28 years without having s*x. And then again for seven years.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Does anyone have any idea what the number one cause of death is in this country?",
        "Dwight: Shotgun weddings.",
        "Jim: That's not what that is.",
        "Creed: Fright. Being scared to death.",
        "Michael: No.",
        "Holly: Obesity-caused illnesses.",
        "Dwight: Obesity-caused illnesses.",
        "Michael: Thank you. Holly is right. People, this is not just about winning some extra vacation days. This is about a very cool HR initiative that if we don't follow, we are all going to die of obesity. So how much are we gonna lose?",
        "Jim: I would like to lose 65 pounds.",
        "Michael: Yes, all right. Who else? [to Angela] Can I put you down for 10 pounds?",
        "Angela: No. My doctor wants me to gain weight.",
        "Michael: If you gain weight, you will die. I want you to live forever. I want us all to live forever. How? How are we going to do this?",
        "Jim: Cryogenics. Beer me five.",
        "Michael: This is how we're gonna do it. Five pounds. I'm asking each of you to lose five pounds. That plus Jim's 65 will give us a very good chance at winning this thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: All right, I'm taking off.",
        "Michael: Booty call.",
        "Jim: Nope, just going to see Pam.",
        "Michael: Here.",
        "Jim: Maybe put up some shelves.",
        "Michael: Wait a second. [removes condom from wallet, throws it to Jim] I don't want you to end up with a surprise pregnancy like me.",
        "Jim: OK, thank you for ... this.",
        "Michael: You want more?",
        "Jim: No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: I don't know if there's any one place that has all these things.",
        "Angela: It's not my problem. [dials phone]",
        "Andy: Thousand-year-old church in the continental United States. There has to be a rainbow. 24-hour veterinarian on call.",
        "Angela: That is very important to me, so -- I have work to do. Just do it. [walks away]",
        "Andy: Sweetheart. [Angela turns around] Just so you know, I don't care where we get married. I'll marry you right here in this building. I'll marry you in the parking lot. I'll marry you in the eye of a hurricane in the middle of a snowstorm on top of a monsoon. All I care about is that we're gonna spend the rest of our lives together.",
        "Andy: [Angela kisses him] Hey-oh!",
        "Angela: I know I haven't made this easy on you. [Dwight comes out of storage room alone, looks at watch.]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: [knocks on door] Hi.",
        "Pam: Hi. [they kiss] Mmm. 'Cause-- [looks toward camera]",
        "Jim: Oh, that's so rude of me. Have you seen, um, Pam's new art? It's right there. Check it out. [closes door]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: [music playing] It's a pretty lame party.",
        "Ronnie: Does anyone want to dance?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: [watching baseball game on TV] Some girl came into Pam's room crying about her roommate stealing her soy milk. So I'm in here waiting it out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phyllis: Stanley, Michael's not here. You can eat a slice of your birthday cake.",
        "Stanley: I don't like cake anymore",
        "Andy: Why not, dawg?",
        "Stanley: Tastes changed. Now all I like is baklava.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: Michael, we have a situation.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: They should not be in that room.",
        "Holly: That's so lame they didn't invite us.",
        "Michael: You know what we should do? We should have a party and not invite them.",
        "Dwight: Yeah!",
        "Michael: Let's go mini-golfing.",
        "Holly: Hey, could I have a rain check on the mini-golf. I, uh, actually have a date tonight.",
        "Michael: Uh...",
        "Holly: It'll probably be a total disaster, but...",
        "Michael: Um, I think you'll have fun. Men from Scranton are handsome, and they know how to show a woman a good time.",
        "Dwight: Not that guy who murdered his mother. He was not so handsome. Also Kevin.",
        "Michael: You know what? We're pretty much done here today. Why don't you just take off early?",
        "Holly: Really?",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Holly: Oh, that's sweet. Wish me luck.",
        "Michael: Good luck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Oh, Holly doesn't need luck. Everyone that meets her instantly loves her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: Party's over. You are so busted!",
        "Michael: OK, everybody. Phyllis, did I or did I not say fruit?",
        "Phyllis: You said fruit, Michael.",
        "Michael: And what is that?",
        "Phyllis: Cake.",
        "Michael: You know, we're gonna have to try a little harder if we are going to win this thing.",
        "Dwight: Happy Birthday, Stanley! [kicks cake onto Michael]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: It's kind of a good news, bad news situation. The bad news is we're not doing very well, so we really had to starve ourselves this whole week.
