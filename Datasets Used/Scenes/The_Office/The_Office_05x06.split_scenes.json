        "Pam: Hey.",
        "Jim: Hey New York, Happy Halloween!",
        "Pam: Thanks. My costume's getting a lot of attention. [Pam is dressed as Charlie Chaplin]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: So apparently no one dresses up for Halloween here. I wish I had known that before I used greasepaint for my moustache. And I can't even take off my hat, because then I'm Hitler.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: [dressed as the Joker] Hm mm mm mm. Want to see a magic trick? Heh heh heh! I'm gonna make a pencil disapp-- oh! [elevator doors close, reopen.] Disappear.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holly: It's been a weird week since we found out I had to transfer. Michael wanted me to quit and get some job here in Scranton, and I said \"Well, why don't you quit and get some job in Nashua?\" And he said \"I asked you first.\" And I said \"First!\" at the same time he did. And then I said \"Jinx.\" And then we never talked about it again and haven't been back to the conversation. So...",

        "Jim: I am off to New York. My brother Pete from Boston, and my brother Tom from New Jersey are taking Pam and I out for lunch, to celebrate the engagement. Or maybe to beat me up. I can never tell with those two.",

        "Andy: Ha ha ha. That's funny. [angrily] Take that sweatshirt off! Hey buddy.",
        "Dwight: Andy.",
        "Andy: Remember when I jokingly yelled at you to take your sweatshirt off? Totally joking. But, you should know, those colors are sacred. Not that I care. But if you're not a Cornell man, you probably shouldn't wear them.",
        "Dwight: No I get it. I totally understand. And uh, I just want to assure you, that I mean no disrespect. You see, I'm applying!",
        "Andy: Come on, you think you can get into Cornell?",
        "Dwight: Well if somebody who barely out-sells Phyllis, can get in, I should be fine.",
        "Phyllis: I'm sitting right here Dwight.",
        "Dwight: I meant that as a compliment to you Phyllis, as well as a slight to Andy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: Cornell is a good school, and I want to better myself through higher education. If it makes Andy angry, so be it. [He sips from his Cornell mug]",

        "Michael: Cool!",
        "Darryl: Mike you'll drive this every weekend?",
        "Michael: We're gonna switch back and forth, the driving. Sometimes we'll just meet in the middle. It'll be fun. Wait a sec. Oh I love this song.",
        "Michael and Holly: Life is a highway, I want to ride it all night long.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: Hey there. So uh, how do you think we're gonna do against Penn this year? Nathan Ford's arm looks pretty strong.",
        "Andy: Well he's had a pretty good season so far--- Stop saying \"we.\" You did not go to Cornell. Okay, you're just doing this to screw with me.",
        "Dwight: Not so. Cornell is an excellent school. Without its agricultural program, we probably wouldn't have cabbage. At least not modern cabbage.",
        "Andy: I know it's an excellent school, Dwight. I went there. My blood runs Big Red.",
        "Dwight: Someday, we'll both get together in Comstock Hall and just laugh about all of this.",

        "Tom: I'm good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: I asked Tom and Pete to come early so we could play a prank on Jim at lunch! Pretty awesome, right? I think they're into the idea. They're probably thinking, \"That Pam Beasly, she's the coolest sister-in-law on the planet. She's the best! The absolute best.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. I'm gonna say that before ceramics class, I took off my ring, and then when I changed back out of my smock, it wasn't in my pocket anymore, and I lost it.",
        "Pete: That's perfect. You know what would be even more hilarious? Remember that thing we did when Jim was in high school with his girlfriend?",
        "Tom: Right! That would be hilarious! We should totally dog her, about being an artist, never making any money!",
        "Pete: That, is awesome!",
        "Tom: Like she basically has a hobby, for a job.",
        "Pete: Oh yeah.",
        "Pam: So, not the ring then? The- the- Not doing the ring?",
        "Pete: I think this is better.",
        "Tom: The other thing would \"get\" Jim.",
        "Pete: This is nicer, it's fun. It's fun!",
        "Pam: Okay, okay.",

        "Michael: Was I? Really? Was I saying anything interesting?",
        "Darryl: Not really.",
        "Michael: All right. What's the scoop, how far?",
        "Darryl: Four hours. Almost halfway there.",
        "Holly: We're only halfway?",
        "Michael: Halfway! Okay, You know what I want to do, I want to pull over and find little bed and breakfast for when we meet in the middle. Emphasis on the bed. And the breakfast.",
        "Darryl: Next exit isn't for five miles.",
        "Holly: Let's check there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Hey guys.",
        "Jim: Hey, how are you?",

        "Pete: Nice to see you again, Pam.",
        "Tom: Pam, I haven't seen you in so, so long!",
        "Jim: All right so now we can sit... and get comfortable.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Darryl: There's nothing out here man.",
        "Michael: Yeah. I don't know I just- I imagined a hotel right here. Pool, over here. Really good breakfast place. With really good bacon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Here we go, fourth time's a charm. \"Life's like a road where you just... one day here, and the next day back...Sometimes you deal with it, today you don't, sometimes you do, what you want... there's a world out there.... [Holly sobs] Hey. Are you crying?",
        "Holly: No.",
        "Michael: Allergies?",
        "Holly: No.",
        "Michael: Did Darryl touch you?",
        "Darryl: WHAT!?",
        "Holly: No, Darryl did not touch me. Can we just keep going, please? [crying]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: What's the matter?",
        "Holly: It's not gonna work.",
        "Michael: Sure it is.",
        "Holly: There's too much distance.",
        "Michael: Oh no no no.. It's gonna work, it'll be fine.",
        "Holly: Michael we've only been dating each other for a few weeks",
        "Michael: Listen to me. I like you so much.",
        "Holly: And I like you too.",
        "Michael: And I've dated four women in the last--",
        "Holly: I've dated four guys last year too.",
        "Michael: Not last - no. In like the last ten years.",
        "Holly: Oh.",
        "Michael: I've dated almost four women, and you are so far above them, it is stupid.",
        "Holly: Michael. Don't. Don't. Don't make it harder than it has to be.",
        "Michael: That's what she said.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Holly thinks that this relationship is over. Well, you know what? I am not gonna give up that easy. I'm gonna make this way harder than it needs to be.",

        "Dwight: Excuse me?",
        "Andy: Take. That down.",
        "Meredith: You know I once dated a couple of guys from Cornell. They were really nice. They gave me a ride home.",
        "Andy: I seriously doubt that anyone from Cornell dated you.",
        "Creed: It's pronounced Ker-nell. It's the highest rank in the military.",
        "Andy: It's pronounced \"Corn-ell!\" It's the highest rank in the Ivy League!",
        "Dwight: Andy, let's just talk about this man-to-man, after work.",
        "Andy: Fine.",
        "Dwight: What do you say?",
        "Andy: Yeah, good. Can we--- [Dwight pulls out Cornell mascot bobble-head] Grr. Heh heh heh. That's Big Red Bear! That's a bobble Big Red Bear! God!!",

        "Holly: If you leave on Friday, by five, you'll be rolling in at... midnight? At best?",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Holly: And then sleep in Saturday. That only leaves us less than 24 hours before you have to go back again.",
        "Michael: Okay, okay. I will talk to you on the Bluetooth the entire trip. So we're talking constantly all the way.",
        "Holly: Oh.",
        "Michael: I'll tell you everything that I see. Everything that I pass by, things that I witness on the road.",
        "Holly: Well-",
        "Michael: Maybe I'll see an accident one weekend?",
        "Holly: How long could we keep that up?",
        "Michael: Years!",
        "Holly: Years?",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Holly: Years? Of just a few hours every weekend?",
        "Michael: Here's my wish. I want you to meet a great guy, and I want you to be happy.",
        "Holly: [kisses his temple] Thank you.",
        "Michael: My wish has come true, incidentally, because, you've met me, and you are happy.",
        "Darryl: Clever, Mike.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: So Pam, how much does an artist make after they leave art school?",
        "Pete: Yeah, not a lot of money in the arts, right?",
        "Jim: That's not really true. There's a lot of things you can do with an art degree actually.",
        "Tom: Maybe Pam should pay the check by drawing a picture on this napkin.",
        "Jim: Wow, that's- that's a little rude. What's your deal?",
        "Pete: Hey, just having fun Jimmy.",
        "Tom: Yeah. Right Pam?",
        "Pam: Yup! [Tom and Pete give Halpertian looks to camera]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: You know what? I think we're a great couple. I think we're a classic couple. I think we're like Romeo and Juliet. I think we... go together so well. We're like peanut butter and jelly, don't you think?",
        "Holly: I do, I think so.",
        "Michael: Then don't do it. Please don't do this. Please don't do this. [they continue arguing]",
        "Darryl: [leaving someone a message on his cell phone, looking very uncomfortable] Hey what's up, I just thought I'd try you. I was thinking about that story where you ran into the girl you used to babysit.",
        "Michael: I don't know what I'm gonna do!",
        "Darryl: Please call me back.",
        "Michael: Please?",
        "Holly: You'll be okay",
        "Michael: I'm not gonna be okay.",
        "Darryl: Please...",
        "Holly: You will.",
        "Michael: No I won't! I'm not strong! And I'll go back to Jan, and I hate Jan! Oh God!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: [outside men's room] You might be interested- [stops when he sees Stanley come out]",
        "Stanley: What?",
        "Andy: Dwight!",
        "Dwight: Andy, I've been meaning to ask you, which a cappella group should I join? The Harmoniacs, or the Do-Re-Mi-Go's?",
        "Andy: Hm. Assuming you had the voice to be in any of them, it's irrelevant. Because I called admissions and it looks like I, will be conducting your university interview.",
        "Dwight: That's a conflict of interest.",
        "Andy: Yeah. Big one. So, should I not let you in now, or do you want to do the interview, and then I won't let you in?",
        "Dwight: [thinks] Interview.",
        "Andy: Excellent. When the hourglass strikes three, then in the room whence employees confer.",
        "Dwight: What?",
        "Andy: The conference room!",
        "Dwight: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: Who are your role models?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: If I had to put Dwight's chances into a percentage, I would say he has none percent chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: So, Dane Cook, Jack Bauer, and Eli Whitney. You're doing great.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: Oh wow. This is my niece Vanessa. She's a trumpeter. And, look at her.",
        "Pam: Cute.",
        "Jim: That must be really fun for you and Marci huh?",
        "Tom: Yup. She only knows how to play \"When the Saints go Marching In.\"",
        "Jim: Love that one.",
        "Pete: Yeah but, she doesn't think she's gonna be like, career musician right?",
        "Jim: Here you go again! What is your deal today?",
        "Pete: Just saying. How many famous trumpeters can you name besides... Louis Armstrong?",

        "Pam: Dizzy Gillespie.",
        "Jim: Also good.",
        "Pete: And there are hobbies. I love baseball more than anything, but you don't see me try to get on the Mets.",
        "Tom: You don't!",
        "Jim: Pete couldn't make the Mets. She's at Pratt. You played JV baseball. Will you lighten up a little bit?",
        "Pete: I'm just calling it like I see it.",
        "Pam: I don't know if I'm gonna make any money with art.",
        "Jim: Pam, don't worry about it.",
        "Pam: I mean it's a very competitive field. But I have a professor who says I have a lot of promise, and if I don't try now, I never will. So...",
        "Jim: Guys, what is going on?! [Pete and Tom burst out in laughter]",
        "Tom: We pranked you!",
        "Pete: It was Pam's idea. Pam was the mastermind.",
        "Pam: ... Got you.",
        "Pete: That was killer. I was so close to blowing it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: Let's see how well you know your Big Red history.",
        "Dwight: Bring it.",
        "Andy: Who was Cornell's eighth president?",
        "Dwight: Dale Raymond Corson!",
        "Andy: Mm, I'm sorry that's incorrect. Cornell's seventh president was in fact, James A. Perkins. [writes in a notebook] Comprehension skills, sub-par.",
        "Dwight: Hmm, interviewing skills, sub-par. [writes in a notebook]",
        "Andy: What are you writing? Can't even give Cornell your full attention?",
        "Dwight: On the contrary, I'm helping Cornell. By evaluating their interviewers.",
        "Andy: Nobody wants ...that, to happen.",
        "Dwight: Well, when they get my evaluation we'll see if they're interested.",
        "Andy: \"Applicant is attempting to blackmail interviewer, showing low moral character.\"",
        "Dwight: \"Interviewer is threatening applicant with an arbitrary review process.\"",
        "Andy: \"Applicant is wasting everyone's time with stupid and inane accusations.\"",
        "Dwight: \"Interviewer has suspect motives.\"",
        "Andy: \"Applicant has a head shaped like a trapezoid.\"",
        "Dwight: \"Interviewer has turned off applicant's interest in Cornell, and they are going to go to the vastly superior Dartmouth.\" Ever heard of it? I think I have everything I need.",
        "Andy: I have everything I need- [talking over each other]",
        "Dwight: And you will be hearing from the -",
        "Andy: And you will be hearing from -",
        "Dwight: -Cornell Application Department,",
        "Andy: which I will not be a part of-",
        "Dwight: And you will not be pleased with the result. [pulls table away from Andy]",
        "Andy: And YOU will not be pleased with the result!",
        "Dwight: And your affiliation with Cornell -",
        "Andy: And your affiliation with Cornell -",
        "Dwight: Will end completely!",
        "Andy: Will end completely!",
        "Dwight: [has won the table war] That is all sir, you may go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Darryl: [Michael and Holly cautiously pass each other] There's another dolly in the truck, Mike. You could take more than that lamp.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: For the record, I wanted go another direction. Which was way better.",
        "Jim: Well, I'll be the judge of that. What do you got?",
        "Pam: Okay. I lost my engagement ring in ceramics class. Left it in my smock. I had this whole thing where I go back to class, wrongly accuse another girl. Look I even used makeup to put a ring around my finger, you can hardly see it, it's very subtle.",
        "Jim: That is good.",
        "Pam: Thank you.",
        "Jim: Truthfully anything would have been better than that prank. [laughs] Oh, text message from my brother. \"Pam cool. Welcome to the family.\"",
        "Pam: Oh. Hey how about at Thanksgiving we prank Tom about being bald?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Darryl: This is the last of it.",
        "Michael: Oh that's mine actually. Um, maybe put it back in the truck.",
        "Darryl: You're not staying?",
        "Michael: You know I have some things I need to do this weekend. I just remembered, so, I'll just ride back with you.",
        "Darryl: But you want me to put it back in the truck.",
        "Michael: I'll be down in just a second. [into house] Holly?",

        "Darryl: I know it's hard Mike. Break-ups hurt.",
        "Michael: We didn't break up.",
        "Darryl: Looked like it. Sometimes when I'm down like this, it helps to sing the blues.",
        "Michael: Okay.",
        "Darryl: [bluesy] Da na na na na... da na na na na...",
        "Michael: That's a really pretty song.",
