        "Robert challenges the Dunder Mifflin staffers to double their sales. Andy decides to create an incentive program; he promises the office that he will tattoo a picture of their choosing on his buttocks if they meet the sales quota, which they do in only one day. The office then makes Andy get a tattoo of a puppy. Pam Halpert ( Jenna Fischer ) becomes unlikely friends with Angela Lipton ( Angela Kinsey ), who is also pregnant."

        "Kevin: Me do it now. Go. Stop worry.",
        "Pam: Kevin, do you feel OK?",
        "Kevin: Me feel good. Body strong. Sleep big last night.",
        "Pam: Yeah, I think we should get him to the hospital.",
        "Jim: Yeah, alright Kev why don't you come with us?",
        "Oscar: No, guys.",
        "Angela: No, he's fine.",
        "Oscar: He's fine.",
        "Angela: He's always been like that.",
        "Pam: No he hasn't.",
        "Angela: I mean, he's gotten worse over the years....",
        "Oscar: He's making a statement. It's an ironic comment on our expectations of him. A funhouse image of our model of Kevin.",
        "Kevin: You keep think that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Me mechanic not speak English. But he know what me mean when me say \"car no go\", and we best friends. So me think: why waste time, say lot word when few word do trick?",

        "Andy: Kevin, I appreciate what you're trying to do.",
        "Kevin: Thank.",
        "Andy: Here, we have a word code, the same way we have a dress code. And what we're talking about is...basically the speech equivalent... to just wearing underpants. Sometimes words, you no need use...but need need for talk talk.",
        "Kevin: But save time. More success.",
        "Jim: Does it save time though? 'Cause we've been here for about an hour.",

        "Andy: What are you gonna do with all this time?",
        "Kevin: See world.",
        "Pam: Kevin, you cannot possibly save enough time to see the world.",
        "Jim: K, Kevin, are you saying \"See the world\"? or \"Sea World?\"",
        "Kevin: See world. Oceans. Fish. Jump. China.",
        "Jim: No, see? Right there, that's the problem with your method. 'Cause I still don't know if you're saying \"Sea World\" or \"see the world,\" and it's taking a lot of time to explain it.",
        "Kevin: Fine, fine. I'll talk normally.",

        "Pam: It's huge. How much does it weigh?",
        "Dwight: Oh no no no. Without the battery pack and optional memory booster, it's barely three pounds.",
        "Ryan: How much memory does it have without the booster?",
        "Dwight: Fifty L.",

        "Andy: I just wanted to pop in and get your opinions on ties...and tie clips. Which combo do you think Robert is going to like more? [To Oscar] What do you think, C-SPAN?",
        "Oscar: ...\"C-SPAN\"?",
        "Andy: Yeah. C-SPAN, cocker spaniel. Spaniel because of your Spanish bloodline and cocker cause......",
        "Dwight: Is this really the best use of our collective time?",
        "Andy: I am still forming a first impression with Robert. Once it is formed, we can all relax. Ok, I'm sorry to hijack your meeting , D dub dog...had to pull rank.",
        "Dwight: [to group] OK, let's look at some ties.",

        "Robert: Andy, do you know why I chose you?",
        "Andy: I think I can sum it up with what I think is your favorite ice cream flavor....vanilla?",
        "Robert: Vanilla? No no no no. You'll never guess in a million billion years you'll never guess.",
        "Andy: You were saying you chose me.... There was a reason?",

        "Robert: It's a wrong answer.",
        "Kevin: There are no wrong answers.",
        "Robert: Take a look at where you are, where you once worked in a dying industry, you now work at it's birth. Those superstores are terrified of us. Anybody know why?",
        "Phyllis: Wait....they're terrified?",
        "Robert: Let me tell you how I buy something these days. I know what I want I go on the internet, I get the best price. Or I don't know what I want and I go to a small store that can help me. The era of personal service is back. You are back. You'll find that customers will pay our higher prices and then they will thank us, and we will say to them \"you are welcome.\" [Applause] Andrew, I chose you for a reason. Lead these people. Show me the best numbers this place has ever seen. Last quarter we saw 4% growth. Double it.",
        "Andy: You got it.",
        "Robert: Double.",
        "Andy: Done.",
        "Robert: I'm not kidding.",

        "Andy: What's up, guys? Just thought we'd have a little rap session, talk about business...see how things are going? Ahem...",
        "Jim: Why don't you start?",
        "Andy: If no one else wants to? I was just thinking about Robert...man. What a boss. Just throws down goals, you know? Anyway, how's the sales doubling ...project going?",
        "Phyllis: Yeah, how are we supposed to do that? We can't just press a magic button.",
        "Andy: OF course not. There's no magic button. You have to summon that.",
        "Stanley: If we could just double our sales, we already would have. You're not making any sense.",
        "Jim: He brings up two good points. Do you have any new leads? Any new territories you want us to look into? Maybe have an in with a big client that we can get our foot in the door?",
        "Andy: Dwight, anything?",
        "Dwight: We could talk about how fast children grow up, and before you know it they're out of the house.",
        "Andy: You know what? We need to get our heads out of the box. If we did have something, what would it look like, what would it be? [Jim raises hand] Tuna.",
        "Jim: New leads, a new territory to look into, maybe an in with a big company that we could get our foot in the door...",

        "Justine: Hello. I'm looking for Darryl Philbin?",
        "Kevin: Don't! oh, you must think...I'm not. I'm using the fax, this isn't, no wait. I'm not supposed to represent the company. Right? There's usually an Erin here.",
        "Justine: Ok....?",
        "Kevin: So...DARRYL! A GIRL!",
        "Darryl: [Singing] rub a dub dub...I got scrubbed. 'Sup, darlin'? Everybody, this is Justine. [murmurs of hello from the group] This is Jim and Oscar, everybody.",
        "Meredith: Hi.",
        "Kevin: Kevin.",
        "Justine: Can we.... go some place private?",
        "Darryl: Follow me, I got a space. After you. I've been thinking about you all mornin'. I don't know what you did, I can barely walk today.",

        "Andy: D-Bone. There you are.",
        "Dwight: Let me guess, somebody needs a brownie...? Lick the spoon?",
        "Andy: No, that's ok. Just, I want, I wanted to ask you about...",
        "Dwight: Is this about the profits? Because if it is I just don't see the point. It's so Wall Street.",
        "Andy: I know, right?",
        "Dwight: Right?",
        "Andy: Yeah...um, how is everything?",
        "Dwight: Good. Really really good.",
        "Andy: Must be a tough time to be a family farm.",
        "Dwight: Oh, it is. And beets are not immune. We made some inroads in salads, but heirloom tomatoes are pushing back.",
        "Andy: Oof. What are you gonna do about that?",
        "Dwight: I don't know, what do you mean?",
        "Andy: There's gotta be some way you can double your beet sales...",
        "Dwight: You wanted the job, the job is yours. Just do the job! [Licks brownie battered finger] And I'll do mine..... walnuts?",

        "Angela: Have you seen this? [Hands Pam Parenting magazine]",
        "Pam: Parenting? Yeah. This is Cici's favorite magazine. She loves the pictures of babies.",
        "Jim: She looks at it when she's on the potty, and she makes the faces.",
        "Angela: Have you read it? Has an adult member of your family read this particular issue?",
        "Pam: I flipped through it.",
        "Angela: So you saw the article on the importance of taking frequent walks while you're pregnant?",
        "Pam: Of course.",
        "Jim: We know that.",
        "Pam: Yeah.",
        "Angela: I will be taking a morning walk and an afternoon walk. Would you like to join me?",

        "Andy: Thanks for coming in guys.",
        "Phyllis: You don't have to thank us for coming in, it's our job.",
        "Andy: Well I never got thanked for coming into a meeting and I always wanted to be so I'm gonna thank people.",
        "Meredith: What's with the blanket?",
        "[Andy removes blanket over table to reveal various items]",
        "Andy: This is what's under the blanket.",
        "Oscar: We don't get it.",
        "Andy: These are incentives. It's how we're gonna double growth. Now, you're probably all asking yourselves: \"Well, how does this work?\"",
        "Pam: Seems like a basic reward system where you give us points, and then we redeem those points for prizes.",
        "Andy: You're exactly right and you get a point.",
        "Pam: Oh. [smiling]",
        "Ryan: Uh, is that a vibrator?",
        "Andy: Twenty points.",
        "Meredith: How does one get a point?",
        "Andy: I've outlined the exact parameters in an email, so check your spam folders, but basically you do your job better, you get points. So, collect fifteen points and redeem them for this polar bear.",
        "Kelly: Why is it all kid stuff and a vibrator? It's so gross.",
        "Andy: There's lots of stuff. John Irving, collected works, Twenty-two points. Or, you can pool your points and redeem fifty-five for this maternity shirt.",
        "Stanley: How 'bout you want us to work harder, pay us more.",
        "Andy: I can't.",
        "Kelly: This point system is really insulting.",
        "Andy: Ooh I didn't mean to offend you, and I hope you'll forgive me because I am very very... Sari. [tosses yellow print material over shoulder] Sixteen points.",
        "Kelly: That's a tablecloth.",
        "Jim: What if we went all the way up to five hundred points?",
        "Andy: That's a crazy amount of points.",
        "Jim: But, what if?",
        "Andy: Well, what do you want?",
        "Jim: I don't know, for such a crazy number I'd like something pretty crazy.",
        "Andy: Alright. For five hundred points, I will wear a dress to work. [laughter]",
        "Jim: That's pretty good. What about uh, for a thousand points?",
        "Andy: I'll run naked through the parking lot with a donut on my ding-dong. [laughter] Yeah? You like that? Alright! For five thousand points, I will let you tattoo whatever you want on the stern of the old SS Bernard![Andy points to his rear-end]",
        "Group: Ooooh!",
        "Oscar: Really?",
        "Jim: Alright, alright. And you are totally serious?",
        "Andy: Swear to God, hope to die. Now let's get to work!",
        "Jim: Wait. You did say we could pool our points, right? In that case...let's get to work.",
        "Dwight: Yeah!",
        "Pam: Yeah! Whoo! [Group cheers]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Jim: Ok.",
        "Andy: T-bag bone...",
        "Jim: Andrew.",
        "Andy: Have you noticed a little bit of a mood shift around here?",
        "Jim: No, I didn't notice anything.",
        "Andy: Really? Because I sat next to Stanley for years....and this is nap time. Open eye nap time. He balances the phone on his shoulder and just powers down. Now look at him.",
        "Stanley: [On the phone] You've got to unleash the power of the Pyramid!",
        "Jim: I don't know what to tell you, man.",
        "Andy: You think it has something to do with that incentive program?",
        "Jim: Oh, one hundred percent. We all want to see you tattoo your ass.",
        "Andy: Bah...I think people thought I was kidding when I said that.",
        "Jim: Nah, you definitely weren't kidding. And that came across loud and clear. Oh, by the way, I want to hand this in. [hands Andy slip of paper]",
        "Andy: Hundred and twenty points.",
        "Jim: Yeah. Big sale. Don't worry about it though, I don't really care about the points. I would like a point receipt though...[on phone] Hey! Yes, this is Jim Halpert calling for Donald...can you hold on for one second? Thank you very much. [gets up to give Erin his point receipt]",
        "Pam: Who talked to Maggie at Kaufman's?",
        "Erin: Yes! [adds receipt to growing pile and thumbs up Andy.]",
        "Jim: [on the phone]and I'm back. How are you sir?....I think we can squeeze a couple more golf games in, right?",
        "Pam: Where's Angela? [Hands paper over her shoulder]",
        "Andy: Hey Kevin, what are you doing?",
        "Kevin: Don't talk to me! [Everyone continues to work busily]",

I may be missing a chapter here...De-Incentivizing. What are your strategies? Looking for a real blow to morale...uh why?
