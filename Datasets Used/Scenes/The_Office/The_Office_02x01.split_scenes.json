        "Michael: Tonight is the Dundies, the annual employee awards night here at Dunder Mifflin. [holds up a trophy of a business man] And this is everybody's favorite day. Everybody looks forward to it, because, you know, a lot of the people here don't get trophies, very often. Like Meredith or Kevin, I mean, who's gonna give Kevin an award? Dunkin' Donuts? Plus, bonus, it's really, really funny. So I, you know, an employee will go home, and he'll tell his neighbor, \"Hey, did you get an award?\" And the neighbor will say, \"No man. I mean, I slave all day and nobody notices me.\" Next thing you know, employee smells something terrible coming from neighbor's house. Neighbor's hanged himself due to lack of recognition. So...",

        "Jim: So, you ready for the... the Dundies?",
        "Pam: Ugh...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: You know what they say about a car wreck, where it's so awful you can't look away? The Dundies are like a car wreck that you want to look away, but you have to stare at it because your boss is making you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: [in a Fat Albert voice] Hey hey hey! It's Fat Halpert.",

        "Michael: [in Fat Albert voice] Fat Halpert. [in normal voice] Jim Halpert.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: So why don't I take you on a tour of past Dundie winners. We got Fat Jim Halpert here. Jim, why don't you show of your Dundies to the camera?",
        "Jim: Oh, I can't because I keep them hidden. I don't want to look at them and get cocky.",
        "Michael: Oh, that's a good idea.",
        "Dwight: Mine are at home in a display case above my bed.",
        "Michael: Gyaaah. T.M.I. T.M.I my friends.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: T.M.I.? Too much information. Ah, it's just easier to say T.M.I. I used to say \"Don't go there\" but that's... lame.",

        "Michael: And here we have Stanley the Manly. Now Stanley is a Dundie all-star, aren't you Stan? Why don't you, ah, show them some of your bling.",
        "Stanley: I don't know where they are, I think I threw them out.",
        "Michael: Oh, no you di-int.",
        "Stanley: I think I did.",
        "Michael: W-why did you...",
        "Stanley: Say, we got to order some more apa-teezers this time. We ran out last year, remember?",
        "Michael: Yes we should. I... you know what? I wanted one of those skillets of cheese, but when I got off stage, [turns to Kevin] someone had eaten all of them.",

        "Michael: [in video] He has the award-ah! ...it's a type of song that we are going to play for the ladies. Hit it, Dwight!",
        "[Dwight starts playing the tune of \"Mambo No. 5\" by Lou Bega on his recorder]",
        "Michael: [singing along to tune on video] A little bit of Paaam, all night long, a little bit of Angela on the thing...",
        "[Somebody sits in front of the camera on the video, so even though nothing can be seen, Michael can still be heard]",
        "Michael: [in video]...a little bit of Phyllis everywhere...",
        "Pam: Oh, yeah, this is the part where Kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night. It's great.",
        "Michael: [on video] ...a little bit of Roooy eating chicken crispers... ...a little bit of Jim with some ribs, a little bit of...",

        "Kelly: It was you.",
        "Phyllis: Live and learn.",
        "Pam: [quietly laughing] It wasn't. I swear.",
        "Kelly: Yeah, it was.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: So, what's the joke? You're not perfect either.",
        "Pam: We're not laughing at you, Dwight.",
        "Dwight: So who are we laughing at?",
        "Pam: Um, just something somebody wrote.",
        "Dwight: Who? Dave Barry?",
        "Kelly: [laughing] No. No, just something that was written in the ladies' room wall.",
        "Dwight: What is it? Who wrote it?",
        "Pam: Um, it's kind of private.",
        "Phyllis: [whispering] It's about Michael.",
        "Dwight: That is defacement of company property. So you better tell me. Kelly, if you tell me, you'll be punished less.",
        "Pam: Okay, now I'm laughing at you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: [talking to the speakerphone] Will her highness, Jan Levinson-Gould, be descending from her corporate throne this evening to visit us lowly serfs here at Dunder Mifflin Scranton?",
        "Jan: [on speaker phone] It's a, it's, it's a two and a half hour drive from New York, Michael.",
        "Michael: Well, you could take the bus. You could work on the way here. Sleep on the way home.",
        "Jan: No.",
        "Michael: Wuh... Come on, Jan. This is important. I mean, this is, this is, validation to my employees here that you and corporate approve of this. So...",
        "Jan: No, we don't approve of this Michael. I mean, y-you only had the budget for one office party a year, so... we're not paying for this.",
        "Michael: Um...",
        "[Michael looks at the camera and motions for the camera to leave the office]",
        "Michael: [to camera] Could you...?",
        "Jan: Are you there Michael?",
        "Michael: Yeah, I'm here, I just wanted to, uh, talk to you for a second about that.",
        "[Michael closes the blinds]",
        "[The camera tries to find a crack in the blinds]",
        "Michael: Um, what, ah, what is, I mean...",
        "[The camera pans around to reception, Pam is listening]",
        "Michael: ...come on, Jan!",
        "[The camera goes to a side of Michael's office where the blinds are still partially open]",
        "Michael: You're dropping an A-Bomb on me here.",
        "Jan: Really? I'm dropping an atomic bomb on you?",
        "Michael: Well, yeah, I mean, what is...",
        "Jan: You already had a party on May 5th for no reason.",
        "Michael: No reason?! It was the 05 05 05 party...",
        "Jan: And you had a luau....",
        "Michael: ...it happens once every billion years.",
        "Jan: And a tsunami relief fundraiser which somehow lost a lot of money.",
        "Michael: Okay, no, that was a FUN raiser. I think I made that very clear in the fliers, fun, F-U-N.",
        "Jan: Okay, well, I don't understand why anyone would have a tsunami FUN raiser, Michael. I mean, that doesn't even make sense.",
        "Michael: Well, I think a lot of people were very affected by the footage.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: This is a little character I like to do [places a green turban with a yellow feather on his head], it is, uh, loosely based on Karnack, one of Carson's classic characters. [puts an envelope to his head] Here we go. The PLO, the IRA, and the hot dog stand behind the warehouse. [tears open envelope and pulls out card] \"Name three businesses that have a better health care plans than Dunder Mifflin.\" Here's the problem. There's no open bar because of Jan and it's the reason why comedy clubs have a two drink minimum. It'll be fine, I just...wish people were going to be drunk.",

        "[Phyllis catches Dwight trying to sneak into the girls bathroom]",

        "Dwight: ...no, no, no, no, it's not what you think.",
        "Phyllis: Why were you peering over the stalls?!",
        "Dwight: No, why were you in there?!",
        "Phyllis: You are a pervert!",
        "Dwight: What were you doing in there?",

        "[Jim, at the adjacent table, crosses his arms and glances over at Pam, both look annoyed]",

        "Roy: [on video] Yes.",
        "Michael: [on video] Thank you Roy. Are there any words you'd like to say, on Pam's behalf?",
        "Roy: [on video] Ah, w-we'll see you next year.",
        "Michael: [on video] Yeah, oh, hope not! Oh God!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: I'm not changing that, it's the best one.",
        "Jim: No, it's hilarious, you're right. I just think, um, \"world's longest engagement\", um, we're all expecting it, you know?",
        "Michael: That's why it's funny. Every year that Roy and Pam don't get married, it gets funnier.",
        "Jim: Well I think if you use the same jokes it just comes across as lazy.",
        "Michael: Oh, [taking it to heart] lazy. Uh huh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: Excuse me, everyone, could I have your attention please. I just wanted to say that the women in this office are terrible. Especially the ones who wrote that stuff about Michael on the bathroom wall. Having a bathroom is a privilege. It is called a ladies room for a reason. And if you cannot behave like ladies, well then you are not going to have a bathroom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: You're taking away our bathroom?",
        "Dwight: We are going to have two men's rooms.",
        "Phyllis: But where would we...go?",
        "Dwight: Be prepared to hold folks [Michael comes out of his office] From 9 am to...",
        "Pam: Michael...",
        "Michael: Yes.",
        "Pam: ...Dwight is banning us from our bathroom.",
        "Michael: Okay, well, that's just ridiculous, so just don't, I-I don't have time for this right now.",
        "Dwight: Nnnnno, there needs to be repercussions...",
        "Michael: Just don't, don't talk-",
        "Dwight: ...for people's behavior.",
        "Michael: Don't talk-",
        "Dwight: And it's-",
        "Michael: Just STAP IT YAP IT!!!!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Okay, look, I know there have been a lot of rumors flying around about the Dundies this year. How there is no money, and how there is no food, and how the jokes are really bad, but WHAT THE HELL EVERYBODY!? I mean, God. The Dundies are about the best, in every, one of us. Can't you see that? I mean, okay, we can do better. so, tonight, for the first time, we are inviting all of your friends and family to attend the awards with us.",
        "Dwight: [with a small fist pump] Yes!",
        "Michael: Yeah, not bad, right? So let's make this the best Dundies ever.",
        "Dwight: [clapping] Best Dundies ever.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: \"The Dundies, how can I explain it? Awards you like to hate it. I'm psyched you all made it. You never had to work so hard and feel that no one notices you. You're just a name and number and no one even says hello.\" [to Ryan] Card!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oscar: The Dundies are kind of like a kid's birthday party, and you go, and there's really nothing for you to do there. But the kid's having a really good time, so you're, kind of there. That's-that's kind of what it's like.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: \"You down with The Dundies? You down with the Dundie-\"",
        "[The music stops, Michael looks back at Dwight]",
        "Dwight: The waitress tripped on the cord.",
        "Michael: Alright, alright, joke landed. So we are here, thank you all for coming to the 2005 Dundie awards. [takes off sweater to reveal tuxedo] I am your host, Michael Scott. And I just want to tell you please, please, do not drink and drive. Because you may hit a bump and spill the drink!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: [to waitress] Oh, just put these on the group tab.",
        "Michael: Nope, actually this year, ah, no group tab, we're going to be doing separate checks.",
        "Stanley: You said, we could bring our families.",

        "Michael: Well, I'm looking forward to meeting Terri.",
        "Stanley: It's this person who's hand I'm holding Michael.",
        "[Michael is dumbfounded, Dwight pushes a button on his keyboard that says, \"OHHH, YEAHHHH.\"]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: [to Dwight, in a low voice] Shut it. [normal voice] Um, good. Speaking of relationships, of all, all way shapes and forms. Um, I was out on a very, very hot date with a girl from HR, Dwight.",
        "Dwight: Really? We don't have any girls from HR.",
        "Michael: No, that...for the sake of the story. And things were getting hot and heavy.",
        "Dwight: Yeah?",
        "Michael: And I was about to take her bra off...",
        "Dwight: Yeah!",
        "Michael: ...when she made me fill out six hours of paperwork-",
        "Dwight: Like an AIDS test?",
