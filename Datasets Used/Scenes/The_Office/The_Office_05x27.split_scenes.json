        "To break the staff of the focus Charles instilled in them, Michael opens a cafe-disco in the downstairs office to release stress. While initially resistant, all the staff (even Angela) join as Kelly and Andy bond in a dance-off. Pam and Jim plan to elope but later reconsider. Phyllis suspects Bob will have an affair, but drops her suspicions as they sound absurd saying them aloud. Cafe disco ends up being a hit."

        "Erin: Oh my God! I can't believe it! I jut won an art contest! [Erin screams, Pam and Jim look at each other, Dwight, laughing, gets up and hands her some money]",
        "Erin: [whispering] Thanks. I still don't understand why you wanted me to say that.",
        "Dwight: Shut up.",

        "Michael: [caught by camera crew dancing to \"At the Car Wash\", but laughing] Oh, no. I still have the lease on the Michael Scott Paper Company, so occasionally I will sneak down here for a little coffee and dancing. I actually dance all the time. Tip-toeing around corporate - it is a ballet. When I am breaking all the rules, I am break dancing. And expresso.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Guys, I'm scared. I'm really scared. I think I'm growing into a giant. Because look at this normal sized coffee cup. Looks so tiny in my giant hand now. Anybody want to go to lunch with me later on?",
        "Dwight: I do.",
        "Michael: Okay. How about a woman? Pam?",
        "Pam: Oh, I can't do lunch. I was just sending you an email. Jim and I need to leave early today to meet with our contractor.",
        "Michael: Oh, really? Ok.",
        "Pam: Just sent it.",
        "Michael: What about the rest of you? [complete silence]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: At Dunder-Mifflin there is a very strict no lunch with the boss policy and I don't know who instituted it. I think it started right after my predecessor stepped down, but at the Michael Scott Paper Company I really enjoyed having lunch with Pam and Ryan everyday. So, rules be damned, I wanna have lunch with these people.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Who else? Who else? Ryan?",
        "Ryan: I don't do lunch. I'm eating five small meals a day now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ryan: Now that I'm back to doing the job of a temp, again, I find that food is one thing I can control.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Ok. Anyone? Anyone? At all? Accounting? I am accounting on you to go to lunch with me.",
        "Angela: No. I don't want to stay late to have a two hour lunch.",
        "Phyllis: Michael, we have a lot of work to do.",
        "Michael: What?",
        "Phyllis: Work.",
        "Michael: Ugh! God! What happened to you people? [talking like a robot] We are just office drones. We are office drones. All we do is work... is work.",

        "Erin: Hi, guys. How you doing?",
        "Dwight: Erin, how many times do I have to tell you? It is not necessary for you to ask us how we are doing every time you interact with us.",
        "Erin: Right. I'm sorry.",
        "Dwight: [sighs] Now, how can I help you?",
        "Erin: Did somebody here leave a map in the printer to Youngstown, Ohio?",
        "Dwight: Attention, office. Who here is planning a trip to Youngstown, Ohio? I will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something. This location is the Superior Court -",
        "Pam: So someone is going to a court. Big deal.",
        "Dwight: It is a big deal. Cause there's only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in Ohio and not be charged with a crime. To claim an inheritance from a deceased relative. To obtain a learner's permit at age 14 and a half instead of 15. Erin, let me see your birth certificate.",
        "Erin: Sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: There are other reasons to go to Ohio.",
        "Pam: We're getting married today.",
        "Jim: So, it turns out it's the closest place to get a marriage license without a 3 day waiting period.",
        "Pam: Tell 'em how it happened.",
        "Jim: Ok. So, we're going through all the wedding plans and, boy, it is complicated.",
        "Pam: And very expensive.",
        "Jim: Very expensive. Cause you say you want a small wedding and that's great but then you have to invite -",
        "Pam: You can't leave anyone out.",
        "Jim: No one.",
        "Pam: Ok, just get to the good part.",
        "Jim: Ok. Right. Oh, so this morning we are having breakfast together and I just looked up from my cereal and I said, \" You know what I want to do today? I want to marry you.\"",
        "Pam: I had just woken up. I didn't look cute. That's how I knew he meant it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Erin: Michael? Michael sorry to bother you. Are you going to be working down here? Do you want these down here now?",
        "Michael: No work. No work. No work. I come in here to release frustration. Ooh. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ooh.",
        "Erin: Well, I like to swim.",
        "Michael: That's good.",
        "Erin: You have a cool place to come hang.",
        "Michael: If you ever want to come down here, door's always open, lock's broken, so...",
        "Erin: Thanks.",
        "Michael: Come on in. Hey, hey, hey. Here we go. Here we go. Yeah.",
        "Erin: Wow.",
        "Michael: Now you got it.",
        "Erin: Now I do got it.",
        "Michael: Now you got it. Hey, you want some espresso?",
        "Erin: Oh, yeah.",
        "Michael: You gotta keep yourself dehydrated.",
        "Erin: That's rule #1.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Guys, I believe that I have figured out what is up your butts. There's no reason to be scared. The bad man is gone.Charles is gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Charles really did a number on these guys. They are way too focused on work. When I was in charge, this place was like Dave and Buster's People just hanging out, having, fun, eating apps. I don't know. It's like [pause] Dave died or something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Daddy's here and daddy is going to take care of you.",

        "Pam: What?",
        "Michael: Funk is the problem and the solution.",
        "Jim: That makes sense.",
        "Michael: I've taken my downstairs office and I have turned it into a place to hang out. A place where unattractive and attractive people can get together. To meet. To greet. To see the ones that you love. To love the ones that you see.",
        "Oscar: Is this our punishment for not wanting to have lunch with you?",
        "Michael: Why don't you get over lunch, Oscar? Everybody else is past it.",
        "Dwight: [Jack Nicholson impression] All work and no play makes Michael a dull boy.",
        "Meredith: This is like a haunted coffeehouse thing?",
        "Michael: No. Dwight is confusing you. That - it's, it's more of a disco.",
        "Andy: It's like a haunted disco.",
        "Michael: ... with coffee but without the haunted.",
        "Phyllis: It's a combo dance house coffee bar.",
        "Michael: It's a daytime disco on the ground floor of and industrial office building.",
        "Erin: It's a cafe disco.",
        "Michael: Exactly.",
        "Kevin: So, like, a disco cafe?",
        "Michael: Wha - No. No. Not even close. I can't force you to go down but I can entice you. I'm gonna be down there. Erin will be down there from time to time... and all-you-can-eat espresso.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Well, Kevin, I guess it is just me and you.",
        "Kevin: Yeah.",
        "Michael: Holdin' down the fort.",
        "Kevin: Yeah. This place is great.",
        "Michael: Thank you.",

        "Jessica: It's pretty important. He wouldn't want to be disturbed. Can I give him a message before he gets off?",

        "Michael: I know. I know, Angela. A lot of people doubted Cafe Disco at first but it is a magical place. You have to give it a chance. If these walls could tale they would say, \" This is a magical place! You are safe here. We have talking walls. We're not going to eat you.\" [Angela shows Michael the papers again] No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
