    "Recap": [
        "Dwight arrives late for an early morning meeting, where Michael announces that the members of the sales staff are teaming up for sales calls in an Amazing Race -esque challenge. Andy spends the day trying to convince Michael that Dwight is untrustworthy. Meanwhile, Kevin announces to Angela that their quarterly tax reports weren't received in New York, but Angela assures him that the problem was handled. When the teams return, Andy discovers that Dwight's morning tardiness was due to delivering the reports to New York for Angela. Dwight, instead of revealing their relationship, resigns his position."

        "Kevin: Angela.",
        "Angela: What?",
        "Kevin: That was a voicemail that corporate left last night. They did not get our tax forms. Did you send them?",
        "Angela: They arrived this morning.",
        "Kevin: Are you sure? It is a big deal.",
        "Angela: Is it a big deal? Is it Kevin?",
        "Kevin: ... Do you really not know? Because it is a big deal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: Five of us transferred from Stamford. There are two of us left. Me and Karen. It's like we are touring Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory and dropping off one by one. Well, guess what? I am not falling in a chocolate river.",

        "Angela: Everything ok? [Takes candy from Pam's desk]",
        "Dwight: Everything is fine. You are in the clear.",
        "Angela: Thank you. [Puts candy back] I... I don't want those.",

        "Michael: Dwight, care to join us, finally? Thank you.",
        "Andy: Hey Dwight, pass the tardy sauce. Get it Michael?",
        "Michael: Yes. Ok, here is the dream team. My sales dream team. Today we are going to team up for sales calls. Andy, since this was your idea, you get to pick first.",
        "Andy: Hmmm, well... let me think about this for a minute. Oh, I don't know. Michael Scott.",
        "Michael: Oh.",
        "Andy: Ph. D. Doctor of Sales.",
        "Michael: Well, I appreciate that. That is very gracious of you.",

        "Michael: Good. Next up, Superfly himself, Stanley.",
        "Stanley: Pass.",

        "Michael: So that just leaves Dwight and Jim.",
        "Dwight: Ok, wait. Does anyone want to trade?",
        "Jim: Yup. I'll trade.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: Dwight and I used to go on sales calls all the time. In fact, I have a picture to remember that time. Oh young Jim. There is just so much I need to warn you about. And yet, tragically, I cannot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: Sebring by Chrysler. Heck of a... motor... carriage.",
        "Michael: Dwight?",
        "Dwight: Yup?",
        "Michael: Here ya go. [throws laundry]",
        "Dwight: Yeah! You want shirts on hangers?",
        "Michael: Please.",
        "Andy: He does your laundry?",
        "Michael: Long story. All right everybody, circle up. Here we go. You know what this is? This is the \"Amazing Race.\" [To Ryan and Stanley] And you guys are the retired marines. [To Phyllis and Karen] And you guys are the mother and daughter. [To Dwight and Jim] And you guys are the gay couple. And we are the firefighter heroes. Are we ready to go?",
        "Karen: Wait, \"Amazing Race\" like, the biggest sale wins?",
        "Michael: No, we're just going to rush out, do the sales thing, and come back.",
        "Ryan: Is there a prize?",
        "Michael: Just bragging rights.",
        "Phyllis: Then how is this \"Amazing Race\"?",
        "Michael: It's just... brrrrrr... It's \"Amazing Race,\" Phyllis. Okay? We're in teams of two and we are on a mission. All right, so, on your mark, get set, go. Let's do it.",
        "Dwight: Come on!!",
        "Phyllis: Michael. [Michael throws Phyllis' keys under the car.]",

        "Andy: Bueno.",
        "Phyllis: Do you have a pole?",
        "Karen: Let's go get a broom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: Seriously? You're going to sit in the back?",
        "Dwight: Uh, yeah. It's the safest part of the car. In the event of a crash, the driver always protects his side of the car first.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Here we go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: In order to take down Dwight, I have to chip away at his ally, which, in this case, is Michael. Here's the good news. Every success I've ever had at my job or with the lady-folk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: What's the deal with Dwight doing your laundry?",
        "Michael: Ugh... that is a long story. Um, couple of months ago, Dwight tried to go behind my back with Jan and get my job and I am now having him do my laundry as punishment.",
        "Andy: Wow, that is a long story, but quite well told, Michael. I find it very interesting. Especially about the part Dwight going behind your back and basically, like, being a terrible person. You know if you want your laundry done right? I used to work at Abercrombie. So, pretty good folder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Angela: Hey Pam. Would you like to go with me to grab a coffee?",
        "Pam: Really?",
        "Angela: Yeah, I could use some fresh air. Might be fun.",
        "Pam: Ok. Sure.",
        "Angela: Ok.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Karen: Why are we turning in here, this is a beauty salon?",
        "Phyllis: Um-hmmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ryan: Hey, do you mind if I take the lead on this one and then you can critique me after?",
        "Stanley: You want the lead?",
        "Ryan: Yeah, if you don't mind.",
        "Stanley: Mind? Nothing would delight me more.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: Leave the keys.",
        "Jim: You still do that thing?",
        "Dwight: Leave the keys!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: I think you have assembled an amazing team at Scranton. It's really a pleasure to be a part of it. It's like, everyone has their own special skill, you know, just like the Superfriends. Except for Dwight, who is more like a SuperDud. I mean, he would be a Superfriend if there was a Superfriend whose super power was always being late. You know?",
        "Michael: Hawkman.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: My plan is taking longer than I thought but I don't give up easily. I have walked two marathons.",
        "Michael: [Walks out of the Ladies' Restroom] Let's go. The men's room was disgusting.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: After you sir.",
        "Dwight: No thank you, I never let anyone walk behind me. Seven out of ten attacks are from the rear.",
        "Jim: Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will attack you from the front.",
        "Dwight: Uh, yeah, but it will be easier to stop. I can always block the blow. I can counter it with... [Jim slaps Dwight]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Angela, you seem so happy. I bet you wish you were like this all the time.",
        "Angela: This friend of mine - let's call her Noelle - she missed this deadline turning something in to Corporate in New York. But then this gallant gentleman - we'll call him Kurt - he drove all the way to New York and handed it in for her. That's... I don't know. I guess he really just likes her a lot.",
        "Pam: That's great.",
        "Angela: Yes, it is. [Walks up to the counter where there is no employee] Hello?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Hey, did you catch that up at Lake Wallenpaupack?",
        "Buyer: Yep.",
        "Michael: You know, I used to go up there all the time with my step-dad, and I never caught anything that big.",
        "Andy: Caught an eighty-pound shark off of Montauk. It's in the Hamptons. My dad's got a 42-ft Bayliner. Sniped it with a rifle from the crow's nest. Also shot a deer once.",
        "Michael: You know what? Let's get right down to it. Dunder-Mifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse, but what we lack in flash, we will make up for with hardwork and decency.",
        "Andy: Ok, this is the classic undersell because you should know we don't work out of a log cabin. We trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Ever heard of it? It's in New York.",
        "Buyer: Uh, I have to say I am a little wary with getting involved with a big company. We've had some problems in the past.",
        "Michael: I think what Andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company, we will give you the care and attention of a small company.",
        "Andy: Oh, man, that is, like, poetry.",
        "Michael: No.",
        "Andy: I swear, this guy could sell paper to a tree.",
        "Michael: Stop it. [Puts his hand on Andy's shoulder] Stop it.",
        "Andy: Ow.",

        "Michael: Yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: I... I'm so sorry man. I really screwed that up.",
        "Michael: Ah, no. Don't worry about it.",
        "Andy: I really 'Schruted' it.",
        "Michael: What?",
        "Andy: 'Schruted' it. It's just this thing that people say around your office all the time. Like, when you screw something up in a really irreversible way, you 'Schruted' it. I don't know where it comes from though. Do you think it comes from Dwight Schrute?",
        "Michael: I don't know. Who knows how words are formed.",

        "Phyllis: It's a big order. Thanks Kenny.",
        "Karen: Yeah, thank you.",

        "Man: We'll I appreciate what you guys are saying but it, uh, makes more fiscal sense to go with one of the big guys.",

        "Michael: He didn't say.",
        "Andy: That's weird. Because I was just walking past his desk and I saw this, which is a tollbooth receipt from New York City, stamped really early this morning. So, why would Dwight go to New York without telling anyone? Do you think he went to see Jan? That's not like him. Is it? Someone told me a story about this, with, like, laundry and betrayal. Did you betray Dwight and try to steal his job or something?",

Although I love this company more than almost anything in the world, I have decided to step down from my post and spend more time with my family. I do not fear the unknown and I will meet my new challenges head-on and I will succeed. And I will laugh in the faces of those who doubt me. It has been a pleasure working with some of you and I will not forget those of you soon but remember, while today it is me, we all shall fall. In other words, I am quitting. So... .",
