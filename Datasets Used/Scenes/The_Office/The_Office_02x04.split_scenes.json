        "Michael: Okay. Yes! It was a trick question.",
        "Dwight: Yeah, but look, I mean, he didn't need business school. Okay, Michael comes from the school of hard knocks.",
        "Michael: Okay, Dwight.",
        "Dwight: Self taught. You didn't even go to college.",
        "Michael: You know what, Dwight? You don't need to help me here. Okay? Well, you know... Maybe you should go to business school like Ryan, then... then you'd know what you're talking about.",
        "Dwight: [scoffs] Come on. I'm studying with the master, huh?",
        "Michael: For instance, why don't you go to business...",

        "Michael: Stop. Dwight. You know what? You're acting like a dork. Would you cool it? Please. Okay. Hey! He's not your five year old brother, Dwight. He's a valued member of this company... and you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will.",
        "Dwight: Stupid!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: I did not go to business school. You know who else didn't go to business school? LeBron James, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant. They went right from high school to the NBA. So... so it's not the same thing. At all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Look at this stuff. Market fragments. What is that supposed to be?",
        "Ryan: It's a way of looking at consumers as subsets of a larger client base.",
        "Michael: You are so smart. You are so eff-in' smart. You should be teaching me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Ryan: Maybe we should get some air.",
        "Michael: Nah, I'm okay.",

        "Jim: He does?",
        "Dwight: Yeah, it's all him and Michael talk about anymore.",
        "Pam: You know, I bet Ryan thinks to himself 'I wish I were a volunteer sheriff on the weekends'.",
        "Dwight: He doesn't even know that I do that.",
        "Pam: You should tell him.",
        "Dwight: Oh yeah, Pam. Right. That's going to help things, just talk it out. I hope the war goes on forever and Ryan gets drafted.",
        "Pam: Dwight.",
        "Jim: What?",
        "Dwight: I'm sorry I said that, I didn't... just part of me meant it. Besides, he'd end up being a hero anyway.",
        "Jim: You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them.",
        "Dwight: Oh Jim, I'm not going to quit. Then Ryan wins.",
