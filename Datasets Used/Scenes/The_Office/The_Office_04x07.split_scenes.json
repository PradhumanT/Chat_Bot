    "Recap": [
        "When Jan, now living with Michael in his condominium, forces costly changes in Michael's life, he worries about his financial situation. To remedy the problem, Michael leaves work early for a late night job as a telemarketer until 1 a.m. When Ryan finds out, he forces Michael to quit, who then fears that there is no way in which he can support Jan and himself. He hops a train to run away, but Jan meets him and tells him that they can work together to find a way to live. Meanwhile, Dwight pines over Angela, who is later asked out by Andy. After a pep-talk by Jim, Dwight returns as his normal annoying self, to Jim's pleasure. Pam and Jim visit Dwight's family farm, which he has fashioned into a bed and breakfast ."

Yes, we have availability on those nights. How many in your party? Oh no, I'm sorry, no king beds. No queen either. Well, we make our own mattresses that don't conform to the traditional sizes.

        "Dwight: It is not a B and B.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: Agrotourism is a lot more than a bed and breakfest. It consists of tourists coming to a farm, showing them around, giving them a bed, giving them brekafest.",

        "Dwight: How many in your party?",

In the Schrute family, we have a tradition, where when the male has s*x with another woman, he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats left on his door step by his parents. You can use these oats to make oatmeal, bread, whatever you want. I don't care, they're your oats.",

Well, what if I told you that I have a pill that will make you 50 pounds lighter in 5 minutes? How does that sound? Amazing right? Well, it won't be that fast, but it will--[notices camera]-- it will be that easy.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: I just love sales. I love it to death. It's as simple as that. And I don't get to do it enough as a manager, so I took this second job. I count it as a hobby. Some people have golf, or relaxing.",
        "Nick: What's going on here?",
        "Michael: Hey, I just got off the phone, and I was gonna make another call.",
        "Nick: We're a legit operation with a license from the city I can show you. We pay minimum wage against commision---",

        "Dwight: Here we are, the Irrigation Room! A very special room. So I'll come get you before the table-making demonstration. And as of this morning, we are completely wireless here in Schrute Farms. But as soon as I find out where Mose hid all the wires, we'll get that power back on. All righty.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: You know, I've just realized, this is Pam's and my first night away together. I use to play it over my head, and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a uh, nice hotel. Or a romantic dinner. Wine... uh but, wine that wasn't made out of beets. Didn't think Dwight would be involved at all. And uh, I always imagined less manure. I mean, some manure, just... less.",
        "Dwight: Mose, what are you doing? No Mose! Put the--- Put the manure down! Put it down! Do not throw it! DO NOT THROW IT! Ow!",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Just dial the number on the sheet and stick to the script. Say those words exactly, got it? I don't know why we have to keep on having this conversation.",
        "Michael: Look, I know sales, and I had that sale, I just needed a few more minutes---",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: [reading to Jim, Pam, and Mose] And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand, and felt Voldemort's surge of vicious anger. Saw the frail old man on the floor write in agony. \"Harry?\" It was over quickly as it had come. Harry stood shaking in the darkness, clutching the gate in the garden, his heart racing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: What did you get tonight?",
        "Vikram: Oh it looks like mixed masala, eggplant, and rice.",
        "Michael: Oh, that looks good.",

        "Michael: Wonder what I would've been back home?",
        "Vikram: Well this is your home.",
        "Michael: I know, but it's competitive here. What's a dollar worth in your land? Medical school must cost like 40 bucks or a donkey or something.",
        "Vikram: Uhh, no.",
        "Michael: I would've been chief of surgery... Or a cowboy.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: You know what, here's the thing about Die Hard 4. Die Hard one, the original, John McClane was just this normal guy. You know, he's just a normal New York City cop, who gets his feet cut, and gets beat up. But he's an everyday guy. In Die Hard 4, he is jumping a motorcycle into a helicopter. In air. You know? He's invincible. It just sort of lost what Die Hard was. It's not Terminator.",
        "Co-Worker 2: Dude, you should review movies. [other co-workers agree]",
        "Michael: I actually wrote a movie.",
        "Co-Worker 3: Really?",
        "Michael: I'm writing one, yeah.",
        "Co-Worker 3: What's it about?",
        "Michael: Um, sort of a spy, thriller...",
        "Nick: What's so captivating? [everyone stops talking, go back to work] I like captivating things. And this must be really captivating because it's keeping you off the phones. I mean time is your money, that's how I know how captivating it is. Because how much time you spend talking.",

        "Michael: Thanks, no, I have work tomorrow morning.",
        "Co-Worker 2: All right, next time dude.",
        "Michael: Okay, see you guys. [Sees Jan] Hey, how you doin'?",
        "Jan: You drive, I had too much wine.",

        "Ryan: Okay, Michael, why dont you start us off?",
        "Michael: Um... that wasn't much of an introduction.",
        "Ryan: Ladies and gentlemen, your boss, Michael Scott.",
        "Michael: Ahh, still lame. Okay. All right. Thank you, Ryan, for that wonderful introduction. Okay, um, today we're gonna be talking... about...PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Yes I forgot about Ryan's presentation. And yes, it would have been nice to do well with the first presentation he had given me. But you know what else would have been nice? Winning the lottery.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: And the best way to start is to hit start. And up comes the toolbar, that's what she said. What we have to do here is go to Run, and then you look up to PowerPoint. And we are in. We are going to register. You hit register--- Updates are ready. I should update. Um, estimated time 12 minutes, so this should take 5 or 10 minutes.",
        "Ryan: Is this the first time you ever opened PowerPoint?",
        "Michael: Why?",
        "Ryan: You didn't prepare a presentation at all, did you?",
        "Michael: No, I had a really rough night, and my boss can back you up on that.",
        "Ryan: I'm your boss.",
        "Michael: My other boss, Mr. Figaro.",
        "Ryan: You have another job?",

        "Jim: Are you a cocktail waitress?",
        "Ryan: You can not have another job if it affects your work here.",
        "Michael: It won't.",
        "Ryan: It did, all ready.",
        "Michael: Okay, honestly, it was unlikely I was gonna figure this out anyways. [Kelly laughs]",
        "Kelly: You're so funny.",
        "Ryan: Why is Darryl here? He works in the warehouse.",
        "Kelly: I invited him.",
        "Ryan: It's not a party. Darryl, back downstairs, this isn't information you need.",
        "Darryl: There's information here? Yeah, you're right, I don't need this.",
        "Kelly: Okay. [makes out with Darryl]",

        "Kelly: Umm, see you later tonight.",
        "Darryl: I have plans later.",
        "Kelly: Okay, bye honey.",
        "Ryan: How long until you actually get this presentation ready?",
        "Michael: Why don't you do the presentation, because you know how to do it?",
        "Ryan: You know what I really want? Honestly Michael, is for you to know it, so you can communicate to the people here, to your clients, to whomever.",
        "Michael: Huh, okay.",
        "Ryan: What?",
        "Michael: It's whoever, not whomever.",
        "Ryan: No, it's whomever.",
        "Michael: No, whomever is never actually right.",
        "Jim: No, sometimes its right.",
        "Creed: Michael is right. It's a made-up word used to trick students.",
        "Andy: No. Actually, whomever is the formal version of the word.",
        "Oscar: Obviously it's a real word, but I don't know when to use it correctly.",
        "Michael: Not a native speaker.",
        "Kevin: I know what's right, but I'm not gonna say, because you're all jerks who didn't come see my band last night.",
        "Ryan: Do you really know which one is correct?",
        "Kevin: I don't know.",
        "Pam: It's 'whom' when it's the object of a sentence, and 'who' when it's the subject.",
        "Phyllis: Yeah, that sounds right.",
        "Michael: Well it sounds right, but is it?",
        "Stanley: How did Ryan use it? As an object?",
        "Ryan: As an object.",
        "Kelly: Ryan used me an object.",
        "Stanley: Is he right about that?",

        "Mr. Figaro: Are you quitting?",
        "Michael: I am.",
        "Mr. Figaro: Come back anytime, don't forget to disinfect your headset.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: I was never in this for the money. But it turns out that the money was an absolute necessity for me. I tried to live the dream. I tried to have a job, a girlfriend, another job, and I failed. But the good thing about the American dream is that you can just go to sleep, and try it all again the next night.",

        "Pam: What moves?",
        "Andy: I have moon-walked past accounting like ten times.",
        "Pam: I can't believe that's not working.",
        "Andy: Yeah.",
        "Pam: Um, I don't know if I really see you two together.",

        "Pam: Okay, well she takes her convictions pretty seriously, she can be kind of severe.",

        "Michael: Yeah, I was thinking about doing some gambling myself. You know, just a little bit of money. Maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times. I don't know, kind of just for fun. I was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things. Like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight, you know, like, like he's tied into some crooked dealings, maybe his kid is sick or something. Like, who do I call about that?",

        "Michael: Oh, that's the Muppet Show, on DVD, classic.",
        "Oscar: Twelve hundred dollars. What's a Core Blaster Extreme?",
        "Michael: That is by far the best way to strengthen your core. This machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball, you put your feet into the power stir-ups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod, and you twist, and you twist, and you twist. It strengthens your entire core. Your back core, your arm core, the Marine Core actually uses it. I think that's how they got a core.",

        "Oscar: The red bar is what you spend on non-essentials, like magazines, entertainment, things like that.",
        "Michael: Right.",
        "Oscar: This scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever, ever needs, like multiple magic sets, professional bass fishing equipment.",

        "Michael: No you're not! Ok, just... you're not a tool. Look, we'll tell her that it's bad, but it could've been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work I was able to cut it in half.",

        "Jim: Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldn't take it. I mean, I lost it Dwight. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate on anything. Even weird stuff, like food had no taste. So my solution was to move away. It was awful. It was something that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, and that includes you.",

I mean, no matter how badly I treat you, or what I'm going through, you just, you are there for me. And that is a guy worth staying beside. So, where's this train taking us?",
