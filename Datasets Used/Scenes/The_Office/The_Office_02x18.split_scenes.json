        "Pam: I'm looking forward to 'Take Your Daughter to Work' day. I am not great with kids, but I wanna get better. Because I'm getting married. So, I put out a bunch of extra candy out on my desk so the kids will come talk to me. ...Like the witch in Hanzel and Gretel.",

        "Michael: Listen, I like kids. But this is not a kid's environment. This is like HBO, no limits. Who knows what I'm going to say? Crazy stuff. And it is R rated, it is not rated G. I am like Eddie Murphy in \"Raw,\" and they are trying to make me into Eddie Murphy in \"Daddy Daycare.\" both great movies, but, still.",

        "Michael: Yeah, middle school's amazing. It is extraordinary. An extraordinary time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: It's not that children make me uncomfortable, it's just that, why be a dad when you can be a fun uncle? I've never heard of anyone rebelling against their fun uncle.",

        "Michael: [while Jake is throwing things at Michael] They want how many spiral pads?",

        "Jim: Pfft. So have I. Hey, question. If you had to spend a night in the Met or the Aquarium, which would it be?",
        "Abby: Definitely the Aquarium.",
        "Jim: Definitely. Yes. Glad you said that. ...You don't want to help me with some of my sales, do you? 'Cause, I'm kind of swamped.",

Yes, I promise. ...Hello, can I help you? ... You can pick that up, if you want. That's--- that's alright. [Sasha moves the train to Michael's desk] Want to bring it over... here, make some room. My name's Michael. What's your name?",
        "Sasha: Sasha.",
        "Michael: Nice to meet you.",
        "Sasha: Ooh! [picks up train whistle]",
        "Michael: Oh, you know what that is! That is a train whistle, like I'm the conductor. [blows into whistle] But I'm sort of the conductor of the office here, right? [blows into whistle] You want to try?",

        "Dwight: [plays the recorder] That was Greensleeves. A traditional English Ballad about the beheaded Anne Boleyn. And now, a very special treat... a book my Grandmutter used to read me when I was a kid. This is a very special story, it's called Struwwelpeter, by Heinrich Hoffman from 1864. [reading from book] The great tall tailor always comes to little girls that suck their thumbs--- are you listening, Sasha? Right? And 'ere they dream when he's about, he takes his great sharp scissors out, and then cuts their thumbs clean off!",
        "Michael: Dwight! Dwight!",
        "Dwight: There's a photo...",
        "Michael: What the hell are you reading to them?",
        "Dwight: These are cautionary tales for kids, my Grandmata used to read these---",
        "Michael: Yeah, you know what? No, no no no no. They, no. The kids don't want to hear some wierdo book that your Nazi war criminal grandmother gave you.",
        "Sasha: What's a Nazi?",
        "Michael: What's a Nazi?",
        "Dwight: [standing up] Nazi was a fascist movement...",
        "Michael: Don't!",
        "Dwight: ...from the 1930's...",
        "Michael: Don't! Don't! Don't talk about Nazis in front of--- you know what? They're going to have nightmares, so why don't you just shut it?",
        "Dwight: I was gonna teach the children how to make corn-husk dolls.",

        "Dwight: ...Okay.",
        "Jake: Bye, Mister Poop.",

        "The Kids: [raising hands] I do, I do!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Children cannot lie. They are innocent, and they speak the truth, and out of the mouths of babes, Michael Scott is freaking cool. [cracks up]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Angela: You know, I never misbehaved in front of my father because he was a very strict disciplinarian. I can only hope my mate has some of those same qualities [makes eye contact with Dwight].",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: This is where the magic happens! Right over here, let me show you this. See all these? [pets shelf of paper] You know what that is? That's paper. This is where paper comes from. Any questions?",
        "Melissa: So... you cut the paper and dye it and stuff.",
        "Michael: No, we don't actually cut the paper. That's a good question. The paper is sent to us cut, and dyed, from a paper manufacturer, and then we sell it to a business for more than we paid for it.",
        "Abby: That's not fair. [the rest of the kids agree]",
        "Michael: Yes it is, well, w-w--you need someone in the middle to facilitate...",
        "Jake: You're just a middleman.",
        "Michael: I'm not just a middle... man...",
        "Melissa: Wait, why doesn't the saw mill just sell paper directly to people?",
        "Michael: You are describing Office Depot, and they're kind of running us out of business.",
        "Dwight: We have better service than they do!",
        "Michael: ...There's Creed! Let's take a look at what he's doing, everybody! This is Creed, and he is in charge of... something. Right?",
        "Creed: That is correct.",
        "Michael: Say hi to the kids.",
        "Creed: Hi kids.",
        "Michael: Yaaaaay.",
        "Creed: Have you ever seen a foot with four toes? [begins untying shoe]",
        "Kids: Ewwww!",
        "Michael: What are you doing? N--stop it! Stop it! Just--no, no, no, no! No! Would you cut it out?! What is your problem?",
        "Creed: Th-the hair covers it, mostly.",
        "Michael: No no no, we're not gonna see--- we're not gonna see the four toed... Creed, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: You know, there's something interesting about me you might want to know. I ... used to be ... the star of a kids show.",
        "Kids: No way.",
        "Michael: It's true. I did.",
        "Melissa: You serious?",
        "Jake: Really?",
        "Michael: I am totally serious. There was a show called 'Fundle Bundle' and I was the star.",
        "Abby: That doesn't sound like a show.",
        "Melissa: What?!",
        "Michael: It's true! I can prove it! I can prove it, watch this. [gets up and runs out] Ryan, can you come here a second? [clears throat] I would like you to go to my mother's house in Dickson city, and if she is in the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked, I want you to boost yourself up, I want you to go down to the basement. In the basement is a tape labeled 'Fundle Bundle'. I want you to grab it, I want you to get my guitar.",
        "Ryan: Right. Okay.",
        "Michael: I want you to get the tambourine. Do you know how to play the tambourine?",
        "Ryan: Um, I'm already getting the pizzas from Bernetti's, so...",
        "Melissa: You know, I can go with him.",
        "Michael: Oka--",
        "Ryan: No! I will... go.",
        "Michael: Okay! Thank you Ryan. Good attitude, hottest in the office.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: [to Abby] Alright, nowwww... what kind... of pizza do you like?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: I don't get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids. You joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives... They're adults, for God's sake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: I am going to give you a little blast from the past of Michael Gary Scott when he was a child star, and a show that you might remember called 'Fundle Bundle.' Okay? Without further ado, Ryan?",
        "Miss Trudy: [from TV] ...Bundle, are you ready to come on in? [TV children cheer] Let's have some fun!",
        "Michael: That... is Miss Trudy. Can't tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body. Okay, you can... fast forward. And... I want you... to...",
        "Dwight: Is that a real fun shooting windmill?",
        "Michael: Stop! Stop! Stop! [Ryan resumes the tape] Yes! That is, uh, Edward R. Meow.",
        "Jim: That's pretty funny.",
        "Michael: Yeah.",
        "Edward R. Meow: ...Recess! Hey, what's your name?",
        "Chet: My name's Chet.",
        "Edward R. Meow: Well hi Chet.",
        "Oscar: Is that Chet Montgomery?",
        "Michael: Uhh, I don't know.",
        "Pam: That is!",
        "Darryl: Checkin' in with Chet. Doppler's up.",
        "Edward R. Meow: What do you want to be when you grow up?",
        "Chet: I want to be on TV!",
        "Dwight: [employees chuckle] And he is on TV now!",
        "Michael: Can everyone please shut up, please! So you don't miss it.",
        "Edward R. Meow: Okay, next? So, whats your name?",
        "Michael: Oh! That's me. Shh. Shh.",

        "Michael: I do okay.",
        "Melissa: Was Chet Montgomery cool back then?",
        "Michael: Yes.",
        "Jake: Even I have a girlfriend.",
        "Michael: Okay! Alright, okay.",
        "Sasha: So you didn't get to be what you wanted to be.",
        "Michael: ...I guess not... you know, I have a load of work to do so I am going to grab a slice of this delish pizza... and I'm going to go do my work. Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: He's not coming out. He won't pick up the phone.",
        "Jim: Can't believe his mom dressed him like that, that's the real tragedy.",
        "Roy: [wrestling with Jake] Pam! Pam! I love this guy! [laughs] Come on!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: So, Melissa... I met your mom a couple times. She's so nice.",

        "Dwight: Well at least I'm not a horrible little latchkey kid who got suspended from school. So...",
        "Jake: Meredith!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: [Toby knocks on door] Yeah?",
        "Toby: I think these belong to you. [puts toys down on desk]",
        "Michael: Oh, that's okay, she can keep those.",
        "Toby: Believe me, she has enough toys... she doesn't need your watch.",
        "Michael: Thank you.",
        "Toby: Is everything okay?",
        "Michael: You have to ask me that because you work for human resources.",
        "Toby: Uh... it's true...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Well, sure, playing the field is great, don't get me wrong, but there's more to life than notches just on my bedpost.",
        "Toby: Mmhmm.",
        "Michael: Tell me something honestly, do you... think... that it is too late for me to have kids?",
        "Toby: Well, you need a wife first, or at least a girlfriend.",
        "Michael: What about...",
        "Toby: Not Jan.",

        "Michael: ...Or biologically.",
        "Toby: Somehow.",

        "Pam: You're welcome.",
        "Jake: Is your job hard?",

        "Pam: Really?",
        "Jake: Yeah.",
        "Pam: Okay. Um... here it is. Don't put your fingers in there. [shreds paper] Cool huh?",
