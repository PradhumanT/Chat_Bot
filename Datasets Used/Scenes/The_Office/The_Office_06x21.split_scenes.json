        "Michael: Gets to go home. [everyone starts to do push-ups] Ooh! I say 'dance,' they say 'how high?' Here we go. Oh, no. No, no, no. Butt to high. [steps on Angela] Disqualified!",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oscar: Essentially, what we have here is one of those stories where a mother lifts a car to save her baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Well, it's not exactly fair. He's got all of his weight that's helping him go down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: 25. Yeah! Come on, you can do it!",
        "Phyllis: One more, one more! [cheers and applause]",

        "Oscar: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oscar: Yeah, we talked this morning and we talked at Christmas. So, a little momentum there. [tries to open door, locked] Just a couple of hours to kill before work.",

        "Darryl: Hey, what's up?",
        "Oscar: Hey, nice office.",

        "Darryl: Has that ever happened? Ever?",
        "Oscar: Didn't we? I think we did.",
        "Darryl: You want me to invite Matt?",
        "Oscar: Yeah, the whole gang, Matt included.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phyllis: Yeah, I love going to bars with Bob. I tend to wear something low-cut, get men to flirt with me, and Bob beats 'em up. What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: A bunch of us are talking about happy hour.",
        "Jim: I would love, love, love to go. Only problem is, Pam's at home with the baby and I think she wants a night in.",
        "Andy: Oh, baloney.",
        "Jim: Good one.",
        "Andy: Ring her up.",
        "Jim: Absolutely, I will do that right now.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: Erin, I need you to fax this and get me a confirmation, pronto. [whispering] Are you going later?",

        "Erin: Talk to me that way again, and I'll cut your face off.",
        "Andy: Whoa.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: We recently struck up a romantic relationship. And, um... but we're kinda keeping it quiet for now 'cause it's still kind of a new thing. It's a little delicate, and we just don't want all the drama.",
        "Erin: Exactly.",
        "Andy: Yeah, cause when everyone knows- [knock on window, open blinds to Kevin giggling and making sexual gestures] That's actually pretty funny, but in general, you know.",

        "Pam: Yeah!",
        "Kevin: Waaah! [starts to make crying baby noises]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: When a new mom hears a baby cry, her you-know-what's fill up with you-know-what, and then her shirt gets, you know... that would be funny.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Oh, wow, I cannot believe this is happening. This is everything I dreamed. Oh, my God! [laughs]",
        "Jim: Easy.",

        "Michael: Sucks to be you.",
        "Jim: Would you like to be our fourth?",
        "Michael: That would be sublime.",
        "Jim: All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Darryl: So, the guy shows me the deck he's built. And I'm like, 'I'll call this a deck if it'll make you happy, but this is just a porch without a roof.' [laughter, Oscar looks toward door] It was ridiculous man, it was like-you could maybe get two chairs on the thing. Two lawn chairs.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Hey, Michael.",
        "Michael: Yes.",
        "Pam: This is my friend Julie.",
        "Michael: Hello, how are you?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julie: So you work with Pam and Jim?",
        "Michael: Oh, no, no. Pam and Jim work for me. And if they win, they are fired.",
        "Julie: [giggles] I should hope not.",
        "Michael: No. No, not really. Not really, but they better not win.",
        "Isabel: Hey.",
        "Pam: Hey, Isabel, you made it. Oh, my goodness.",
        "Isabel: Of course.",
        "Pam: You want to play pool?",

        "Pam: Ok.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Angela: And then they said the most ridiculous thing about Anderson Cooper, which I do not have the decency to repeat, but trust me when I tell you that-",
        "Dwight: Hold that thought. Well, well, well. If it isn't Isabel.",
        "Isabel: Mm-hmm.",
        "Dwight: What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?",
        "Isabel: A girl like me is why a guy like you comes to a place like this.",
        "Dwight: Ooh, I love repartee.",
        "Isabel: Do you?",
        "Dwight: Usually means there's a battle scene coming.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: So, what do you do?",
        "Julie: I am an ESL teacher.",
        "Michael: Really?",
        "Julie: Yeah.",
        "Michael: See, I didn't think you could teach that. I thought that was something you were born with. What am I thinking right now?",
        "Julie: Are you thinking that I said 'ESP?'",
        "Michael: Yes. I feel like an idiot. Awesome.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julie: I was a little nervous when Pam told me he was her boss, but he doesn't act like a boss at all. If I had a boss like that, we'd never get anything done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: So what do you think?",
        "Michael: About what?",

        "Hide: My brother, good head, bad heart. Good head, bad heart.",
        "Oscar: I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Hey, Michael, where have you been? [Michael shoots pool ball up into their faces]",
        "Jim: Hey, you're supposed to hit the white ball first, buddy. Nice one. Can I talk to you for a sec? All right. Everything ok?",
        "Pam: Why are you wearing a hat now?",
        "Michael: Guys, come on, I'm on a date. Let me do my thang.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Hi, I'm date Mike. Nice to meet me. How do you like your eggs in the morning? [tries to wink]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: You want to just make a run for it?",
        "Pam: Maybe.",
        "Kevin: Waaaah! [Kevin fake-cries into Pam's chest] Waaaaah! Mommy!",

        "Erin: What's this game?",
        "Ryan: One second.",
        "Andy: Yeah, how do you play?",
        "Ryan: Guys, guys, guys, please. [game ends] Ok, all right, it's all yours now.",
        "Kelly: Only three tickets.",
        "Ryan: If we save 'em up, we can get more than a sticker this time.",
        "Kelly: Stop telling me how to spend my tickets.",
        "Ryan: I know, but you wanted the big thing.",
        "Andy: Wow, can you imagine what people would say if they saw us dancing together?",
        "Erin: Oh I know.",
        "Andy: They'd be like, 'what's up with those two?'",
        "Erin: 'Hey, guys, get a bedroom already.'",
        "Andy: 'Did we miss the wedding?' Um, I got it-I'll do this, and you play the racing game, and then we'll switch.",
        "Erin: Yes, okay. Yeah, that's smart.",
        "Andy: No drama. Ok.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Isabel: Oh, air hockey, basketball, we could play that. Oh, whack-a-mole.",

        "Dwight: Universal donor. [startled by Angela, curses]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: Angela versus Isabel. Height, advantage Isabel. Birthing hips, advantage Isabel. Remaining child-bearing years, advantage Isabel. Legal obligation, advantage Angela.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Hey, guys, guys, guys. [steals a cherry from waitress passing buy] Watch this. Ready?",
        "Julie: What are you doing?",
        "Michael: I'm tying a knot in the stem with my tongue.",
        "Jim: Michael, you don't have to do this.",
        "Michael: [choking] Wow. Oh, wow, that was close.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: I would say I kind of have an unfair advantage because I watch reality dating shows like a hawk, and I learn. I absorb information from the strategies of the winners and the losers. Actually, I probably learn more from the losers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Phyllis: Hey, you two having fun?",
        "Andy: Did you tell them?",
        "Erin: No.",
        "Andy: This is exactly what I don't want, the drama. I don't want the drama!",
        "Erin: I get it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Isabel: [Isabel and Dwight playing whack-a-mole] You are amazing at this. How did you get so good?",

        "Dwight: Extend the fingers more.",
        "Isabel: Whack!",
        "Dwight: Good.",
        "Angela: This looks like a hoot.",
        "Dwight: Hey, monkey, how you doing?",
        "Angela: Whack.",
        "Dwight: Listen, can I talk to you for a second?",
        "Angela: Okay.",
        "Dwight: Look, I've been thinking. We had a good run. We really did. But you don't need to worry about this whole contract thing anymore.",
        "Angela: It's no worry.",
        "Dwight: It's just that we both-we want different things. You know, I want a big family.",
        "Angela: I could see enjoying that.",
        "Dwight: No, no, no, no. I want a big family. Tall. Thick. A big, physically big family. Listen, you go have fun. You're off the hook.",
        "Angela: But we signed the contract.",
        "Dwight: Dissolved. Don't worry, you're free. Okay? Okay. See you later.",
        "Angela: We both-you didn't dup-",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: [Michael playing air guitar on pool table] Wow. Maybe we should tell her that he's not normally like this.",
        "Pam: Maybe it should come from a man.",
        "Jim: Maybe it should come from a note... with flowers...tomorrow.",
        "Bar Manager: Hello.",
        "Michael: Hello.",
        "Bar Manager: Hi.",
        "Michael: Hi.",
        "Bar Manager: You wanna pay 400 bucks to re-felt this table?",
        "Michael: Yeah, why don't you send the bill to 23 I Don't Care Lane, Scranton, Pennsylvania?",
        "Pam: Hey, Michael, why don't you just get down.",
        "Michael: Hey, she can tell I'm on a date, right? Right? I'm just having fun.",
        "Bar Manager: Ted, are we having fun?",
        "Michael: Really? You told on me. That's lame.",
        "Bouncer: We got a problem?",
        "Michael: Yes. Homelessness. What?",
        "Bar Manager: All right, go.",
        "Michael: Where?",
        "Bar Manager: Get out. Now.",
        "Michael: Okay, all right. Okay, whoa. I'm just kidding around. I'm sorry.",
        "Pam: Ok, um, why don't we just finish the game? Michael, it's your shot.",
        "Michael: She can't talk to us that way.",
        "Pam: You guys are stripes, I think...",
        "Michael: You let somebody talk to you like that, where does it stop?",
        "Jim: It stopped.",
        "Michael: Well, I am starting it again!",
        "Pam: Do you guys want some food? The wings are really good here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Hey, you embarrassed my friends in front of me and I'm gonna need you to go back over to the table and apologize.",
        "Bar Manager: Then I am sorry that I didn't kick you out.",
        "Michael: I am here with my employees. I am here on a date. Hello.",
        "Bar Manager: Well, uh, I'm the manager here, sir.",
        "Michael: Well, it just so happens that I am a manager too. And the way I manage people is that I touch their hearts and souls with humor, with love and maybe a dash of razzle-dazzle. And I don't see that from you.",
        "Bar Manager: Is that how you do it?",
        "Michael: Yes it is. I am writing a book about it.",
        "Bar Manager: Really? How much have you written?",
        "Michael: I've written all of it... in my head.",
        "Bar Manager: Oh.",
        "Michael: If you're really interested, it's called 'Somehow I Manage' and there's going to be a picture of me on the cover, shrugging, with my sleeves rolled up.",
        "Bar Manager: Huh. Have you read Lee Iacocca's? It's a classic.",
        "Michael: Read it? I own it. But no, I have not read it.",
        "Bar Manager: Dude, tonight! You're not going to want to put it down. It's gonna make you want to go out and buy a Chrysler tomorrow.",
        "Michael: I own a Chrysler.",
        "Bar Manager: Shut up.",
        "Michael: No, you shut up.",

        "Girl at table: Hi.",
        "Andy: I don't normally do this, but...",
        "Girl at table: Do what?",
        "Andy: Just sit down next to a beautiful woman and start talking to myself to confuse other people.",
        "Erin: [Erin sits with man, rubs her hand on his thigh] Hey, big boy. Do you like it when I do that?",
        "Andy: [Andy spits out his drink] What are you doing?",
        "Erin: What we said to do.",
        "Andy: We didn't say we were gonna, like, start groping strangers!",
