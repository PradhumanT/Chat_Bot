        "Oscar: Yesterday, Angela may or may not have figured out that I'm having an affair with her husband. So I just have to wait and see. When she comes in, if she's cold and awkward and cruel to me, then great, it's business as usual.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oscar: Good morning. [clears throat]",
        "Angela: Oscar... [sighs] can I ask you a question?",
        "Oscar: [whispering] Of course, ask me a que-- questions.",
        "Angela: Is it cool in here to you?",
        "Oscar: [hoarsely] Yes, a little bit. [normal voice] Yes.",
        "Angela: I think the thermostat is acting up again.",
        "Oscar: It's the stupid thermostat! That thing is a catastrophe. So I'm gonna, um, on your suggestion, get someone to fix it. I'll just go downstairs.",
        "Angela: Thank you.",
        "Oscar: No, thank you, Angela.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oscar: She doesn't know. I shouldn't be surprised. This is a woman who married a man who is obviously a homosexual. Basically, she has her head in the sand. In a way I feel sorry for her. I guess the universe rewards true love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: Well, well, well, it's finally happened. Pam has ceased caring.",
        "Pam: These are my painting clothes.I think I'm gonna do it. I am really gonna start painting the warehouse mural today. [Jim applauds]",
        "Meredith: Sure you don't want to put another coat of primer on that Pam?Queen of the primer, that one.",
        "Jim: You got this, Beesley. Actually, do you want me to come down and help you get started?",
        "Pam: Are you avoiding your phone call?",
        "Jim: What? Yeah, right. As if.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: Today I will be asking David Wallace if I can start working part-time, because the sports marketing company that I started really needs me to be there.",
        "Pam: Last week Jim wasn't there, and they named the company Athlead.",
        "Jim: I could have prevented that. So I have to talk to Wallace.",
        "Pam: Tell them your opening line.",
        "Jim: [sighs] Hey David, how would you like a guy who's not here as much, gets paid the same amount of salary, and has bigger fish to fry in Philadelphia?",
        "Pam: I think it's good. He likes fishing.",
        "Jim: This is gonna be awful.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pete: One of my jobs is to input customer complaints into the computer. And when they're in, I fill out one of these cards. But the information's already on the computer, so....why am I filling out the card? I asked Andy, and he told me to \"chillax,\" and then went away on a big, long boat ride. So here we are. Don't give me a pointless office chore, because I will build a little paper house. Fight the power.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Angela: Meet me in the old place, five minutes. I need you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Angela: [upon seeing Dwight naked] Ugh!",
        "Dwight: Come on in, the water's fine.",
        "Angela: Dwight, it's not that kind of meeting. Put your clothes back on.",
        "Dwight: I know. That's not why I'm naked. I always work out without my clothes. [does jumping jacks]",
        "Angela: Just put them on! Put on your clothes. I need your help. I need someone who can operate outside of the law. Ugh.",
        "Dwight: Oh, I'm sorry, your vigilante privileges ended when you broke up with me. If I'm not in your panties, I don't go vigilantes. Why don't you ask your husband?",
        "Angela: My marriage is in danger. I don't know who I can trust. I need someone to be there for me.",
        "Dwight: [sighs] All right, what are we talking? Surveillance, wire-tapping?",
        "Angela: Something like that.",
        "Dwight: Yeah, the less I know, the better. I know just the guy. He was a volunteer sheriff too. Kicked off the force.",
        "Angela: Can you arrange a meeting?",
        "Dwight: I can try. I'm gonna use SMS text.",
        "Angela: Okay.",
        "Dwight: Text went through.",
        "Angela: Okay.",
        "Dwight: All we can do is sit and wait.",
        "Angela: Okay.",
        "Dwight: [phone vibrates] Oh, look at that. Yeah, he's free anytime. Not a problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: I mean, I can handle any client issues from Philly.",
        "David: [on phone] Yeah, but I really need someone in the office. If there's a crisis -- the more I think about it --",
        "Jim: Oh, you mean handle it in person. Oh, well, Phyllis and Stanley have agree to cover for me while I'm gone.",
        "David: They did?",
        "Jim: Yep.",
        "David: Oh, okay. Well, that is different. In that case, yes-- Maybe this can work.",
        "Jim: Oh, great.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stanley: Why should we help you?",
        "Jim: Because we're friends.",
        "Stanley: When is my birthday?",
        "Jim: Unfair. When's my birthday?",
        "Stanley: I don't know, because we're not friends.",
        "Jim: How about this-- You let me take you to lunch, and I make my case?",
        "Stanley: Now we're talkin'.",
        "Jim: All right.",
        "Phyllis: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Make it go taller.",
        "Pete: That's the idea.",
        "Kevin: No, not taller this way, taller this way. [gesturing with hands]",
        "Pete: Well, I've gotta build a wider base first before I can go higher.",
        "Kevin: You're not getting this, Peter. Make it go wider... up!",
        "Pete: Will do.",
        "Darryl: [entering] What are y'all doing?",
        "Kevin: Me and Pete are building a tower.",
        "Darryl: Cool. It should be taller though, right?",
        "Kevin: Obviously. He's a sweet kid, Darryl. But he's not the sharpest guy in the drawer.",
        "Pete: Kevin, I can hear you.",
        "Kevin: Huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Angela: Ow! Dwight! Ow!",
        "Dwight: Get in the van.",
        "Angela: God!",
        "Trevor: Is it safe to talk?",
        "Dwight: Well, this documentary crew has been following our every move for the past nine years, but I don't see them so I think we're good.",
        "Angela: So what are your credentials?",
        "Trevor: I started following people around to get exercise. Turns out, I'm damn good at it.",
        "Angela: Do you have a gun?",
        "Dwight: [snickers] Does he own a gun? Show her.",
        "Trevor: You tell me.",
        "Angela: What is this?",
        "Trevor: It's the receipt for my gun.",
        "Angela: You don't carry it with you?",
        "Trevor: Read the receipt. That's a $300 gun. Someone could steal it.",
        "Dwight: Do you have any idea how many guns Trevor's had stolen from him?",
        "Trevor: Now I keep it in a safe.",
        "Dwight: Mm-hmm. Good safe?",
        "Trevor: Oh, you tell me. [shows Dwight receipt]",
        "Dwight: Wow!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: [studying mural wall] I guess if I make a mistake, I can just paint over it with a shrub or something. It's just, I think less of paintings with a lot of shrubs. So, I'm gonna limit myself to one shrub.",
        "Hide: You paint wall now?",
        "Pam: Yeah. Painting now. I just want to make sure that...",
        "Hide: You paint now.",
        "Pam: It's probably gonna be a few minutes. So you can just go back to doing whatever you were doing.",
        "Hide: I wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meredith: Sweet.",

        "Meredith: Oh OOOH!",
        "Everyone: [approving cheers]",
        "Meredith: Boom!",
        "Darryl: Bang.",
        "Kevin: Yep, yep, yep.",
        "Pete: All right. Up next we got a whole lotta Creed.",
        "Creed: Let's find out what I did.",
        "Pete: All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: You get half now and half upon completion of said job.",
        "Trevor: And that's all off the books?",
        "Angela: Obviously.",
        "Trevor: Nice. No taxes.",
        "Angela: Okay, so everything you need to know about the target is in here.",
        "Trevor: So what's the job?",
        "Angela: Murder.",
        "Trevor: Okay, that's the big one. That's the big \"M.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: You can't have someone murdered.",
        "Angela: What if they deserved it?",
        "Dwight: What did they do to you, Angela?",
        "Angela: They're sleeping with my husband.",
        "Dwight: Oh, Monkey. Oh, I feel for you.",
        "Trevor: This seems a little crazy.",
        "Dwight: Yes. Crazy. Thank you.",
        "Trevor: But I think I'm up for it.",
        "Dwight: No! No!",
        "Angela: Thank you.",
        "Dwight: Absolutely not. There are a lot of different ways to get revenge. I've had great success by defecating in a paper bag, put it on the porch--",
        "Trevor: That's very effective. I've been on the receiving end of that quite a few times. It's devastating.",
        "Angela: No, no, no. It has to be physical. I want this person to suffer.",
        "Trevor: What about a knee-capping?",
        "Dwight: No! You're not helping, Trevor!",
        "Angela: Yes, a knee-capping could work.",
        "Dwight: No. Angela! What are you saying?",
        "Angela: You said you would be there for me.",
        "Dwight: I'm trying, but what you're asking is--",
        "Angela: It's the only thing that will make this right.",
        "Dwight: Okay. But it's cruel, because a woman with damaged knees can't scrub worth a damn.",
        "Trevor: All right, then it's settled. One knee-capping. Now, the hit goes down at 4:00. Keep in mind, once I leave, there's no turning back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: You know, truth be told, I think all you'll really be doing is accepting calls from my clients while I'm gone.",
        "Stanley: We've got all afternoon to talk about that.",
        "Waiter: Morning, folks.",
        "Stanley: I'll have the surf and turf with a side order of lobster.",
        "Waiter: Actually, the surf and turf does come with lob--",
        "Stanley: Not enough lobster. Side order.",
        "Phyllis: How much wine do you have?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oscar: I brought you a cookie.",
        "Angela: Oh, thanks, Oscar. You're such an angel.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oscar: [talking into phone] I just gave her a cookie, and she called me an angel, so... yeah, we're good. Yeah. [exhales] We dodged a bullet, yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah-- Well, I gotta go now, but-- Okay, bye. Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pete: There we go.",
        "Everyone: [cheers and applause]",
        "Pete: Nicely done. Very nicely done. All right, this next one goes to Darryl for pocket dialing a customer while having s*x.",
        "Nellie: Oooohh... you salty dog.",
        "Darryl: Well, yeah, what can I say, a player's gotta play.",
        "Pete: There you go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Darryl: Actually, that was the sound of me eating spaghetti. But I'm gonna let them think the other thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Okay, I got this one.",
        "Nellie: Oh, be careful! Be careful! Be careful",
        "Kevin: No, I got it. Easy does it, everyone. Nobody even take a breath.",
        "Everyone: [shouting as tower collapses] Oh no! Kevin!",
        "Nellie: What did I just say? What did I just say?",
        "Pete: Hey, hey, hey, it's just a mistake. Just a mistake. That's what this tower's all about -- mistakes. Okay, if you're afraid of screwing up, the tower's not for you. Show of hands --- who here has never had a complaint? That's right. Nobody. See that? Nobody. Okay? Let's get back to work, huh? Come on, you in?",
        "Kevin: Yeah.",
        "Pete: There we go. All right, let's do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: You know, at the end of the day, it's really only two days. I mean, I'll be back in the office. If you need me for an emergency, call me. I'll be there...",
        "Phyllis: You know what? I don't know where the years went. 'Cause sometimes when I look at my hands, I don't even recognize them.",
        "Jim: Tell me about it.",
        "Phyllis: Whose hands are these? [holding out her hands to Jim] Theyre not my hands. I don't know.",
        "Jim: All right. You know what? Maybe we'll just... We'll go slow.",
        "Phyllis: No. Jim... [wine bottle clangs on plate]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pete: All right. Check it out.",
        "Everyone: [cheers and applause]",
        "Pete: Like a Phoenix from the ashes. Ksshhhh!",
        "Kevin: Nice. Pretty soon, we're gonna be at the ceiling.",
        "Erin: Whoo!",
        "Pete: Can you hand me a card?",
        "Erin: Um,. it's empty.",
        "Pete: What?",
        "Nellie: Oh, come on. We could use a blank card.",
        "Everyone: No!!",
        "Meredith: That's cheating.",
        "Pam: I could get us a complaint.",
        "Meredith: You? Little Miss Priss? You wouldn't fart on a butterfly.",
        "Pam: No, I wouldn't. I can't even relate to that impulse. But I bet I could get us a customer complaint. I'd like to try.",
        "Nellie: Hmm. Yeah. All right! Yea, go, Pam! Pam...",
        "Everyone: [chanting] \"Pam!\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Angela: What? Why did you call me out here?",
        "Dwight: The target-- it's Oscar, isn't it? He and the senator are gaying each other.",
        "Angela: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Dwight: Your nostrils tell a different story. They flare like that every time you're engaging in deception. Hello again, naughty nostrils.",
        "Angela: Fine! It's Oscar. So what?",
        "Dwight: Well I could understand you wanting to get a stranger's knees whacked. But a co-worker-- Dare I say, a friend?",
        "Angela: Exactly, a friend. Someone who sits next to you year after year, making chitchat and smiling, and all the while running behind your back and defiling your marriage and seducing your husband.",
        "Dwight: I can't even imagine how painful this must be for you. But the first ones to break your marriage vows were you and me.",
        "Angela: Well, you might be right. But it's too late now.",
        "Dwight: What do you mean?",
        "Angela: He's here.",
        "Dwight: No! No, no! [groans]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: Oscar? Oscar. Oscar, good. Hey come with me.",
        "Oscar: What?",
        "Dwight: Come -- come with me.",
        "Oscar: What are you doing?",
        "Dwight: There are a bunch of construction workers in the warehouse without their trousers, drinking diet sodas. You have got to see this. They're extraordinary.",
        "Meredith: Yahtzee.",
        "Trevor: Sandwich delivery for Mr. Oscar Martinez.",
        "Kevin: I am Oscar Martinez.",
        "Angela: No, not him, not him. Outside. Outside.",
        "Kevin: Wha-- wh--",
        "Angela: You know, there's doughnuts in the break room.",
        "Kevin: Nice! Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: Listen, I was really wondering if maybe we could lock this down before lunch is over.",
        "Stanley: Don't be pushy Jim. It's tacky.",
        "Jim: All right. Phyllis! Phyllis, that's-- that's decorative.",
        "Phyllis: No, there's wine in here.",
        "Jim: Still decorative.",
        "Stanley: Is it white wine?",
        "Jim: No.",
        "Phyllis: [to customer] Can you help me?",
        "Jim: Don't-- don't-- don't pole people with knives.",
        "Phyllis: [groaning while trying to open giant wine bottle] ha ha!",
        "Jim: Phyllis! Wow.",
        "Stanley: Ooh, bring it over.",
        "Phyllis: Got it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: There's no time to explain. [descending stairs] Okay, actually, there is time to explain. When Angela found out that you seduced her husband, we hired a guy to break your knee caps.",
        "Oscar: Oh, my God! What is wrong wiht you?",
        "Dwight: What is wrong with you? There are a million gorgeous guys in the Scranton Wilkes-Barre area, and you choose the man who's the father of her child?",
        "Oscar: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Dwight: Oh, don't lie. I'm trying to save those precious knees you're always bragging about. Now, let's get out of here. He could be right behind us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: Aah! Actually, he's right in front of us.",
        "Trevor: Let's get it on. I'm gonna do this. I might-- I might puke, but I'm gonna do this.",
        "Dwight: No, Trevor, I am not gonna let you. He's a Dunder-Mifflin man. He's my tribe.",
        "Trevor: I'm sorry, Dwight, but for once in my stupid, stupid life, I'm gonna follow through on something, all right? I have masculinity issues-- Stop! No!",
        "Oscar: I got it.",
        "Dwight: Disarm!",
        "Trevor: You don't-- [all three grunting]",
        "Dwight: Don't move. And disarm now! [Oscar gets weapon away from others]",
        "Trevor: Okay, okay, okay, okay.",
        "Dwight: No! No, Oscar. He's a friend. He's a friend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Erin: Okay, the client is Heymont Brake and Tire. They're family-owned, but don't let that take away from your edge!",
        "Nellie: Come on, Pam, I know you can fail. I see failure in you.",
        "Creed: Remember, you're a scumbag, so you think scummy thoughts. Like this.",
        "Pam: [into phone] Hello, this is Pam Halpert. I'm calling from Dunder-Mifflin. Yes, your paper provider. And I just called to say... your mama is so fat, when she wears red, people yell, \"Hey, kool-aid.\" Yeah, your mama's fat. This is Pam Halpert.",
        "Pete: Did she buy it?",
        "Pam: Basically I couldn't tell, but I think...",
        "Nellie: Were they angry?",
        "Pam: I-- I thought they were confused at least...",
        "Nellie: Okay.",
        "[phone rings]",
        "Erin: Dunder Mifflin. This is Erin. Yes, you can. Okay. I will make sure that goes on file. [hangs up] Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost a client!",
        "Everyone: [cheering]",
        "Kevin: Nice. Nice.",
        "Creed: You did good. You did good.",
        "Pete: See ya later, Heymont.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: No.",
        "Trevor: If you chase me, I will run so fast. If you catch me I will bite so hard. Got it? Good-bye, my friend.",
        "Oscar: What the hell, Dwight?",
        "Dwight: See ya later, Trevor.",
        "Oscar: you are incorrigible!",
        "Dwight: I just saved your life. You're welcome!",
        "Oscar: You hired someone to hit me with a pipe!",
        "Angela: You deserved every bit of it! You made my husband gay.",
        "Oscar: What-- what I did was wrong, and I have to live with that every day. But your husband is... gay. He was gay when you married him!",
        "Angela: No. No.",
        "Oscar: Angela, until you face that, you're gonna be confused and angry for all the wrong reasons. But if you want to blame me for the whole thing, go ahead -- I won't stop you. Hit me. you have my blessing. Hit me.",
        "Angela: Well are you gonna let go of it? Because part of the blame is definitely on you.",
        "Oscar: Angela, it's a lead freaking pipe.",
        "Angela: God! [kicks Oscar]",
        "Oscar: Aah!",

        "Nellie: Yes!",
        "Pam: I did not know that.",
        "Pete: Well, a woman who struggled with obesity all her life.",
        "Pam: I'm so sorry.",
        "Meredith: Wow.",
        "Pete: yeah. That's-- that is terrible.",

        "Angela: [crying] Jazz is stupid! I mean, just play the right notes!",
        "Dwight: I know. You're gonna be okay, Monkey.",
