        "Pam: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: [Phyllis rocks her chair into his provocatively] Seriously. Ugh. Ok, this is unacceptable. It's officially a hostile work environment.",
        "Phyllis: Why?",
        "Darryl: Somebody just needs to get her attention, tell her it's not OK to do this in public.",
        "Pam: Be careful. I pulled my mom's dog off a pillow once, and I got bit.",
        "Meredith: Just ignore her. Sooner or later she'll finish.",
        "Group: Ugh. Ew.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Dwight: Phyllis is m*st*rb*t*ng. In the office right now as we speak.",
        "Angela: Can we skip the color commentary and just have Andy go out there and fire her?",
        "Toby: He- he can't do that. Turns out she's allowed to have feelings of sexual arousal. It doesn't become a violation until she physically acts on it.",
        "Group: No!",
        "Oscar: Toby, how do you propose that we- Andy:Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Why is Phyllis so aroused?",
        "Pam: She's listening to 50 Shades of Grey.",
        "Andy: Well there you go. That's muy caliente.",
        "Dwight: OK, you are useless. I'll take care of this. [walks out of Andy's office and dumps water on Phyllis]",
        "Phyllis: What the hell?!",
        "Dwight: It's OK guys, she's no longer horny.",
        "Andy: Excuse me, dirty birdie [takes Phyllis' iPod]",
        "Phyllis: Wait, what?",
        "Andy: You can have this back at the end of the day. [cut to Andy listening to the iPod and looking aroused, water is dumped on him] Oh!!",

        "Clark: Oh.",
        "Dwight: [laughs] What do you think?",
        "Clark: The same thing that you think.",
        "Dwight: A long term tractor lease is going to put pressure on a relationship.",
        "Clark: God, one of my buddies is going through the same thing right now. Something in the air.",
        "Angela: Here you go. And good for you Dwight, I'm so glad you found someone. I bet she's got kind eyes.",

        "Jim: What was I gonna- What was I gonna say?",
        "Pam: You're- You know your assistant told me that you have a big pitch meeting today. With Ryan Howard. How did that happen?",
        "Jim: Not that Ryan Howard. Um, the Phillies' first baseman.",
        "Pam: Oh, oh OK.",

        "Oscar: It looks like the camera man was hiding behind the shelves.",
        "Phyllis: Wait. So they were filming all the time? Even when we didn't know it?",
        "Angela: Oh my god. [All look at camera horrified]",

        "Angela: There was much more secret filming than I expected. [laughs] But I am fine with it, I mean it. I am.",
        "Oscar: Are you kidding me? It's like half the show is secret footage.",

        "Oscar: I'm sorry sweetie. This whole thing is just freaking me out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Oscar: I have been very honest with you guys. In a way that could seriously impact the political career of a very good friend of mine. You're not going to use any of that, are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: People, relax! We are killing it online. Have you guys checked the comments? SmokeThatSkinwagon says: \"You guys are killing it!\" I mean, we're internet sensations guys!",
        "Angela: I think we need to figure out what's going on. I might just take a little walk.",
        "Stanley: Yes, a little walk sounds like a good idea. [groups moves to warehouse and you can hear Erin whispering something]",
        "Oscar: Ok everyone, turn off your mikes.",
        "Angela: We need to know more. Did their shots have sound? What exactly did they get on tape?",
        "Erin: I sneezed into my hands without using Purell and then dipped into the candy jar. Did they film that?",
        "Nellie: My first week here I sneezed directly into the candy jar because I thought I'd get more [Angela and Oscar make disgusted faces] I thought I'd get more screen time than anyone.",
        "Pete: Ok, Pam. Why don't you visit your buddy, the crew guy that got fired? Find out what they got.",

        "Clark: Oh, the secondary shaft. Eeeh, oooga! [laughs]",
        "Salesmen: The lift capacity's up at two thousand pounds. That's a lot of beets.",
        "Mr. Ruger: Let's talk terms. If you agree to a forty sixty split on this tractor, I'll store it in one of my barns.",
        "Dwight: Mr. Ruger, are you trying to take advantage of me because I'm interested in your daughter? Fifty fifty split or no deal.",
        "Mr. Ruger: Esther, get in the truck.",
        "Dwight: Ok ok ok, wait! You win. [shakes hands]",
        "Salesman: Let's get the paperwork started.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ruger Sister 2: We should buy an auger together.",
        "Clark: Oh, yeah. Yeah.",
        "Ruger Sister 1: You would be a great one to buy an auger with.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stanley: [on phone] Hello, honey? I just spoke to the TV repair man, he says we need to keep our TVs turned off for a couple of months. Something about the wiring.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: Oh! Seven new comments. \"The guy at 0:19 is hawt!\" [typing] \"Hi Bongripper, it's me, Andy. The guy from 0:19, I'm glad that you enjoyed my work in that promo. I really enjoyed your comment, going to read some more comments now. Have a great day!\"[reading] \"He's not hawt, he's gay.\" [typing] \"Dear JasonJasonJason, it's me, Andy. Nice name. Not! Guess what? I'm not gay! So you are an IDIOT. And I am hawt, according to people on this site who have a brain. Never comment on this page ever again.\" [reading] \"He is hawt!\" See, thank you, that's more like it. \"He is butt.\" God dammit! I'm about to lose my FREAKING MIND! Screw you TexasPoonTappa! Uh!",

        "Dwight: What? Don't you cap that pen. Do not cap that pen! Do not! Ugh! You capped it. Wow. You are serious. Ok, you've got two minutes and then the cap comes off.",
        "Clark: Dude, we're being conned.",
        "Dwight: Go on.",
        "Clark: These chicks are way too hot to be into us. Esther's just pretending to like you so that you'll buy her daddy a new tractor.",
        "Dwight: No.",
        "Clark: Yes. Her sister's trying to seduce me into buying an auger with her.",
        "Dwight: What? Has the warranty expired on the auger you have now?",
        "Clark: I don't even know what an auger is!",
        "Dwight: No woman would ever want a man who doesn't know what an auger is.",
        "Mr. Ruger: Hey, you ready to sign?",

        "Brian: Pretty much everything.",
        "Pam: Well yeah, but what if we turned our mike packs?",
