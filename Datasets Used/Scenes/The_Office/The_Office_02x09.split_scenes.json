Pretend you're not here.",
        "Jim: Are we in danger?",
        "Michael: There's no time to think about if this is real. Just, shh, everybody. [knock at the front door]",

        "Michael: The IT tech guy and me did not get off to a great start.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Yeah, I tried to install it myself, but, uh, you guys have these things so password-protected...",
        "Sadiq (IT guy): That just means you have to enter your password.",
        "Michael: Oh...",
        "Sadiq (IT guy): What's your password, Michael?",
        "Michael: Oh, umm... [looks at Post-It on computer]",

        "Michael: I can't tell you.",
        "Dwight: You have to tell me.",
        "Michael: I don't have to tell you anything.",
        "Dwight: Look, Michael, I know you don't want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, God forbid, then I would need to know in order to take over.",
        "Michael: Dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, ok? I'm in the best shape of my life. Look at this. [flexes his arms] Brrr! That's strong!",
        "Dwight: Yeah, but that doesn't matter, you could get a brain aneurysm-",

        "Dwight: Or get hit by a car-",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: There are certain things a boss does not share with his employees. His salary, that would depress them. His bed, it--- And I am not going to tell them that I'll be reading their e-mails.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: So how do you search?",
        "Sadiq (IT guy): By keyword phrase.",
        "Michael: Try \"profits\". No! Try \"Michael Scott\". \"Michael\" \"boss\" and \"funny\". [Sadiq (IT guy) types; result pops up] Oh my God, wow! [chuckles] E-mail from Stanley. Stanley, Terribly nice guy. [reads e-mail] \"Sorry I didn't write back sooner; I can't go to the game tonight because my boss Michael is an ass and making me stay late.\" Well, Stanley's an ass.

        "Michael: Oh, what? No. That defeats the whole purpose.",
        "Dwight: So it's true? You have access to our e-mails?",
        "Michael: You know what the problem is?",
        "Stanley: I think I do.",
        "Michael: The problem is that when people hear the term \"big brother\", they immediately think it's scary or bad, but I don't. I think, wow, I love my big brother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: I gotta erase a lotta stuff. A lot of stuff.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: It's like squishing a spider under a book. It's gonna be really gross but I have to look and make sure that it's really dead. Sooo... [to camera guys] If you guys see anything... ?",

        "Dwight: Nice.",
        "Pam: One is tall and brunette, and the other one is short, and blonde, and perky, and kinda judgmental. Who do you think he should choose?",
        "Dwight: Does he have access to their medical records?",
        "Pam: Ummmm...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: I think one of the greatest things about modern America is the computerization of medical records. As a volunteer sheriff, I can look up anyone's psychiatric records or surgical histories. Yeast infections. There are a huge number of yeast infections in this county. Probably because we are down river from that old bread factory.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Meredith has an E-vite from Jim. Barbeque at Jim's tonight. Tonight? Wonder where my e-vitation is. Click on guest list. Angela, Stanley, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Kevin, Creed. Must be... .[scrolls down list] No.",

        "Angela: Hmm... [Pam reaches towards vending machine] Excuse me.",
        "Pam: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: There's always a distance between a boss and the employees. It is just nature's rule. It's intimidation mostly, it's the awareness that they are not me. I do think that I am very approachable, as one of the guys. But maybe I need to be even approachabler.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: That's pretty young.",
        "Pam: Yeah.",
        "Kevin: [to Michael] Are you gonna eat with us?",

        "Jim: Uh hum.",
        "Michael: Hot, tasty. Reminds me of college. Lived on this stuff. Brain food. Mmmm... You know what I really, really miss about college? The parties. Everybody'd go. The athletes, the, the nerds, professors.",

        "Michael: Yeah! They were the most fun. We always invited them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: It's true. I'm having a party. I've got three cases of imported beer, a karaoke machine, and I didn't invite Michael. So three ingredients for a great party. And it's nothing personal, I just think that if he were there, people wouldn't be able to relax, and you know, have fun, and my roommate wants to meet everybody. Because I'm pretty sure he thinks that I'm making Dwight up. [sighs] He is very real.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: [to cameraman] What? [looks at Dwight eating a Baby Ruth] Ohhhh... Yes! Thank you!",

        "Jim: Oh, uh, no. Could-",
        "Dwight: I was wondering-",
        "Jim: Could, keep that down.",
        "Dwight: Why?",
        "Jim: Because not everybody knows about the party.",
        "Dwight: Like who? Who doesn't know?",
        "Jim: Umm, Michael.",
        "Dwight: Why just Michael?",
        "Jim: Because it's a surprise.",
        "Dwight: Is it?",

        "Pam: Really? That's great.",
        "Jim: I know.",
        "Pam: Maybe we can get him to hide and wait somewhere.",
        "Jim: [laughs] Oh man. Oh, you know what, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on, you know, numbers for food and stuff. So do you think that Roy's gonna come, or...",
        "Pam: Oh, no, he can't make it.",
