        "[Pam is on phone and clicking her mouse rhythmically, Jim is clicking his pen equally as much, and Dwight notices]",
        "Dwight: Stop it!",
        "Jim: Stop what?",
        "Dwight: You're talking about me in Morse Code. Well, you know what? Joke's on you 'cause I know Morse Code. Ha!",
        "Jim: [chuckles] Yeah. That's what we're doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: Yup. That's exactly what we did.",
        "Pam: It all started when Dwight was tapping his foot against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop, he said, \"I will when you lose the baby weight.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: Very well. I must have imagined it. I apologize. [Pam clacking her stapler and Jim responding with tapping his keyboard rhythmically] Detonator. Detonator where? Michael!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Jim. Are you clicking a detonator?",
        "Jim: It's a pen.",
        "Dwight: Michael, come on.",
        "Michael: Get back to work, Dwight. Please.",
        "Dwight: Fine. [clears throat] Hey. Tap away. [Dwight puts noise-cancelling headphones on and Pam and Jim begin to blink rhythmically]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Ooh! Things with Donna are so... oh-ho-ho! They're going great. I, uh... we're just clicking on every level. Emotionally and sexually and... orally and I am not used to relationships going this well. I'm actually having trouble focusing on my job. And I like it!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Who enjoys the weekends? [all raise hands] Of course. Now the weekend is always great if you have someone, which I do. I have Donna. She is hot. She has a Pilates butt. But we need to find something to do this weekend beside have s*x. Did I say that? Yes, I did. [all nod] And the reason you are here is that I need ideas for things that Donna and I could do on the weekend. So just shout it out.",
        "Stanley: I have an idea for your weekend.",
        "Michael: Okay.",
        "Stanley: Let me get back to my desk right now.",
        "Michael: Okay, you get out of here, big dog. [high-fives Stanley] Ah, no, no, no, no. You guys sit down. I need ideas.",
        "Pam: Stanley got to go.",
        "Michael: Yeah, well, Stanley doesn't help with anything. Come on. Shout 'em out, shout 'em out.",
        "Andy: Walk around apple orchards.",
        "Michael: Oh!",
        "Andy: Super romantic.",
        "Michael: That's fun.",
        "Dwight: Eel fishing.",
        "Michael: All right.",
        "Darryl: Curl up with your favorite DVD.",
        "Meredith: You and Donna should hit the Poconos. They have heart-shaped Jacuzzis. Room enough for three.",
        "Michael: We actually went to the Poconos last Tuesday. We headed up there, we went to a little Chinese bistro, um, P.F. Chang's.",
        "Kelly: Wait, why would you go all the way to the Poconos to P.F. Chang's when we have the Great Wall in Scranton.",
        "Michael: Because when your super-hot girlfriend says, \"I wanna go to Mount Pocono,\" you go to Mount Pocono and you do her. And we screwed. Whoops. TMI.",
        "Kelly: Wait, that's crazy far. Are you sure she's not cheating?",
        "Michael: You know what, Kelly? This is the real world. Not The Real World[/b]: Scranton. Oh my God, this is super weird. When Ryan had two girlfriends, he used to take me to some diner in Hazelton just so the other girl wouldn't see.",
        "Ryan: Some diner?! It was the Starlight Diner! It's in a LIFE magazine spread about Americana.",
        "Michael: You guys think Donna's cheating on me?",
        "Pam: No, Michael, no.",
        "Dwight: Are you nuts?",
        "Pam: You had a nice meal with your girlfriend in a lovely place...",
        "Michael: ... and... we had s*x, too.",
        "Pam: That is right. Don't make any more of it.",
        "Michael: How?",
        "Pam: How what?",
        "Michael: How do I not make any more of it?",
        "Pam: You could start by concluding this meeting.",
        "Michael: All right. [all stand up to leave] And she won't say, \"I love you.\"",
        "Dwight: Oh, no.",
        "Andy: How many dates have you been on?",
        "Michael: Nine dates. I said it on the second date.",
        "Andy: Mm.",
        "Oscar: That seems... quick. Even for lesbians.",
        "Ryan: Does she keep her phone locked around you, Michael? Does she watch how much she drinks around you, Michael?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ryan: Does she leave the room when she takes phone calls? Does she keep perfume in her purse? Does she shower before s*x? Does she shower after s*x? Does she...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Yeah, she does all that.",
        "Ryan: Sorry, dude.",
        "Michael: No, no...",
        "Pam: Michael, do not let your imagination run amok.",
        "Michael: Run what?",
        "Pam: Amok. It means, don't let your imagination run out of control.",
        "Michael: Why didn't you just say that, Pam?",
        "Pam: Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control.",
        "Michael: Well, that's easy for you to say. You have a bad imagination. It's stupid. I live in a fantasy world.",
        "Jim: You do?",
        "Michael: Yes, Jim, I do. And I can't stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit.",
        "Jim: But you didn't believe any of this was true five minutes ago.",
        "Michael: That's what makes it so wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Ever since I found out that Donna might be cheating on me, I have not eaten or slept. This not knowing, that's what's killing me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: Oh, God, that tickles. What did...",
        "Michael: [whispers] I want someone to follow Donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator.",
        "Dwight: I think I've got one for you. [hands Michael a business card]",
        "Michael: This is you. How much do you charge?",
        "Dwight: $100 a day, plus expenses.",
        "Michael: I'll give you $50. Money's no object.",
        "Dwight: I'm just gonna warn you... and I say this to all my clients... you might not like what I find.",
        "Michael: Okay.",
        "Dwight: And you might not like how I find it. [slides over table, leaves]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: Of course. Yeah, that's terrible. Okay, let me get back to you. Hey, Stanley. One of my clients just called and said that their Sabre printer started smoking and caught on fire.",
        "Stanley: My doctor told me to cut out hot dogs. We all got problems.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: Hey, Gabe I need to talk to you about something. It's really important.",
        "Gabe: There's no way that you guys have any almond butter, right?",
        "Andy: Yeah, I don't know. Look, one of my clients called. He was in the middle of a big printing job and the back of the printer started smoking and then the paper tray caught on fire.",
        "Gabe: That's weird. I haven't heard of that happening. I would even settle for apricot preserves.",
        "Andy: What are we gonna do about this?",
        "Gabe: I don't know. Call HQ, see if they know anything. Yeah. That's what I'll do today. All right. Yeah.",
        "Andy: Let me know what they say.",
        "Darryl: [puts newspaper down] Wow. That dude is good.",
        "Andy: What do you mean?",
        "Darryl: You didn't feel like he was hiding something?",
        "Andy: I don't know.",
        "Darryl: Like he was... covering something up? Maybe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Darryl: Two years ago, Andy blamed the warehouse for a late shipment that he forgot to process. We got yelled at pretty bad. Almost lost my job, and I was mad as hell at the time. But I said \"Darryl, just wait. He's a fool. There's gonna be an opportunity. Just be patient.\" [smiles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: [sitting on his Firebird's hood in front of a gym] Hi stranger.",
        "Donna: Oh, hi. You work for Michael.",
        "Dwight: I work with Michael.",
        "Donna: Right.",
        "Dwight: Dwight Schrute. [they shake hands]",
        "Donna: Donna, hi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: All cases are solved with logic. The only logical way to find out if Donna Is a cheater is to seduce her, bring her to orgasm, then call Michael and tell him the sad news.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jim: That's interesting. Wow, it's a little early for ice cream, don't you think?",
        "Michael: It's never too early for ice cream, Jim. But we didn't have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives.",
        "Pam: Oh!...",
        "Jim: Oh, my God",
        "Michael: It's comfort food, all right? [disgustedly] God.",
        "Jim: You know Michael, this whole Donna thing is gonna be okay, you just... stop beating yourself up.",
        "Michael: I know. Well, I hope you're right. We'll see what Dwight says.",
        "Pam: Why do we have to see what Dwight says?",
        "Michael: Because I have him investigating her. I'm waiting for a text update.",
        "Jim: Michael, no...",
        "Pam: No, no, no, no. Undo that. Undo that.",
        "Michael: It's too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok.",
        "Pam: Michael. Okay, I'm... I'm going to talk straight to you because I think you need to hear it. Michael.",
        "Michael: God, this is so disgusting.",
        "Pam: Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you.",
        "Michael: I know.",
        "Pam: And you kind of torpedo every romantic relationship you're in.",
        "Michael: That's not true. [Pam stares him down] You're right, I ruin everything. And I've known some wonderful women. Holly, Carol, Jan.",
        "Pam: Helene.",
        "Michael: Helene?",
        "Pam: My mother.",
        "Michael: Oh.",
        "Pam: My mother, Helene. [Jim shakes his head]",
        "Michael: Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. All of, all of the greatest loves of my life.",
        "Jim: You should stop this, [pulls away mayo and olives bowl] and you should call Dwight right now.",
        "Michael: [sighs] All right. [calls Dwight]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: [at gym, looks ready to work out, checks phone, and tries to grab Donna's attention] Oh, gosh, we were both going for the same weight at the same time; you go ahead.",
        "Donna: Thank you.",
        "Dwight: It's all yours. [strains loudly to lift two dumbbells and a free weight chained to strap around his head] Ah! [after first rep, Dwight is injured]",
        "Donna: You okay?",
        "Dwight: Yeah, I'm good. Hey, you know an exercise for two people that uses the whole body?",
        "Donna: [chuckles] Yeah, I think I know what you're talking about.",
        "Dwight: Tractor pulling. Too bad there's not a tractor here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: [moaning loudly on exercise machine while staring at Donna who's next to him] Oh. Oh. Oh. [groans loudly] One thing you need to know about me. I don't quit until something tears or pops. [chuckles] You look like you're getting a good workout. Can I feel your pulse?",
        "Donna: Nope. I'm good, thanks.",
        "Dwight: Really? Hey, um... [Dwight gets up and walks sorely from his \"workout\"]",
        "Old lady: Look, young man, can you wipe down that seat?",
        "Dwight: Get out of my way. Huh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dwight: Tomorrow's fertilizer, am I right?",
        "Donna: I'm out of here.",
        "Dwight: Donna. Donna, wait, please. I'm sorry. Okay? Listen. We both know why I'm here[/b]: to see... you... naked... while... I'm... naked.",
        "Donna: You stay away from me, or I'm calling security.",
        "Dwight: Donna, come... Ah! Grr! Ugh! [Dwight is very sore from his \"workout\" and cannot chase Donna]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: You're back. What happened?",
        "Dwight: Oh, I pulled muscles in both my thighs. Thanks for asking.",
        "Michael: No, what happened with Donna?",
        "Dwight: Yeah, no. She's not cheating. Oh, man! Will you help me work out this knot? Right here. [near his groin]",
        "Michael: Ugh!",
        "Dwight: Put your fingers here.",
        "Michael: No. No! Are you sure?",
        "Dwight: I'm positive. Yeah, oh, and here's your expense receipts right there.",
        "Michael: Who eats eight protein bars?",
        "Dwight: People who don't trust egg whites.",
        "Michael: Okay. Well, I am just glad this is all over.",
        "Dwight: Oh, me too. And by the way, uh, I told her not to, but she's coming over here and she's furious.",
        "Michael: What? No, she didn't say that.",
        "Dwight: You're right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was, [pulls out notebook] \"What is with him? He is crazy. I'm coming over there to talk to him.\" And this was after I have no other recourse but to tell her and gym security that you had me sent there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym. You'll be billed monthly. [lays down gym membership receipt on a chair in Michael's office.",
        "Michael: I am not paying for that membership.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: [sitting on the floor behind Erin's desk, sighs] Ohhh... mmm...",
        "Erin: Maybe you'd be more comfortable in your own office.",
        "Michael: No, I like the attention. Is she here yet?",
        "Erin: Uh, no. [Michael sighs, Donna enters] Wait, yes.",
        "Michael: That's her?",
        "Erin: Yeah.",
        "Michael: Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Right. [Michael pretends to be speaking on the phone as Donna approaches] Okay, I'll talk to you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Donna: How could you think I would cheat on you?",
        "Michael: I didn't. Everybody else here did. Everybody convinced me that something was up. They poisoned my mind.",
        "Donna: That's pathetic.",
        "Michael: Ye... pfff. Well, no. It's a lie. That's not what happened. I just like you. I can't believe I get to be with you. You work at an adult arcade. You could have any man you want.",
        "Donna: When I tell you I like you, you need to trust me, not some freak. [Dwight is gulping some sort of power shake]",
        "Michael: If you wanna dump me, I totally get it.",
        "Donna: I told you I like you.",
        "Michael: Well, you are boner-ific. [Donna laughs]",
        "Donna: Hey, if I said that we should go away for a couple of days, you would...",
        "Michael: ...poop my pants.",
        "Donna: Have you ever been to Vero Beach?",
        "Michael: Oh, my God, Vero Beach. No. Is that on the water?",
        "Donna: We're going.",
        "Michael: We are?",
        "Donna: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: What's up? I got your e-mail.",
        "Darryl: Close the door.",
        "Andy: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Darryl: I don't have a plan exactly. More of a loose structure. Gives me freedom to improvise. It's like jazz. [scatting] Andy don't mess with me. [continues scatting] I'll figure something out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Darryl: Some freaky stuff going on. I was walking behind Gabe and I heard some things.",
        "Andy: Such as?",
        "Darryl: It was kind of mumbled, I don't know, uh, only thing I could make out clearly was \"Andy,\" \"Problem,\" \"Eliminate,\" something. I don't know what it meant.",
        "Andy: What? You don't know what it meant? How about \"Andy is a problem and we must eliminate him?\"",
        "Darryl: Whoa. I hadn't even thought of that.",
        "Andy: [chuckles nervously] Yeah. Hah. Hoo.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelly: Oh, hey, I love your earrings.",
        "Donna: Thank you.",
        "Kelly: Did Michael get them for you?",
        "Donna: No, I bought them myself.",
        "Kelly: Where?",
        "Donna: Steamtown Mall.",
        "Kelly: Claire's? Zales? Ricky's? Earring, Earrings? Fancy Girl? Platinum Cat? Where?",
        "Donna: You know, I actually got them in Philadelphia, in a mall down there.",
        "Kelly: Franklin Mills? King of Prussia? Springfield? Governor's Place?",
        "Donna: Uh, Franklin Mills.",
        "Jim: [to Pam] What?",
        "Pam: Hmm? Oh. It's probably nothing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: Okay, heart-shaped jewelry is not something that a woman buys for herself. A man definitely bought it for her recently, and it wasn't Michael.",
        "Jim: Wait, so are you... you like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right?",
        "Pam: No. Except for the pendant that you bought me. Which I love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Creed: Psst... [Creed walks by Andy and draws his right index finger across his neck, further scaring Andy, Andy looks over at Darryl who is staring him down]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: Creed's head of quality assurance. So he'd definitely be wrapped up in this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Creed: So there I am, minding my own business and Darnell offers me three bucks. All I gotta do is walk by Andy and go like this. [draws finger across neck] Darnell's a chump. I would have done it for anything. I've done a lot more for a lot less.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pam: So it turns out Donna and I have a facebook friend of a friend in common, so I was able to see some of her pictures online. [pulls out picture of Donna embracing a man and smiling] This was taken two weeks ago. And this was taken the same night. [pulls out a picture of Donna kissing the same man] This photo was taken this morning. [shows a baby picture] It's Cece. [laughs] She's never gonna do anything wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Donna: Isn't that something?",
        "Michael: Wow. [Pam knocks on Michaels door and goes in] That's exciting.",
        "Pam: Hey, Michael.",
        "Michael: Hey.",
        "Pam: I'm sorry to interrupt you. Um, I actually have something very important to talk to you about, business related.",
        "Michael: Well it can wait. It can wait.",
        "Pam: I lied it's personal. It's about me and Jim. We're... I just... you're the only person I can talk to.",
        "Michael: Jim is her husband.",
        "Donna: Oh.",
        "Pam: And...",
        "Michael: And they are having problems, so sh...",
        "Pam: No, not... we're not... we're not having problems. But it is personal. And I would love...",
        "Michael: Good in bed.",
        "Pam: Yes. Yes, I desperately want to speak with you about my s*x life with Jim.",
        "Michael: Oh, my God. Look at how cheap street level rooms are. Am I the only person who enjoys people watching?",
        "Pam: [loudly] I need you to sign this! So bad!",
        "Michael: Okay, weirdo.",
        "Pam: I love [leans over Michael's desk to look at his computer screen]... this idea is neat. I've never been. It sounds lovely. [meanwhile Michael looks at the pictures Pam printed out]",
        "Donna: Yeah I think it'll be a nice trip. We're gonna get a lot done.",
        "Pam: [to Michael] You're gonna wanna look at the date on that. Oh, wow. Look at... golfing. [to Donna] Are you a golfer?",
        "Donna: I am, but I, I gave my clubs away. I swear too much. [Pam and Donna both laugh] Hey, you okay? [to Michael, walking away disappointedly]",
        "Michael: Yeah, I just remembered that I have to go to the bathroom. Pam?",
        "Pam: Absolutely. [both leave Michael's office]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Darryl: Look, I'm not down there anymore, so if the guys start making fun of you, you just, you gotta stand up for yourself.",
        "Glen: I know, it's just, I'm scared...",
        "Andy: Your text said 911.",
        "Darryl: Glen, could you excuse us? [Andy slams the door after Glen leaves, panting heavily]",
        "Darryl: It's bad.",
        "Andy: What's bad?",
        "Darryl: It's real bad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Darryl: Still no plan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Andy: Oh, God.",
        "Darryl: It's getting bigger.",
        "Andy: I might have to go public here, but no one's gonna believe me. Uh... I need proof. I need, like, a printer to catch on fire.",
        "Darryl: I can videotape it.",
        "Andy: Yeah.",
        "Darryl: [to camera] There it is.",
        "Andy: There what is?",
        "Darryl: What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Michael: Who the hell is this? Who is this guy?",
        "Pam: I don't know who he is.",
        "Michael: God! Lowest of the low. That guy. Just a notch above Toby. You know what?",
        "Pam: What?",
        "Michael: I'm gonna kill him. No, I'm not. I feel... I... no, I'm not going to kill him.",
        "Pam: You just have to go in there. You have to hear it from her.",
        "Michael: I have to hear it from her.",
        "Pam: You have to settle down first.",
        "Michael: I need to have her tell me herself. Right?",
        "Pam: Okay. Okay. Yes.",
        "Michael: I need to have her say...",
        "Pam: Yeah, but you have to calm...",
        "Michael: I need to say, \"What the hell is that? What the hell is that?\"",
        "Pam: Okay. Look at this, look at this. Baby picture.",
        "Michael: No, God! No, no, oh, my God!",
        "Pam: [in baby voice] Hi, Michael, hi, Michael",
        "Michael: [calms down] Okay. Okay. Okay.",
