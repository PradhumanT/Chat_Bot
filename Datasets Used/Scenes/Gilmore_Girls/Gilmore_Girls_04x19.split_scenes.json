        "OPEN ON SIDEWALK OF STARS HOLLOW",
        "[Lorelai briskly walks down the street as Luke, also walking quickly, joins her.]",
        "LUKE: Hey.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, I left a tip this time. And I didn't put it under the water glass, 'cause I know you hate that, and I made sure it didn't touch the syrup, 'cause that makes it sticky, and I didn't leave the last dollar in pennies just to get rid of them.",
        "LUKE: I know.",
        "LORELAI: So, why are you running down the street yelling at me?",
        "LUKE: I wasn't running. I was walking. I wasn't yelling. I was talking.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, what did you say?",
        "LUKE: \"Hey.\"",
        "LORELAI: Oh, hey.",
        "LUKE: You are a lot of work.",
        "LORELAI: No, you're a lot of work.",
        "LUKE: You heading in there? [He indicates a store entrance.]",
        "LORELAI: Yeah. I need stamps. You heading in there?",
        "LUKE: Yep. I'm getting my divorce. [He reaches for the door.]",
        "LORELAI: What? [She stops in her tracks, shocked.]",
        "LUKE: Yeah. [He returns to stand before her.]",
        "LORELAI: You're g-getting a mail-order divorce?",
        "LUKE: These are the papers we had drawn up before. I just have to sign them.",
        "LORELAI: And you're signing them in there?",
        "LUKE: There's a notary in there.",
        "LORELAI: Luke, that is a Mail Boxes Etc.",
        "LUKE: So?",
        "LORELAI: So, you buy envelopes at a Mail Boxes Etc. You don't get divorced at a Mail Boxes Etc.",
        "LUKE: Why not?",
        "LORELAI: Because, I don't -- it's not dignified.",
        "LUKE: Well, crapping out in a marriage isn't that dignified, either, but I did that.",
        "LORELAI: Luke...",
        "LUKE: Look, I just want to get this over with. It's not a big deal. I just need to sign a piece of paper.",
        "LORELAI: You're ending a marriage.",
        "LUKE: I'm signing a paper --",
        "LORELAI: -- that says you're ending a marriage.",
        "LUKE: Please let me do this.",
        "LORELAI: Why don't you go to a lawyer's office?",
        "LUKE: I hate lawyers.",
        "LORELAI: How about a friend's house?",
        "LUKE: Dougie and Scooter are off at camp.",
        "LORELAI: This is wrong.",
        "LUKE: This is fine. This is practical.",
        "LORELAI: Getting a divorce should not be practical.",
        "LUKE: I only have 20 minutes until I have to be back at work.",
        "LORELAI: A divorce should not be rushed.",
        "LUKE: For someone who's never actually been through a divorce, you sure know a lot about it.",
        "LORELAI: You should take a few minutes to think.",
        "LUKE: I have thought. It's over. I know it's over. And all I have to do is go in there and sign this paper in front of a notary, and then it's officially over. I'm fine. Please, I'm begging you -- let me get divorced.",
        "LORELAI: All right, then. Go ahead. [She solemnly looks down at the sidewalk.]",
        "LUKE: Thank you. [He starts to move to the door then pauses, again returning to Lorelai who isn't following.] I thought you needed stamps.",
        "LORELAI: I can get them later.",
        "LUKE: What are you doing?",
        "LORELAI: I just thought I'd give you some privacy.",
        "LUKE: I'm not taking a shower -- I'm signing a paper.",
        "LORELAI: I can come back later.",
        "LUKE: Will you please get in there and buy your stamps?",
        "LORELAI: Okay, fine.",
        "LUKE: [He follows her inside.] Lots and lots of work...",
        "CUT TO INSIDE MAIL BOXES ETC STORE",
        "KIRK: [He pops up from behind the counter.] Welcome to Mail Boxes Etc. How may I help you?",
        "LORELAI: You go ahead.",
        "LUKE: I need to get something notarized.",
        "KIRK: Terrific. We are happy to help you with all of your mailing and notarizing needs. I will need you to fill out your name and address, and then I will need a thumbprint.",
        "LUKE: I know how it works, Kirk.",
        "KIRK: You have a pen?",
        "LUKE: I have a pen.",
        "KIRK: [to Lorelai] What can I do for you today?",
        "LORELAI: [gently] I can wait till he's done.",
        "LUKE: She needs stamps.",
        "LORELAI: I can wait till he's -",
        "LUKE: Just get your stamps. [Lorelai tries to object.] Just get your stamps.",
        "LORELAI: But - but, I -",
        "LUKE: Oh, my God, the work. [He shakes his head and continues to fill out the form.]",
        "LORELAI: I need stamps.",
        "KIRK: Well, your timing is perfect. The breakfast-food series just came out last week. [shows sheet to Lorelai]",
        "LORELAI: [She gasps with delight.] Look at the dancing toast.",
        "KIRK: Aren't they a kick? And here is our cartoon series.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, do you have any Lucille Balls left?",
        "KIRK: Yes, I have some Balls. [Luke looks up and reacts unnoticed.] I'm sorry. Are you a fan of the '50s-slash-mid-'60s sitcom heroines?",
        "LORELAI: I don't know. [eager anticipation] Am I?",
        "KIRK: I think you are.",
        "LORELAI: [gasps] \"Bewitched?\" I love \"Bewitched.\"",
        "KIRK: Me too. Dr. Bombay was a big influence on me.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, my God -- Serena? I wanted to be Serena. With that hair...",
        "KIRK: And the miniskirts...",
        "LORELAI: And the groovy, psychedelic music...",
        "KIRK: Did you practice the twitch?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, who didn't practice the twitch? [giggles]",
        "[Luke tries to concentrate and begins to look impatient]",
        "KIRK: Tabitha was so lucky. And hey, what ever happened to her little brother Adam? I mean, they determined in episode 242 that he was a warlock, and then...",
        "LUKE: I'm trying to get divorced here!",
        "KIRK: Sorry.",
        "LORELAI: [gently] I'm sorry.",
        "[There's a long pause while Luke sighs and continues with the form.]",
        "KIRK: [speaking quietly] Remember when Endora called him \"Derwood?\"",
        "LORELAI: Shh. [She gestures to Luke, who is shifting impatiently.]",
        "KIRK: Sorry.",
        "CUT TO LUKE'S DINER",
        "[Lorelai enters, approaches and sits at the counter where Luke is prying at a toaster.]",
        "LORELAI: Oh man. Beat up the toaster again?",
        "LUKE: This damn thing stopped working.",
        "LORELAI: Could get another one.",
        "LUKE: This one will be fine.",
        "LORELAI: Sure -- as soon as it learns its place. You gonna go ten rounds with the coffee maker, or - [Luke is already pouring her a cup of coffee.] Ooh, thank you. What happened to your thumb?",
        "LUKE: It's from the thumbprint yesterday.",
        "LORELAI: I thought they had inkless pads now.",
        "LUKE: They do, Kirk doesn't.",
        "LORELAI: Right.",
        "LUKE: [He resumes working on the toaster.] He hasn't even heard of them. He just uses the stuff that came in the notary kit he sent away for. I've been scrubbing my thumb for two days. I've tried soap, I've tried cleaning fluid -",
        "LORELAI: Have you tried fire?",
        "LUKE: Now not only am I divorced, every time I look at my black thumb, I'm reminded that I'm divorced.",
        "LORELAI: Sorry about your thumb.",
        "LUKE: It's okay. I have another one.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, you know what might make you feel better?",
        "LUKE: What?",
        "LORELAI: Handing me a cherry Danish.",
        "LUKE: Well, it's certainly worth a try. [A cell phone in Lorelai's purse rings.] Out.",
        "LORELAI: But I just got my coffee.",
        "LUKE: Follow the thumb.",
        "CUT TO OUTSIDE LUKE'S DINER ENTRANCE",
        "LORELAI: Hello?",
        "RORY'S VOICE: Who is this?",
        "LORELAI: This is Lorelai Gilmore.",
        "[Cut between Rory's dorm room and Stars Hollow outside.]",
        "RORY: No, this is Lorelai Gilmore.",
        "LORELAI: Ooh, \"Gaslight.\"",
        "RORY: So, you have my phone.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, you left it in the kitchen. You know what that means, don't you? You miss Mommy.",
        "RORY: Yes, or that the refrigerator was empty, and I ordered food.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, that makes much more sense.",
        "RORY: Just hold onto it for me? I'll get it from you next time I see you.",
        "LORELAI: Okay -- ooh, hold on, hon. [A second cell phone rings and now she has a cell phone held to each ear.] Hello?",
        "JASON: So, I'm officially taking the one hour I have off to go to the driving range to hit golf balls to try to improve my sucky game, thereby redeeming myself in your father's eyes.",
        "LORELAI: I like the use of \"sucky\" and \"thereby\" in the same sentence.",
        "RORY: Hey, who's that?",
        "LORELAI: It's Jason.",
        "RORY: Tell him hi.",
        "[Luke exits the diner and approaches holding Lorelai's Danish.]",
        "LORELAI: Hey, Rory says hi.",
        "JASON: Tell her hi back.",
        "LORELAI: He says hi back. [to Luke] Hi.",
        "LUKE: This is a sickness.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I'll be in in a minute.",
        "LUKE: Who are you talking to?",
        "LORELAI: My other two personalities.",
        "LUKE: I'll bring this back inside. [He starts to leave.]",
        "LORELAI: Wait, wait -- bite. [Luke holds the Danish out and she carefully takes a bite.]",
        "LUKE: A frightening picture of things to come. [He goes back inside the diner.]",
        "LORELAI: Did you talk to anyone yet?",
        "JASON: I left a message for Dad. I talked to Mom, but she just had her morning Mr. Happy pill, so of course she was having a happy morning and was absolutely no help. But I'm on it.",
        "LORELAI'S VOICE: A man on a mission.",
        "JASON: That's me.",
        "RORY: Fire!",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "RORY: Nothing. I was just feeling left out.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, sorry.",
        "JASON: I figure, if he doesn't call me back by 4:00, I'll just go over there. Okay, I'm at the club. I'm gonna hang up now.",
        "LORELAI: Call me later.",
        "RORY: Me?",
        "LORELAI: No.",
        "JASON: No?",
        "LORELAI: Not you.",
        "RORY: Not me?",
        "LORELAI: Uh, I'm confused. [She has both phones to her ears.] Who's hanging up now?",
        "JASON: Uh, that would be me.",
        "LORELAI: Good. Okay. I'll talk to you later. [to Rory] Jason's gone.",
        "RORY: Finally had enough of you.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, yeah. It took three hours of my hula-dancing, Small World doll impressions, but I broke him.",
        "RORY: So, how's World War III going?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, you know, the first boys off the boat were mowed down, but the next platoon is moving in.",
        "RORY: Which means?",
        "LORELAI: Jason's making the lawsuit go away.",
        "RORY: Have you talked to Grandma or Grandpa yet?",
        "LORELAI: No.",
        "RORY: Have you tried to talk to Grandma or Grandpa yet?",
        "LORELAI: No.",
        "RORY: That's my little Kofi Annan.",
        "LORELAI: Jason will fix it.",
        "RORY: Jason's not their daughter.",
        "LORELAI: Then he might have better luck.",
        "RORY: Why didn't you just tell them that you guys were dating?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, come on. You know why. We were going to tell them when the time was right. Of course, I had no idea we were dealing with the Carringtons. All we needed was a swimming pool and some ball gowns to really end the evening right.",
        "RORY: This is unbelievable. I leave you people alone for one hour and all hell breaks loose.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, let's talk about something happy. How did your paper turn out?",
        "RORY: It sucked.",
        "LORELAI: Why did it suck?",
        "RORY: I just couldn't find the right hook. It didn't feel focused enough. I don't know. Professor Fleming's class is so hard.",
        "LORELAI: Hon, I bet it was great.",
        "RORY: You have to say that 'cause you're my mother.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, no. I'm not. I've been looking for the right time to tell you.",
        "RORY: Okay, I have to go now.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, me too. Danish calls.",
        "RORY: Talk to parents.",
        "LORELAI: I'm going to take advice from you after that paper you turned in?",
        "RORY: Goodbye.",
        "LORELAI: Goodbye.",
        "CUT TO LANE'S APARTMENT",
        "[Zach and Brian are playing a video game while Gil sits patiently tuning his guitar.]",
        "ZACH: Dude, come on... I want to do a heavenly prayer.",
        "BRIAN: Hold on, I'm trying to do a Vulcan sting, and I just let you do a half-moon death combo.",
        "ZACH: You didn't let me -- I used my soul charge.",
        "[Lane, holding a notebook, enters and sits.]",
        "LANE: Guys, the band meeting started ten minutes ago.",
        "ZACH: We can hear and play at the same time, Lane.",
        "BRIAN: What?",
        "ZACH: What?",
        "LANE: Okay, fine. I'm going to decide the set list without you. Hey, Gil, I think now would be a great time to add a little Matchbox Twenty to our sound, don't you?",
        "[Zach turns to stare at Lane - giving Brian the advantage of beating Zach at the video game.]",
        "TV: Necrid wins! [Zach stares at the TV in shock.]",
        "ZACH: [with sarcasm] Thank you, Lane.",
        "LANE: You're welcome, Zach. Okay, let's do this. The gig is Friday night.",
        "GIL: Oh, hey, Lane. Who's taking care of the guest list? I need to put my wife down. We got a sitter that night, so we are free to party.",
        "BRIAN: How many people are we allowed to invite? 'Cause my aunt Susan left my uncle Sid, and she's staying with my parents, and that means she's going to bring my cousin, Turner.",
        "LANE: I'm sure that's fine.",
        "BRIAN: He goes everywhere dressed like Zorro.",
        "LANE: That still seems fine.",
        "BRIAN: And he's 16.",
        "ZACH: One less wedding you're gonna have to go to, my friend.",
        "BRIAN: You don't know that.",
        "ZACH: Here. [He hands Lane a folded paper napkin.]",
        "LANE: What's this?",
        "ZACH: It's the names of a couple chicks I met last night. Put them on the list.",
        "LANE: I'm sorry -- why am I suddenly in charge of the guest list?",
        "BRIAN: 'Cause you're the most reliable.",
        "LANE: How very rock 'n' roll.",
        "ZACH: Hey, wait. [He looks at another napkin from his pocket.] Is one of those names Dixie?",
        "LANE: Yes.",
        "ZACH: Wrong night. [He swaps napkins with Lane.]",
        "GIL: I want you guys to see something. I've been working on the flier for the gig. [They gather around Gil.]",
        "ZACH: Why is there a sandwich on it?",
        "GIL: I used a flier from the sandwich shop to get the dimensions right. It's just a prototype. The real one won't have the sandwich on it.",
        "LANE: So, would there be a picture of us where the sandwich is?",
        "ZACH: Or we could put the band name where the sandwich is.",
        "GIL: Just the name, I think. Diagonal. Across where the sandwich is.",
        "BRIAN: Everyone needs to stop saying \"sandwich.\" I'm getting hungry.",
        "ZACH: Me too. Do we have anything to eat?",
        "LANE: It was your turn to shop.",
        "ZACH: Then no.",
        "LANE: Great.",
        "BRIAN: What kind of sandwich is that?",
        "GIL: That's the meatball explosion.",
        "BRIAN: That sounds fantastic.",
        "ZACH: I would dress up like Zorro for a meatball explosion.",
        "BRIAN: Why would those be connected?",
        "ZACH: It would be like a dare.",
        "BRIAN: I once ate cheesecake off the floor on a dare.",
        "ZACH: Cheesecake...",
        "GIL: Cheesecake would be good with the meatball explosion.",
        "LANE: Okay, fine. [She puts down the notebook and tugs on her jacket.]",
        "BRIAN: Where you going?",
        "LANE: I'm going to go to the store, and I'm going to get us some food so maybe we can get back to work. Okay?",
        "ZACH: Thanks, Mom.",
        "[Lane crosses the street and notices a young Korean girl exiting her mother's house in the distance. From behind a tall shrub, Lane watches Mrs. Kim follow the young girl, slip a scarf around her neck and hand her an apple. Lane also notices the young girl is wearing her old sweater. Lane looks shocked then sad.]",

        "[Jason is not doing well.]",
        "JASON: [muttering to himself] Yeah, sure, that's exactly what I meant to do. [He sees a familiar face walking by.] Hey, Owen, good to see you. [They shake hands.]",
        "OWEN: Ah, yes. Good to see you too, Jason. [He quickly turns to leave.]",
        "JASON: You know, I was gonna call you about the changes in those contracts I sent over.",
        "OWEN: I'll call Richard about them tomorrow.",
        "JASON: Okay, or -",
        "OWEN: Goodbye, Jason.",

        "CUT TO DRAGONFLY IN LOBBY",
        "[Michel leads a tour group around while talking about the inn.]",
        "MICHEL: All of the woodwork was hand-carved by a union soldier that the owner, Mrs. Tinley, took pity on and nursed back to health. He got better, went off, slaughtered a few dozen Confederate soldiers, came back, and made the stairs. Nice story, yes? [The tour group follows Michel to the front lobby.] Yes, your American history is all over this inn. [He points through a window.] Oh, look, a deer. I think I know that little guy -- he was here for breakfast this morning. Creep up quietly. Take a better look. [He sighs as the group \"oohs\" and \"ahhs\" around the window. Michel turns to Lorelai, who stands behind the front desk.] I have these people in the palm of my hand. Travel agents are so easy. Are the horses washed?",
        "LORELAI: They're washed.",
        "MICHEL: Because I'm not bringing them out there to be disgusted by smelly horses.",
        "LORELAI: Trust me. They've been hosed down with new-car scent. They're great.",
        "MICHEL Okay, let's see -- they saw the deer, we released the doves, I've got the Stevens boy whitewashing the fence in short pants and a straw hat.",
        "LORELAI: No one can manufacture a quaint, small-town moment like you, Michel.",
        "MICHEL: [grins] Awww...",
        "LORELAI: Ooh, travel agents coming back.",
        "MICHEL: [His grin evaporates.] Ugh... [His smile reappears as he turns to the group.] Adorable, yes? Okay, let me show you the upstairs, the bedrooms -- [sniffs the air] Oh, what is that delicious scent? Why, I bet our amazing chef, Sookie St. James, is experimenting with her cookie recipe again. Why don't we sneak into the kitchen and see if we can convince her to give us a taste? Okay? Follow me.",
        "MAN: Coming through! [Two men pass Michel carrying Sookie between them.]",
        "SOOKIE: Coming through!",
        "LORELAI: [gasps] Sookie!",
        "SOOKIE: I'm okay.",
        "LORELAI: What happened?",
        "MICHEL: Did you make the cookies?",
        "LORELAI: Is it your foot?",
        "SOOKIE: I don't think I broke it. [She is grinning.] I didn't even hear a snap this time.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, Sookie...",
        "MICHEL: What about the cookies?",
        "SOOKIE: Ooh, the cookies are on the counter. Caramel-marshmallow-chocolate-chunk.",
        "LORELAI: Where are you taking her?",
        "MAN: Dr. Su.",

        "LORELAI: Call me the minute you get there.",
        "SOOKIE: Okay. God, I love having a kitchen again.",
        "LORELAI: You put the doctor on so I can talk to him?",
        "SOOKIE: I will. Hey.",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "SOOKIE: I'm back. [laughing]",
        "[As the Inn's van pulls away, Lorelai sees Jason exiting his car and approaching.]",
        "LORELAI: Well, this is a nice surprise.",
        "JASON: Well, apparently this is a day for surprises.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, what's the matter?",
        "JASON: I spent the entire day trying to track down your father.",
        "LORELAI: Do you want to sit or plant or...",
        "JASON: I left messages at his house, on his cell phone...finally, I went to the office, and he wasn't there.",

Be prepared to discuss Kafka's \"The Trial.\" Yes, if, uh, if all goes well, it'll get very ugly. Thank you, everyone. [The class chuckles as they all rise to leave. Rory walks past Asher's desk on her way out.] Oh, very nice job on your paper, Miss Gilmore.",
        "RORY: Oh, thank you. [She pauses.] You know, Professor Fleming, I was actually a little surprised by my grade.",
        "ASHER: Were you? Well, you deserved it. You did good work.",

        "ASHER: Ah, a perfectionist.",
        "RORY: No, I'm not a perfectionist. I just know when I do well and when I don't.",

        "ASHER: Oh, how very noble of you.",
        "RORY: I intend to earn all of my grades. I don't want any favors.",

        "RORY: I suppose I am. [She turns to leave.]",
        "ASHER: Oh, before you go any further, Miss Gilmore, let me assure you that I do not give grades that are not earned. I gave you an \"A\" because your argument was well-structured, your writing was clear and concise, and you drew a connection from Marsilius of Padua to Machiavelli to the modern age of media that PhD candidates would envy. In fact, no one else's paper was that thoroughly researched. Except for the other person who also got an \"A.\" You did what was demanded, and you did it well. And I would seriously caution you not to question my grading tactics again.",

        "LORELAI You gonna let go of that purse, Mom?",
        "EMILY: What?",

        "RORY: She was in a hurry?",
        "LORELAI: My mother never parks her car in the driveway, because the car might drip oil and make a spot on the concrete, and then life as we know it would end. [She approaches the car and looks in the windows.]",

Of course, my scenario also involved my mother finding her inner Timothy Leary and moving us all out to a commune in Berkeley, but still... I was convinced that these people should not be together, but you know what? I was wrong. Richard and Emily Gilmore were made for each other. God, this is so...freaky. And I'm not supposed to know, and of course we won't talk about it, because we don't do that in our family. We repress everything, and we refuse to go to therapy, because why tell a stranger your problems, when you can use them to punish those around you? So, what now? Every Friday I'm supposed to pretend that they still live together, and then after we leave, my mother will get in her car and drive back to the hotel? The hotel. My mother's living in a hotel.
