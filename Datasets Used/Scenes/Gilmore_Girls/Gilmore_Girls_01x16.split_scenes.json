    "Recap": [
        "Luke's ex-girlfriend Rachel arrives in Stars Hollow unexpectedly, and immediately picks up on the attraction between Luke and Lorelai, which they deny. Rachel decides to stay for awhile, which leaves Luke and Lorelai with mixed feelings. Lorelai and Rory are amazed when Emily agrees to excuse Rory from Friday night dinner so that Rory and Dean can celebrate their three month anniversary. When Lorelai arrives for dinner, she discovers the source of Emily's largesse -- her mother has invited another guest -- a man with whom she secretly hopes to fix Lorelai up. After a painful dinner with one of the world's most boring men, Lorelai attempts to escape through the window of her old bedroom, but is caught in the act by Richard. When he is forced to admit that even he is bored by the man, he uncharacteristically covers for her and lets her make her getaway. Back in Stars Hollow, Dean treats Rory to a wonderfully romantic dinner, and then gives her a present: a car that he's restoring for her. As they sit in the car, Dean professes his love, but Rory is unsure how to respond."

        "OPEN IN STARS HOLLOW",
        "(Miss Patty narrates a story in the background as the camera pans around town as locals prepare for a festival.)",
        "MISS PATTY: This, boys and girls, is the story of true love. A beautiful girl from one county; a handsome boy from another. They meet and they fall in love. Separated by distance and by parents who did not approve of the union, the young couple dreamed of a day that they could be together. They wrote each other beautiful letters. Letters of longing and passion. Letters full of promises and plans for the future. Soon the separation proved too much for either one of them to bear. So, one night, cold and black with no light to guide them, they both snuck out of their homes and ran away as fast as they could. It was so dark out that they were both soon lost and it seemed as if they would never find each other. Finally, the girl dropped to her knees, tears streaming down her lovely face. 'Oh, my love. Where are you? How will I find you?' Suddenly, a band of stars appeared in the sky. These stars shone so brightly they lit up the entire countryside. The girl jumped to her feet and followed the path of the stars until finally she found herself standing right where the town gazebo is today. And there waiting for her was her one true love, who had also been led here by the blanket of friendly stars. [Camera stops on Miss Patty's dance studio, where she is telling the story to a group of children.] And that, my friends, is the story of how Stars Hollow came to be, and why we celebrate that fateful night every year at about this time. Now, we still have a little time left in our story hour. Who wants to hear about the time I danced in a cage for Tito Puente?",
        "KIDS: [raising hands] Me!",
        "MISS PATTY: It was the summer of 66 ..",

        "CUT TO BUS STOP",
        "(Dean is waiting on the bench as Rory steps off the bus.)",
        "RORY: So?",
        "DEAN: It's depressing.",
        "RORY: It's beautiful.",
        "DEAN: She throws herself under a train.",
        "RORY: But I bet she looked great doing it.",
        "DEAN: I don't know. I think maybe Tolstoy's just a little over my head.",
        "RORY: No, that's not true. Tolstoy wrote for the masses, the common man. It's completely untrue that you have to be some kind of genius to read his stuff.",
        "DEAN: Yeah but",
        "RORY: Now I know it's big. . .",
        "DEAN: Very big.",
        "RORY: And long. . .",
        "DEAN: Very, very long",
        "RORY: And many of the Russian names tend be spelled very similar, making it confusing",
        "DEAN: Every single person's name ends with 'ski'. Now how is that possible?",
        "RORY: But it's one of my favorite books. And I know that if you just give it a try you...",
        "DEAN: All right. I'll try again.",
        "RORY: Really?",
        "DEAN: Yeah.",
        "RORY: You won't be sorry.",
        "DEAN: Coffee?",
        "RORY: Please.",
        "DEAN: Man, I thought Christmas was a big deal around here.",
        "RORY: Well, this is a town that likes the celebrating. Last year we had a month long carnival when we finally got off the septic tank system.",
        "DEAN: A month long? You're kidding.",
        "RORY: No. There were rides and a petting zoo and balloon animals and a freak show.",
        "DEAN: Uh huh. Okay, you almost had me going there for a second.",
        "RORY: Well we did have a ribbon cutting ceremony.",
        "DEAN: So what are you doing Friday night?",
        "RORY: Well, I've got the usual Friday night grandparents' dinner. But I thought maybe if we get back early enough you and I should go watch the bonfire together. I mean, it's kind of corny, but it's really pretty. And they sell star-shaped hot dogs.",
        "DEAN: How about if you get out of dinner at your grandparents' this week?",
        "RORY: I don't think so.",
        "DEAN: Well, what if it's for a really special occasion?",
        "RORY: Well, that special occasion better include my being relocated to a plastic bubble if my grandmother's gonna let me out of dinner.",
        "DEAN: There must be some other excuse that you could use.",
        "RORY: Like what?",
        "DEAN: Like it's your three-month anniversary with your boyfriend.",
        "RORY: It is?",
        "DEAN: Yeah. Three months from your birthday. I mean, that's when I gave you the bracelet and that's when I figured this whole thing kinda started.",
        "RORY: Wow. Three months.",
        "DEAN: Actually, technically your birthday was on a Saturday, so really it should be Saturday, but I work Saturday and I planned out this whole big thing so I thought maybe we could do it on Friday.",
        "RORY: What whole big thing?",
        "DEAN: Just this once. Miss dinner. Please. Don't make me throw myself under a train.",
        "RORY: I'll see what I can do.",
        "DEAN: Thank you.",
        "RORY: You're welcome. It's our three-month anniversary.",
        "DEAN: Yeah it is.",
        "RORY: I feel kind of stupid that I didn't even know about this.",
        "DEAN: That's quite all right.",
        "RORY: I mean, I feel really bad that I missed our two-month anniversary.",
        "DEAN: Quite all right too.",
        "RORY: How was it?",
        "DEAN: Pretty good.",
        "RORY: I'm glad.",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "(Lorelai is sitting at the kitchen table reading a box of Hamburger Helper. Rory walks in.)",
        "RORY: No, put that away.",
        "LORELAI: I wanna cook.",
        "RORY: You can make soup.",
        "LORELAI: No. I wanna really cook like on the Food Channel. I wanna saut\u00e9 thing and chop things and do the BAM, and I wanna arrange things on a plate so they look like a pretty little hat. I wanna be the Iron Chef!",
        "RORY: Fine.",
        "LORELAI: Really?",
        "RORY: Yeah, I'll help.",
        "L: Okay. I need a pan.",
        "R: And a fire extinguisher.",
        "L: Funny, funny girl. Now, if I had only bought some hamburger.",
        "R: You didn't buy hamburger?",
        "L: Yes I bought hamburger. I just like saying things like that so you look at me like I'm crazy.",
        "R: So, tell me, why the sudden need to be domestic?",
        "L: Ah, I don't know. I'm in like a funky mood.",
        "R: Why?",
        "L: Too many stars, too much love, it makes me cranky.",
        "R: I take it you haven't heard from Mr. Medina?",
        "L: Hmm, no. I haven't.",
        "R: Maybe that's why you're cranky.",
        "L: Okay, new subject please.",
        "R: You know, you have a phone also.",
        "L: How's it coming with that pan?",
        "R: Cleopatra, queen of denial.",
        "L: The pan, Chucky. Please.",
        "R: Okay fine. New topic.",
        "L: Thank you.",
        "R: I have this huge favor to ask you.",
        "L: Oh, something I can hold over your head. Let's hear it.",
        "R: Friday night is Dean's and my three-month anniversary.",
        "L: Three months? Wow.",
        "R: And Dean apparently has some big fancy evening planned for us.",
        "L: Very classy of him.",
        "R: Yes it is. But for me to actually partake of the foresaid fancy evening, I have to get out of Friday night dinner.",
        "L: Ah.",
        "R: Yeah.",
        "L: Good luck with that.",
        "R: Mom!",
        "L: Do you know how much Emily Gilmore will not care about your three-month anniversary?",
        "R: I was thinking you could talk to her.",
        "L: If there was a runoff between what Emily Gilmore would care about less, a two-for-one toilet paper sale at Costco or your three month anniversary, your anniversary would win, hands down.",
        "R: So you're not even gonna try to help me?",
        "L: Oh no, I'm gonna try to help you, because I care. Emily Gilmore, however. .",
        "R: Phone please.",
        "L: Okay. [Lorelai walks over to the phone. She laughs.]",
        "R: What?",
        "L: Nothing. It's just, 'Oh, hey Mom, uh, Rory and Dean are having their three month anniversary on Friday.' 'Really Lorelai? Why that's wonderful. I'm thrilled.'",
        "R: Stop.",
        "L: 'Three months. Well, woohoo. Hold on, I'm going to cartwheel.'",
        "R: Forget it.",
        "L: Oh, no wait. She's telling my dad now. Why, I think they're cabbage patching.",
        "R: That's it. Find your own pan.",
        "EMILY: Hello?",
        "L: Mom?",
        "EMILY: Lorelai?",
        "L: Uh, yes, hi.",
        "EMILY: Hello.",
        "L: Hi. How are you doing?",
        "EMILY: I'm doing fine.",
        "L: That's good.",
        "EMILY: I'm pleased.",
        "L: How's Dad?",
        "EMILY: What do you want Lorelai?",
        "L: Um, I was just calling to say hello.",
        "EMILY: And now you have.",
        "L: Okay, good.",
        "EMILY: Was there anything else that you wanted to add to that hello?",
        "L: Well, as a matter of fact, there is.",
        "EMILY: Ah ha.",
        "L: Um, you know Rory.",
        "EMILY: Yes, I believe I do.",
        "L: She wanted to say hello too.",
        "EMILY: Lorelai, I'm late for a meeting. I'd love to know why.",
        "L: Mom, just hear me out, okay, and don't say anything. Um, see Friday night is Rory and Dean's three-month anniversary, and while that might not seem like a very big deal to you, it is to them. And I'm gonna ask you to do something you are so not gonna wanna do. But I am begging you to look at it from her point of view and maybe, just maybe let her, just this once, not come to dinner on Friday.",
        "EMILY: All right.",
        "L: What?",
        "EMILY: Since this is a special occasion, I suppose it would be fine if Rory missed dinner on Friday.",
        "L: It would?",
        "EMILY: Yes",
        "R: Mom?",
        "L: Are you sure?",
        "EMILY: I believe I am.",
        "L: No arguments?",
        "EMILY: No.",
        "L: Well, she wont be there.",
        "EMILY: I understand.",
        "L: At all.",
        "EMILY: I heard.",
        "L: All night long.",
        "EMILY: I assumed as much.",
        "L: Okay.",
        "EMILY: Okay.",
        "L: All right.",
        "EMILY: Anything else?",
        "L: Uh, you know, she's gonna need some help getting ready for the big night Mom, so I should probably.",
        "EMILY: We'll see you at seven.",
        "L: Okay. Right. Bye.",
        "R: So?",
        "L: The world is officially coming to an end.",

        "LUKE: It's a crazy festival based on a nutty myth about two lunatics, who in all probability did not even exist. And even if they did, probably dropped dead of diphtheria before age 24.

        "RACHEL: Yeah, yeah, well things pretty crazy over there, not a lot of writing time. But I finished up my assignment, and I flew back to Chicago and I was walking through O'Hare, and I look up and there's a plane leaving for Hartford in like 20 minutes, and all of a sudden, I'm on it.",

        "LORELAI: Oh!",
        "RACHEL: That must be a pretty big job.",
        "LORELAI: It is! It's crazy. There's always something happening. Like, we just put these coffee makers in all the rooms, but only half of them work. They just like shake and gurgle, like they're having some kind of a fit. Why were you in the Mideast?",
        "RACHEL: I was doing a photo story, on how Palestinian and Israeli families have been affected by the violence.",
        "LORELAI: Uh huh, well, so you understand about the job pressure.",

        "LORELAI: I'm gonna go.",
        "RACHEL: Please, don't let me drive you away.",

Separated by distance and by parents who did not approve of the union, the young couple dreamed of a day that they could be together. They wrote each other beautiful letters. Letters of longing and passion. Letters full of promises and plans for the future. Soon the separation proved too much for either one of them to bear. So, one night, cold and black with no light to guide them, they both snuck out of their homes and ran away as fast as they could. It was so dark out that they were both soon lost and it seemed as if they would never find each other. Finally, the girl dropped to her knees, tears streaming down her lovely face. 'Oh, my love. Where are you? How will I find you?' Suddenly, a band of stars appeared in the sky. These stars shone so brightly they lit up the entire countryside. The girl jumped to her feet and followed the path of the stars until finally she found herself standing right where the town gazebo is today. And there waiting for her was her one true love, who had also been led here by the blanket of friendly stars. [Camera stops on Miss Patty's dance studio, where she is telling the story to a group of children.] And that, my friends, is the story of how Stars Hollow came to be, and why we celebrate that fateful night every year at about this time. Now, we still have a little time left in our story hour. Who wants to hear about the time I danced in a cage for Tito Puente?"

And see, I'm really sorry that we fought last week, and I'm really sorry that you're so disappointed in me, and I really wish there was something I can do to fix that, but there probably isn't and I can accept that because I am an adult now and I am proud of who I have become. But I am begging you, please, please do not make me go back down there because that guy is boring."
