        "OPEN AT LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "[The phone is ringing. Lorelai rushes down the steps to answer it, but the machine picks up before she can get it.]",
        "LORELAI: [on answering machine] Hey, we're not in, so \u0096 ah, bashed my thumb! Leave a message.",
        "EMILY: I am so tired of this ridiculous machine. I get it every time I call. . .",
        "LORELAI: Oh, that was close.",
        "EMILY: You are Rory are always out. What is it that you do? Is your house that awful you can't be in it? It's too much excitement, if you ask me. . .",
        "LORELAI: Well, what isn't in Emily's rules of conduct?",
        "EMILY: I don't want to talk to a machine, I'll just call you later. [hangs up]",
        "LORELAI: If you had your way, Mother, you'd lock us up like veal. That's what she wants, veal children.",
        "[phone rings again]",
        "LORELAI: [on answering machine] Hey, we're not in, so \u0096 ah, bashed my thumb! Leave a message.",
        "EMILY: It's me again. Listen. . .",
        "LORELAI: You're talking into the machine.",
        "EMILY: Don't forget that my DAR meeting is on Tuesday. Please. . .",
        "LORELAI: It's burned into my brain. It's there forever.",
        "EMILY: . . . it's at three o'clock and all the women are all extremely punctual.",
        "LORELAI: When I'm senile and ga-ga and drooling into a cup, and yet I can't remember my name, I'll still remember that your DAR meeting is that Tuesday.",
        "EMILY: . . . this Tuesday. I'll talk to you about some other things later. [hangs up]",
        "LORELAI: I'm gonna have to be de-programmed by cult de-programmers to get that Tuesday out of my brain.",
        "[phone rings again]",
        "LORELAI: [on answering machine] Hey, we're not in, so \u0096 ah, bashed my thumb! Leave a message.",
        "EMILY: Your phone message is annoying. . .",
        "LORELAI: Unbelievable.",
        "EMILY: Do you know how annoying it is?",
        "LORELAI: I think I have a standard against which to measure it.",
        "EMILY: . . .to it yourself. Have you heard it lately?",
        "LORELAI: I can't because I'm amputating my ears.",
        "EMILY: . . .and that thumb bashing thing, is that a joke? Why is it that your jokes are always. . .",
        "LORELAI: Ah, an earless world, what a dream!",
        "[opening credits]",
        "CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN",
        "[In the dining room, Emily is sitting at a table tasting soups as Lorelai and Sookie stand by watching.]",
        "LORELAI: Haven't you already tasted that one, Mom?",
        "EMILY: Mm.",
        "LORELAI: Twice, you've tasted that soup twice.",
        "EMILY: You're keeping a running count?",
        "LORELAI: I'm morbidly fascinated.",
        "EMILY: Well, Lorelai, when you're tasting anything, the first taste acclimates the palate, the second establishes the foundation, and the third is to make your decision.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, there's going to be a third taste.",
        "EMILY: Isn't that what this is for \u0096 to taste the soups?",
        "LORELAI: Taste them, yes, not to orally deduce their chemical structures.",
        "EMILY: Everything has to be at your pace.",
        "LORELAI: Or at a pace that can't be measured by the number of times the earth circles the sun.",
        "SOOKIE: You know, actually, I've heard that.",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "SOOKIE: One is to acclimate, two is for foundation, and three to judge.",
        "LORELAI: Traitor.",
        "EMILY: The women in my DAR group are very picky. My God, when the pate at the meeting Heddy Cubbington organized was slightly less chilled than appropriate, she was ostracized for a month.",
        "LORELAI: Well, that hussy Heddy had it coming.",
        "EMILY: Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: [to employee] Oh, gosh, they're on time for once, good. Hey, do me a favor and, uh, tell Michel that on Wednesday. . .",
        "EMILY: Lorelai, please.",
        "LORELAI: Thanks. Um, Mom, I got a lot of other things happening here that can't come to a grinding halt for this.",
        "EMILY: So your full attention for a short period is too much to ask for?",
        "LORELAI: Mom, I'm already giving you more attention than I would someone in these circumstances. No one else would get eight separate soups to taste for a lousy DAR. . .sorry, a not lousy DAR meeting. We only do this for weddings.",
        "EMILY: Well, would you like me to pay for the tasting?",
        "LORELAI: No, Mom, just decide in this calendar year.",
        "SOOKIE: Hey, can I. . .I'm sorry. The mushroom is a great choice. It's super popular, and it's my Jackson's favorite.",
        "EMILY: Whose?",
        "SOOKIE: Jackson, my fianc\u00e9.",
        "EMILY: Oh, you're getting married?",
        "SOOKIE: To the best man in the world.",
        "LORELAI: Oh hey, while we're on the subject, um, bridesmaids outfits?",
        "SOOKIE: Ooh, I'm way ahead of you. I've already got a couple of ideas.",
        "LORELAI: Is one of them having me design and make them so I don't secretly hate what you pick and then harbor a secret grudge against you for the rest of our lives?",
        "SOOKIE: It is now.",
        "LORELAI: I'll do it!",
        "SOOKIE: We're a good team.",
        "MICHEL: That fellow's on the phone from the restaurant.",
        "LORELAI: Who?",
        "MICHEL: The flannel man with the protruding ankles.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, Luke?",
        "MICHEL: I forgot his name from the desk to here, that's how memorable he is.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, thank you.",
        "EMILY: Where are you going?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, to talk to Luke.",
        "EMILY: Can't you call him back?",
        "LORELAI: Have your third taste, Mom. [leaves]",
        "EMILY: Lorelai! Is she always this scattered?",
        "SOOKIE: She's the stablest person I know.",
        "EMILY: That's very sad. Well, I think you're right, mushroom.",
        "SOOKIE: Great.",
        "EMILY: So, tell me more about your wedding.",
        "SOOKIE: Oh, I've just started planning so there's not that much to tell.",
        "EMILY: Well, have you decided on anything yet? The location or the music for the ceremony, maybe?",
        "SOOKIE: Oh, we'll probably just, you know, wind up playing something off a CD.",
        "EMILY: Oh.",
        "SOOKIE: What?",
        "EMILY: Well, CD's can be very unreliable. They break sometimes, or they skip, or the person assigned to turn them on and off gets distracted and the whole ceremony is ruined.",
        "SOOKIE: I hadn't thought of that.",
        "EMILY: Have you thought about live music?",
        "SOOKIE: Well. . .",
        "EMILY: A nice string ensemble.",
        "SOOKIE: Ooh, that sounds nice.",
        "EMILY: There are a couple of wonderful groups I could recommend.",
        "SOOKIE: Sure. I mean, I guess it doesn't hurt to check them out.",
        "EMILY: No, it doesn't. Mushroom soup.",
        "SOOKIE: String quartet.",

        "LUKE: Yeah, hi.",
        "LORELAI: Hello.",
        "LUKE: How's it going?",
        "LORELAI: Pretty good, pretty good. How's things with you?",
        "LUKE: Oh, not bad. Dropped some eggs.",
        "LORELAI: Bummer.",
        "LUKE: Hazard of the business. Am I catching you at a bad time?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, no, it's kind of slow here. So slow, in fact, that Michel and I were about to get the tetherball out.",
        "LUKE: That's the thing with a ball tethered to a rope?",
        "LORELAI: Hey, I never knew that's where the tether comes from.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, it's tethered. It's tied, like an anchor is tethered to a rope on a boat.",
        "LORELAI: Neat, neat.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, most people probably don't put that together.",
        "LORELAI: Probably not.",
        "LUKE: Yeah.",
        "LORELAI: So, anything else?",
        "LUKE: Uh, yeah, actually \u0096 if I needed a room or two for a couple of days, would that be possible?",
        "LORELAI: You need rooms?",
        "LUKE: Like nine.",
        "LORELAI: You need nine rooms?",
        "LUKE: Just for a couple of days, Wednesday and Thursday.",
        "LORELAI: Uh, well, I can take care of that. What's it for?",
        "LUKE: Uh, just got some family coming in.",
        "LORELAI: Reunion? \u0091Cause we can get the tetherball out.",
        "LUKE: Nah, funeral.",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "LUKE: Yeah, my Uncle Louie died last night and I'm arranging the funeral for him.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, Luke, I'm so sorry. Here I was babbling about tetherball.",
        "LUKE: And you weren't babbling.",
        "LORELAI: Well, you've got nine rooms, Wednesday and Thursday.",
        "LUKE: You sure?",
        "LORELAI: It's a done deal.",
        "LUKE: Thanks.",
        "LORELAI: Luke, I'm so, so sorry.",
        "LUKE: It's okay. It sounds like he went peaceful. He was eighty-five.",
        "LORELAI: But it's always hard. Um, are you okay?",
        "LUKE: Yeah, I'm okay.",
        "LORELAI: Can I help you with anything else?",
        "LUKE: No, the rooms are help enough.",
        "LORELAI: Are you sure, \u0091cause I'm dealing with my mom now and I'd be happy to rush over and help with whatever. You'd be doing me a favor.",
        "LUKE: The rooms are all I need, thanks.",
        "LORELAI: You're welcome.",
        "LUKE: Well, I gotta go.",
        "LORELAI: Call if you need anything.",
        "LUKE: I will. By the way, that French guy's a putz.",
        "LORELAI: Oh yeah, he knows.",
        "LUKE: All right, see ya.",
        "LORELAI: Bye.",

        "LORELAI: I know.",
        "RORY: Was Luke, like, shaken over his uncle dying?",
        "LORELAI: I don't know. He's so unflappable. It's hard to tell.",
        "RORY: The man definitely can't be flapped.",

        "LORELAI: Hey, whatcha doing? Watch, watch it.",
        "LUKE: Ah, buh buh buh. . .thanks, thanks, I'm on the phone.",
        "LORELAI: We noticed.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, I can't serve and be on the phone.",
        "RORY: We noticed that, too.",
        "LORELAI: But your reenactment of Jerry Lewis in The Diner Guy is gonna wow the critics.",

        "LUKE: No.",
        "LORELAI: You should number your tables.",
        "LUKE: What good would that do? If I said a number, you wouldn't know what table was what number.",
        "LORELAI: But all restaurants number their table. You should number your tables.",
        "LUKE: Table five, they go to table five.",
        "LORELAI: Cool. Which one is that?",

        "RORY: Luke needs you downstairs.",
        "JESS: Why?",
        "RORY: Because he's on the phone with someone and Caesar's off today and the place is packed and he needs help.",

        "LORELAI: For Louie?",
        "LUKE: Yeah, he just wanted me to make sure he got a proper funeral. You know, respectful, dignified.",
        "LORELAI: No horseshoe carnation wreaths, got it. Good man, that dad of yours.",
        "LUKE: And since Louie's a war veteran, the town Revolutionary War reenactors will attend the service, do the salute thing, you know. I mean, it makes me nauseous, but my dad wanted it. [on phone] Yeah, hi, I'm still here. . .Yes, the deceased is Louie Danes. . .Right. . .No, Hartford's not too far, I can do that. Thanks. [hangs up] Great, that's done. Uh, okay, I should probably go pick out a coffin before he gets here.",

        "TAYLOR: Let go of me!",
        "PROPRIETOR: Don't like to be touched, that's cool. Got a little David and Lisa thing happening? Made a mental note, no problem. Can I help you find something?",

        "TAYLOR: There must be some mistake \u0096 this just isn't right.",
        "PROPRIETOR: It's all approved by the proper authorities. I followed the rules, it's what my father taught me. Cop for twenty years, got shot in the butt. Good man \u0096 tips over sometimes when he sits \u0096 but good man.",
        "MRS. CASSINI: Beautiful sprouts.",
