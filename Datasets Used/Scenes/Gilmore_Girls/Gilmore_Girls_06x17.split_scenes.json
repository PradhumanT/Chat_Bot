        "Rory forgives Logan for his indiscretions, then needs some time for herself, so she pays a visit to Lorelai in Stars Hollow. Although Lorelai refuses to admit that she is upset, Rory can tell that she is bothered by the news that Luke will be gone for a few days on a field trip with his daughter, April. Against Lorelai's wishes, Rory pays a visit to the store owned by April's mother to spy on her. Meanwhile, when Zack finally works up the courage to ask Mrs. Kim for permission to marry Lane, he is surprised at the deal she makes with him."

        "PARIS: I say we repaint.",
        "RORY: Did you ever paint?",
        "PARIS: No, Doyle doesn't believe in improving someone else's property.",
        "RORY: Men!",
        "PARIS: Yeah, men.",
        "RORY: Well, we will repaint.",
        "PARIS: A new color scheme for a new era.",
        "RORY: I'll eat to that.",
        "[They toast by knocking chopsticks together]",
        "PARIS: Hey this is gonna be great. You and me and a freshly painted apartment, no men -- just lots and lots of Chinese food.",
        "RORY: We are going to get huge.",
        "PARIS: That's okay. We'll get a treadmill.",
        "RORY: Yeah, you always wanted a treadmill.",
        "PARIS: I did. Doyle thought, \"why get a treadmill when you can walk outside?\"",
        "RORY: With all the murderers and rapists.",
        "PARIS: Exactly what I would say. I'm glad you're back.",
        "RORY: Me too... You know, Paris, I'm really sorry about the whole editorship thing.",
        "PARIS: It's okay.",
        "RORY: I didn't lobby for the job. I mean, I swear I had no idea.",
        "PARIS: Forget it. I mean, who are we kidding? I am not cut out to deal with people. I was made to be in a lab or an operating room or a bunker somewhere with a well-behaved monkey by my side. I'm sorry, too, you know, for throwing you out.",
        "RORY: Consider it even.",
        "[Knock on door]",

        "RORY: I don't want to talk to him.",
        "PARIS: I got it. [Paris gets up and opens the door] Well, well, if it isn't new haven's favorite whore hound.",
        "LOGAN: Is Rory here?",
        "PARIS: Yes.",
        "LOGAN: Can I talk to her?",
        "PARIS: No. You can talk to me. [She shuts the door to unchain it] What do you want to talk about -- life, love, common symptoms of sexually transmitted diseases?",
        "LOGAN: Rory.",
        "PARIS: Rashes, sores, insanity.",
        "LOGAN: Five minutes, please!",
        "PARIS: You know, there's a few things I've always wanted to say to you, but out of respect for my friend Rory here, I've refrained. However, the circumstances seem to have changed.",
        "LOGAN: You don't know what you're talking about Paris...",
        "PARIS: I know you cheated on Rory.",
        "LOGAN: I did not cheat on Rory.",
        "PARIS: Are you going to deny it? Are you serious?",
        "LOGAN: We were apart.",
        "PARIS: Oh, please!",
        "LOGAN: We were! We weren't together! And why the hell am I arguing with you? I don't want you back.",
        "PARIS: You, Logan Huntzberger, are nothing but a two-bit, [he tries to push past Paris] spoiled waste of a trust fund. You offer nothing to women or the world in general. If you were to disappear from the face of the earth tomorrow, the only person that would miss you is your Porsche dealer.",
        "LOGAN: Want to chime in here?",
        "RORY: No, I think Paris has got it covered.",
        "LOGAN: [Pushing his way past Paris] Okay, that's it.",
        "PARIS: Wait! Hey!",
        "LOGAN: Rory, I just need 60 seconds.",
        "RORY: Go away, Logan.",
        "PARIS: No one invited you in. Get out right now before I go Bonaduce on your ass.",
        "LOGAN: I'm not going anywhere. I', not going anywhere. We're gonna talk.",
        "DOYLE: What the hell is this door doing unlocked?",
        "PARIS: What are you doing here?",
        "DOYLE: [shuts the door] I want to talk to you.",
        "PARIS: I told you to go.",
        "DOYLE: You did, and I did. I left, and I got drunk, and I thought about why I left and got drunk, and I realized that you are wrong.",
        "PARIS: I am not! And what are you wearing?",
        "DOYLE: Don't change the subject!",
        "LOGAN: [to Rory] Can we go in the other room?",
        "DOYLE: We're supposed to be together, Paris. You know it, I know it, your life coach knows it.",
        "PARIS: Terrence has been wrong before. When I wanted to get the pageboy haircut, remember?",
        "DOYLE: Paris, listen to me. I'm the best thing that ever happened to you.",
        "PARIS: Well, if that's true, then it's all uphill from here.",
        "DOYLE: I didn't have to come back here begging you to talk to me. I have options.",
        "PARIS: Right.",
        "DOYLE: I do! In fact, I almost hooked up with a really hot chick tonight.",
        "RORY: I don't see how that's gonna help your case, Doyle, at all. [to Logan] Know what Fine. Let's take this out into the hall.",
        "PARIS: You could have hooked up with a hot chick?",
        "DOYLE: Yes.",
        "PARIS: In rhinestone buttons? Who was it -- Sheila E.?",
        "[in the hall]",
        "RORY: Two minutes. Go.",
        "LOGAN: Look, I understand that you're upset, and I really wish you hadn't found out like that, but I love you. You know that I love you. When I said that I was your boyfriend, I agreed to be faithful to you, which was a first for me. And I thought it was gonna be hard, but it wasn't. Then I asked you to move in with me, I asked you to move in with me, and I thought that was gonna be hard, but it wasn't. I have been completely faithful to you, Rory. I have not been with another girl.",
        "RORY: Ha!",
        "LOGAN: I've not even thought about another girl.",
        "RORY: Except for Walker, Alexandra...",
        "LOGAN: We were broken up, Rory.",
        "RORY: No, you were.",
        "LOGAN: I thought we were broken up. I thought that's what the fight was. I thought that's what the separation was. Do you believe me? Do you believe that I honestly thought we weren't together?",
        "RORY: I guess.",
        "LOGAN: So then, if you believe that, that I thought we weren't together, then do you believe that, in my mind, I was not cheating on you?",
        "RORY: I guess.",
        "LOGAN: So then if you believe that, in my mind, I was not cheating on you, do you think you can forget what those vipers said today, put it behind you, and just come home with me? Come on, Rory. Just come home with me. Let's forget this crappy day ever happened, just go home. [pause] You want to make a pro/con list?",
        "RORY: Do not mock my pro/con list.",
        "LOGAN: I am not mocking your pro/con list. I actually think the list will come out in my favor.",
        "RORY: [Sighs] Well, I'd have to tell Paris I'm going.",
        "LOGAN: Absolutely, tell Paris you're going.",
        "RORY: [opens the apartment door] Whoa! Oh!",
        "LOGAN: What?",
        "RORY: They made up. Either that or Krav Maga is way kinkier than I thought it was.",
        "LOGAN: Well, you can tell her tomorrow. After all, it is tomorrow.",
        "RORY: Yeah, yeah, I can just call her from home.",

        "LUKE: [puts his hand up] Okay. [Lorelai look amusingly at his hand] Call you later. [hangs up the phone.",
        "LORELAI: Did you not hear me screaming?",
        "LUKE: You were screaming?",
        "LORELAI: Yes like Janet Leigh in \"psycho.\"",
        "LUKE: I was one the phone, why were you screaming?",
        "LORELAI: There was a spider in the shower. I trapped him under a soap dish. I need you to go in and get him and take him outside.",
        "LUKE: Right.",
        "LORELAI: Scoop him up gently. You do not want to break his little legs. Spiders are all about their legs. [takes a breath] I was shampooing. Everything was fine. I looked up, and there he was!",
        "LUKE: Holy mackerel.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, he's a big boy. Don't hurt him.",
        "LUKE: I won't.",
        "LORELAI: I was talking to the spider. [Sighs...something crashes in the bath room] What happened? Are you okay?",
        "LUKE: Yeah, he's got a posse.",
        "LORELAI: You're kidding.",
        "LUKE: Arr, I am not kidding.",
        "LORELAI: What are you gonna do?",
        "LUKE: There isn't a soap dish in town big enough for these guys.",
        "LORELAI: Be careful.",
        "LUKE: I just got to trap them, move them out of the shower, and then sell the building.",
        "LORELAI: Ha.",
        "LUKE: So, that was April on the phone.",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "LUKE: April called. Seems their math team made it into some national contest.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, well, good for her.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, it's pretty big. They're all going to Philadelphia next week. Bunch of the parents are supposed to chaperone. Anna was gonna go, but now she can't, so April called me.",
        "LORELAI: Oh.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, it's weird, 'cause usually it's me calling her to do things. This is the first time that she's called me.",
        "LORELAI: Well, good. That's progress, right?",
        "LUKE: I think so, but I can't take a week off from the diner. Plus, you and I probably have all sorts of plans next week.",
        "LORELAI: Not that we I of, oh, wait was next week the week we were gonna start our lives as outlaws?",
        "LUKE: Well, I just assumed we had stuff to do next week.",
        "LORELAI: No.",
        "LUKE: Oh.",
        "LORELAI: You should go.",
        "LUKE: You think?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, she asked you. She called you and I know that traveling across country in a bus full of little man Tates has been a lifelong dream of yours.",
        "LUKE: Well, okay. I think I will go.",
        "LORELAI: Good.",
        "LUKE: Yeah you know I looked up the route last night. Sounds like a great trip. They'll be visiting constitution hall and stopping in Gettysburg. Do you know I have never seen the liberty bell?",
        "LORELAI: Communist.",
        "LUKE: Okay I'm gonna take these guys outside. Any particular place you want them?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, someplace shady, shelter from the elements and, ideally, near a talking pig.",
        "LUKE: I asked. I have no one to blame but myself.",
        "THE BANDS APARTMENT",
        "[Zach and Brian are playing a video came, Lane is unpacking]",
        "ZACH: There's still a glare, right?",
        "BRIAN: Huge glare, I can't make out all the details of castle siege.",
        "ZACH: And those trolls, you've got to squint to see them.",
        "LANE: The TV's fine, guys. It's in exactly the same place it used to be.",
        "ZACH: Dude, wait till you hear how I soundproofed Lane's old room. Pier 1 cushions wall-to-wall, perfect acoustics.",
        "LANE: Band practice officially starts back up tomorrow.",
        "ZACH: Dude, you want this bottom drawer, too?",
        "BRIAN: Sure, a sock drawer.",
        "ZACH: Nothing is gayer than a sock drawer.",
        "BRIAN: Really, there's got to be something gayer than a sock drawer.",
        "LANE: Okay, before you guys get too deeply entrenched in the \"what's gayer than a sock drawer\" conversation, I'm gonna say goodbye. [kisses Zach] Goodbye.",
        "ZACH: Goodbye.",
        "LANE: Bye, Brian.",
        "BRIAN: Bye, Lane. Thanks for the help.",
        "LANE: Hey, make sure you behave yourself out there. You're almost a married woman.",
        "BRIAN: Hey, what happens when you guys get married?",
        "ZACH: Well, we finally get to have s*x.",
        "LANE: [embarrassed and quietly] Zack.",
        "BRIAN: No, I mean, I just moved in here. But when you guys get married, do I move out again?",
        "[Lane and Zach look at each other]",
        "LANE: We haven't really discussed that yet.",
        "ZACH: Yeah, well, we can move the band equipment back out here, me and Lane will take the room. You can have the bunk beds all to yourself.",
        "BRIAN: Cool!",
        "LANE: Ah Zach, don't you think we should get our own apartment when we get married?",
        "ZACH: But this is a great apartment.",
        "LANE: I know this is a great apartment.",
        "BRIAN: I thought you liked Brian.",
        "LANE: I do. I just think maybe we'd want our own place.",
        "ZACH: Our own place? Okay. Wow. I tell you, this marriage thing major. Every day, something huge to think about.",
        "LANE: Speaking of huge, you need to talk to my mom.",
        "BRIAN: You haven't told Mrs. Kim yet?",
        "ZACH: Don't worry I'm heading over there today.",
        "LANE: You are? Are you ready? You have a clean shirt? You sewed up your pants?",
        "ZACH: Everything's under control, hunter and gatherer and all that crap. Go to work. Okay. Call me the minute you talk to her. [they kiss again, then Lane leaves]",
        "BRIAN: You got yourself a good woman there.",
        "ZACH: Yep, I do. You are officially moved back in.",
        "BRIAN: Cool. [they look at the TV] Hey wasn't the TV facing the other way?",
        "ZACH: Yes that's it. It's good to have you home man. It's good to have you home. [They more the TV and agree it's right now \"Oh, yeah\".]",
        "LUKE'S DINER",
        "[Lorelai enters]",
        "LORELAI: Hey, when you come over later tonight, I have a cricket cornered under a paper cup in the living room. I poked holes in the top, so he could breath and then I taped it to the floor 'cause he kept jumping out. And I put books on top of the tape, incase it wasn't sticky enough so don't move the books until you're ready for transport. What are you doing?",
        "LUKE: I'm sewing my duffel bag.",
        "LORELAI: That's crazy.",
        "LUKE: That's crazy?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah that thing's 100 years old. Just throw it away.",
        "LUKE: The bag is fine.",
        "LORELAI: That is not a bag. That is a collection of molecules tethered together by dirt.",
        "LUKE: I'll get you your coffee in a minute.",
        "LORELAI: Luke, come on. You're going on a major trip next week. Spring for some real luggage.",
        "LUKE: I don't need any luggage.",
        "LORELAI: I'll go shopping with you. We can hit the mall later.",
        "LUKE: I don't want to go shopping. I don't want to hit the mall. I will fix this bag, and it will be fine.",
        "LORELAI: All right I'll so shopping alone I can pick something out for you.",
        "LUKE: I appreciate the offer, but I'm fine. Ow! [he pricks him self with the needle.",
        "LANE: Ooh, that's the third time he's stabbed himself this morning.",
        "LORELAI: Maybe we should put him on suicide watch.",
        "LANE: Couldn't hurt.",
        "LUKE: Hey, there's customers to talk to if you're lonely. Ow!",
        "LORELAI: I can't believe you think shopping is more painful than this!",
        "LANE: Oh, I'll be right back.",
        "[Lane goes out side]",
        "LANE: Rory, I can't believe you're here!",
        "RORY: Oh, I just thought I'd, whoa! Wow, these small towns are mighty friendly.",
        "LANE: I have some really, really big news.",
        "RORY: What? [Lane shows Rory the ring[ You've become a Shriner.",
        "LORELAI: Bleeding stop yet?",
        "LUKE: It's fine.",
        "LORELAI: You sure you don't want me to call an ambulance, or a Tumi store? [Lorelai here's the girls shrieking outside] Rory's here!",
        "LUKE: She is?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, she's outside bouncing around with Lane.",
        "LUKE: How come she came home?",
        "LORELAI: I don't know, bouncing lessons?",
        "RORY: Did you hear?",
        "LORELAI: Did I hear what?",
        "RORY: Show her, show her, show her!",
        "LORELAI: You won the super bowl?",
        "LANE: I'm engaged.",
        "LORELAI: No!",
        "RORY: Yes!",
        "LORELAI: Let me see the ring again.",
        "LANE: It's all Zach could afford, but I think it's rock 'n' roll. It's the rocking and the rolling-est. I'm so excited for you, Lane. That's awesome!",
        "LANE: Thanks I would have told you earlier, but I thought you knew.",
        "LORELAI: Why would I know?",
        "LANE: Well Luke was standing right there when it happened.",
        "LORELAI: You knew?",
        "LUKE: Um, yeah.",
        "LORELAI: Did you forget to tell me?",
        "LUKE: No, I just thought that Lane would want to tell you herself.",
        "LORELAI: You forgot to tell me.",
        "LUKE: Fine, sure. I forgot to tell you. So what? I remember being engaged to you. Isn't that enough?",
        "CUSTOMER: Can I get some more coffee?",
        "LANE: I'll be right back.",
        "RORY: Oh, I am so hungry. Do you think Luke would be willing to make us S'mores today?",
        "LORELAI: Hey, for you, anything. So, nice surprise.",
        "RORY: What Lane?",
        "LORELAI: No, you showing up. I didn't expect it, you being such a modern, busy woman and all.",
        "RORY: Well, I can bring home the bacon and fry it up in a pan.",
        "LORELAI: So, any special occasion I should know about?",
        "RORY: No, I just thought I could use a good Stars Hollow fix for a couple days. How crazy are things at the inn?",
        "LORELAI: Absolutely insane. However, for you, I can play a little hooky.",
        "RORY: What a role model.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I try. So, what's new? You okay?",
        "RORY: Yeah, why?",
        "LORELAI: Well, Logan and moving out.",
        "RORY: Oh, right. About that. Remember the new address?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah.",
        "RORY: Cross it out. I'm back to the old one.",
        "LORELAI: What? Back at Logan's?",
        "RORY: Yeah.",
        "LORELAI: How did this happen?",
        "RORY: He came over to Paris' last night, and we talked. He explained everything.",
        "LORELAI: So there's an explanation?",
        "RORY: Yeah, and we're fine now.",
        "LORELAI: You're fine. But what about the bridesmaids?",
        "RORY: Misunderstanding. Everything's good.",
        "LUKE: Here, start on these. I'm making you some S'mores.",
        "RORY: He's the most beautiful man in the world.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, you should see him carry a spider outside.",
        "DRAGONFLY INN - FRONT DESK",
        "[Rory is on her cell phone and Michel is behind the desk]",
        "RORY: A.K., It's a lacrosse piece. It's fine. Well I'm sorry I can't give you more feedback, but until five minutes ago, I didn't even know Yale had a Lacrosse team. So when I criticize a piece, you think I hate it. When I don't criticize a piece, you think I hate it. Do you want me to hate you, A.K.? Because it's becoming a possibility. Wonderful, in that case, I will continue to be a fan of you and your work. Goodbye.",
        "MICHEL: You're quite the busy bee.",
        "RORY: Oh, yeah, well, writers can be temperamental.",
        "MICHEL: I'm sure... You like neon?",
        "RORY: Sorry?",
        "MICHEL: I see you're making liberal use of my pink neon post-it notes.",
        "RORY: I'm sorry. Would you like me to reimburse you for the seven pink neon post-it notes that I have used? 'Cause I'd be happy to if you can break a penny.",
        "MICHEL: No, little Lorelai, it's not the cost that is the problem. It's the disruption.",
        "RORY: Disruption?",
        "MICHEL: Of the system.",
        "RORY: I see.",
        "MICHEL: Do you?",
        "RORY: No.",
        "MICHEL: The pink neon post-it notes are used for guests who are checking in. The green neon post-it notes are for guests checking out. And the watermelon post-it notes are for guests who have altered or cancelled their reservations. As you can see, the pink neon stack is now woefully out of balance with the green neon stack, creating the illusion that more guests have been checking in than checking out, which, of course, is a physical impossibility unless we have begun murdering them.",
        "LORELAI: [They are stare at each other as Lorelai enters the room,] Are you guys having a staring contest? 'Cause I think for it to be official, you have to be seated.",
        "MICHEL: I was just filling your daughter in on the inner workings of the dragonfly.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, what did she do?",
        "RORY: I took some post-its.",
        "LORELAI: But the system!",
        "RORY: It will never happen again.",
        "LORELAI: Michel, you have my deep and sincere apology. She was raised better than that. [slaps Rory on the wrist]",
        "RORY: Oh, actually, I did it with the other hand. [Lorelai slaps the other wrist]",
        "MICHEL: I'm going on my break.",
        "RORY: He seems good.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, it's the yoga. [cell phone rings] So, you ready for the movie?",
        "RORY: Yeah. Let me get my stuff.",

        "EMILY: And this GPS contraption your father insisted on buying is speaking German.",

        "LORELAI: Still yelling.",

        "EMILY: So every time we want to ask the machine for directions, we have to pull over to the side of the road?",
        "RICHARD: It would appear so. I thought the point of the machine was to avoid pulling over to ask directions.",

        "LORELAI: Apparently, there's a fight to the death between Richard and Emily and an evil German supercomputer.",

I mean what's next, the radio won't turn on if it doesn't like the song? The engine won't start if the cup of coffee I'm holding is too hot? Maybe the car won't go in reverse if it doesn't like my perfume?",
        "RICHARD: At the moments Emily, I would be happy if I could just get the damn thing to stop barking at me in German.",

I don't mean hot, like, in a slutty way. She's beautiful and cool and an awesome drummer. Now I know you may have questions, and I totally get that, so I brought some stuff to answer them. First thing, I'm a good worker. That's a letter of recommendation from my manager at Quest Copying. Notice the part where he wrote, \"Zach's a good worker.\" I didn't tell him to say that. He doesn't dig me that much personally, so you know he means it. I'm also in line for a promotion, assistant manager, which comes with medical benefits, so I can buy cheap medicine and get my teeth cleaned and stuff. That's my latest bank statement. It's not a lot, I know, but it grows a little every month well, except for maybe this month. The doorknob's gonna set me back a bit.",

So I started thinking, \"what would I like -- mustard with onions or ketchup without?\" And then, suddenly, they both started to sound really good. But I usually get my hot dogs with ketchup and relish. And you don't just walk out on something that has served you so well for so long. So three hot dogs it is.

Those 30 miles act as buffer so that when my mother says something that makes me want to kill her, I have to drive 30 miles to do it. 10 miles in, I usually calm down or I get hungry or I pass a mall, something prevents me from actually killing her.

Now I know you may have questions, and I totally get that, so I brought some stuff to answer them. First thing, I'm a good worker. That's a letter of recommendation from my manager at Quest Copying. Notice the part where he wrote, \"Zach's a good worker.\" I didn't tell him to say that. He doesn't dig me that much personally, so you know he means it. I'm also in line for a promotion, assistant manager, which comes with medical benefits, so I can buy cheap medicine and get my teeth cleaned and stuff. That's my latest bank statement.
