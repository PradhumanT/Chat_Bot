        "LORELAI: How can you possibly say she looked better with the dark hair?",
        "RORY: She did the blonde just seemed like she was trying to be her sister.",
        "LORELAI: The dark hair makes it look like she's trying not to look like her, plus she does not have the nose for dark hair.",
        "RORY: What does that mean?",
        "LORELAI: Dark hair is like a giant light-up arrow pointing to what is wrong with you. Blond hair, it all sort of blends in in a haze of beige.",
        "RORY: Nuts, you're nuts.",
        "LORELAI: You're double nuts!",
        "EMILY: All right, that's it. No more spaghetti and meatballs. Musepa, come get these plates.",
        "LORELAI: Mom!",
        "EMILY: Every time we have spaghetti and meatballs, you fight.",
        "LORELAI: No, no, we're not fighting. We're just, uh, bonding.",
        "RORY: [Trying to eat] Mmm! Grandma, I'm starving!",
        "EMILY: Take these away, Mr. Gilmore's also.",
        "LORELAI: Mom, come on.",
        "RORY: I won't fight anymore.",
        "EMILY: No. Spaghetti and meatballs is just too much excitement.",
        "RICHARD: [Entering the room] I'm sorry about that. I left work early today, and apparently, that caused everyone's I.Q.S to drop 60 points. My food is gone.",
        "EMILY: The girls were fighting.",
        "RICHARD: I told you not to serve spaghetti and meatballs. They always fight when we have spaghetti and meatballs.",
        "LORELAI: That's not true.",
        "RORY: We fight just as much when we have Chinese food.",
        "EMILY: Can we please talk about something besides food?",
        "LORELAI: Starvation, scurvy, the Donner party.",
        "EMILY: I'm having Lasik surgery on my eyes.",
        "RICHARD: Excellent topic.",
        "LORELAI: Lasik surgery? Why?",
        "EMILY: Well I hate wearing glasses, so I found the best doctor on the east coast, made an appointment, and I'm going in tomorrow.",
        "RICHARD: Personally, I like you with glasses.",
        "LORELAI: It's that whole \"dirty librarian\" thing, right, dad?",
        "RICHARD: I beg your pardon.",
        "EMILY: Three of the girls in my D.A.R. Group had it done already. I'm actually very excited about it. I got Dr. Morris...",
        "RICHARD: The Lasik man.",
        "EMILY: ...From Dr. Sugarman, who's my ear, nose, and throat man. And he said Dr. Morris is brilliant and very, very handsome.",
        "RICHARD: You never told me this.",
        "EMILY: He just threw it in at the end of the visit.",
        "RICHARD: I think that's incredibly unprofessional.",
        "EMILY: Oh, Richard, he just was saying the man is handsome.",
        "RICHARD: Yes, as if it's a selling point.",
        "LORELAI: It can be.",
        "RICHARD: Hardly. Everyone knows ugly men make the best doctors.",
        "EMILY: That's absurd.",
        "RICHARD: It's a fact.",
        "EMILY: Marcus Welby was handsome and George Clooney.",

        "RICHARD: You are not going shopping to get something new to wear to Dr. Handsome.",
        "LORELAI: Everyone is a little testy tonight.",
        "RORY: Maybe she was right about the spaghetti and meatballs.",
        "EMILY: Well, let's just talk about something else. We had lunch with Christopher yesterday.",
        "LORELAI: You...",
        "RORY: [Thinking of food] Lunch.",
        "RICHARD: We took him to the club.",
        "LORELAI: [Panicked] Okay, but why?",
        "RICHARD: Because there'd been a lot of tension between us about the tuition incident, and your mother and I thought it was time for a sit-down.",
        "LORELAI: A sit down what, did you get Clemenza to hide a gun in the bathroom first?",
        "RICHARD: We thought it was time to clear the air. After all, Christopher is Rory's father, and we wanted him to know there were no hard feelings.",
        "LORELAI: Really?",
        "EMILY: Don't get me wrong. We're still not happy about the situation, but since he's going to be involved in our lives now...",
        "LORELAI: Whoa, whoa. Involved in your lives? How is he involved in your lives?",
        "EMILY: Well, he's paying for Rory's college.",
        "LORELAI: [defensive] Yeah but is he using your pen to write the check?",
        "RICHARD: Of course not.",
        "LORELAI: Then I don't see how he's involved in your lives. [Gesturing to Rory] He's involved in her life...",
        "EMILY: Lorelai, will you relax? The lunch went fine. It was very pleasant, and Christopher enjoyed it.",
        "RICHARD: That's right. He apologized for everything.",
        "EMILY: He knows that we're no longer angry with him, and we are all friends again.",
        "LORELAI: Well, with friends like these...",
        "RICHARD: And after lunch, your mother and I began discussing what we were going to do with all the money that had been allotted for Rory's tuition.",
        "EMILY: And we came up with a brilliant idea.",
        "RORY: Oh, yeah? What?",
        "RICHARD: We're going to add some funds from our foundation and donate the total amount to Yale university in your name.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "EMILY: That's right, and we'll make sure it goes for something important, like a medical building.",
        "LORELAI: For really handsome doctors.",
        "EMILY: Whatever it is, I want her name big and prominent.",

        "EMILY: The Rory Gilmore observatory.",
        "RORY: ...I still go to Yale, so having something with my name on it might be kind of...",

        "DR SCHULTZ: They're all top-notch.",
        "LOGAN: That's if I need a physical therapist.",
        "RORY: [To Logan] Hush you [To doctor] And you said lots of rest, but is complete bed rest safest?",
        "LOGAN: You cannot confine me to a bed. That's a violation of my rights.",
        "RORY: Hush you.",
        "DR SCHULTZ: You need to monitor his progress. Everyone recovers at different speeds.",
        "RORY: And when you say, \"plenty of fluids,\" does hot tea count, or just water? He likes hot tea.",

        "RORY: No, you'll get g-forces.",
        "LOGAN: Doctor, can I go home to your house? I think I'd have much more fun there.",
        "DR SCHULTZ: Your in good hand, just call if you have any more questions.",
        "RORY: I will. Thank you, Dr. Schultz.",
        "RORY: Okay, so, I cut off an old lady with a handicap sticker, so we got a primo spot right out front. Colin is meeting us at the apartment to help me get you upstairs and in bed, and it's a little cold outside, so you might need a scarf. I should have brought you a scarf. Maybe they have some in the gift shop. I'll go check.",
        "LOGAN: Actually, there's something going on here.",

        "SOOKIE: Hum?",
        "MICHEL: I will call my lawyer, and you'll hear from him when I do. Kiss my tush! Mmm! Damn it! You can trust nothing and no one ever!",
        "LORELAI: Please stop that, Michel.",
        "MICHEL: Oh, I cannot. I cannot stop this for a very, very long time. I buy milk from the organic dairy down the way. The nonfat milk has a blue top, blue. Today I find out that they have accidentally been putting red tops on the nonfat milk and blue on the 2%, 2%! For the last two weeks, I have been drinking 2% milk in my coffee every single day.",
        "LORELAI: Insert gasp here.",
        "MICHEL: That's two full weeks of two cups of coffee a day. It used to be one cup, but then, suddenly, the coffee started tasting so good, I added an afternoon jolt, and now I find out I've been consuming an extra billion calories a week.",
        "LORELAI: At least it hasn't affected your ability to do math. [To Sookie] Isn't this bouncing bothering you?",
        "SOOKIE: It was, but now it's kind of like having a Beyonc\u00e9 video on.",
        "MICHEL: Now I have to burn off all these calories and I have to deal with 2%-fat-milk withdrawal...",
        "LORELAI: Michel, why didn't you just look on the bottle?",

        "LORELAI: Oh, well, things are crazy. You know, we're totally booked up here, and Um Rory has her finals.",
        "LUKE: You're helping Rory with her finals?",

        "LUKE: Okay, well, then, we'll hook up tonight.",

        "LUKE: Staff meeting, I didn't know you had a staff meeting tonight. Did it just come up?",
        "LORELAI: Pretty much.",
        "LUKE: Well, I'm sorry I'm not gonna see you.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, me too.",
        "LUKE: So, tomorrow?",
        "LORELAI: Sure, maybe. We'll talk in the morning.",
        "LUKE: Okay. We'll talk in the morning.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. Well...bye.",
        "SOOKIE: I have to get a babysitter if there's gonna be a staff meeting tonight, and Becky, the good one, is at her grandmother's, so I'll have to use her crazy Goth sister who wears the snake around her neck and eats all my Eggos.",
        "LORELAI: There's no staff meeting tonight.",
        "MICHEL: [Groans] Thank god!",
        "SOOKIE: If there's no staff meeting tonight, why did you tell Luke there was?",

        "JACKSON: It's marijuana.",
        "SOOKIE: [Gasps, happy] Yes! [Shocked] Oh, my god! Jackson, why do you smell like marijuana?",
        "JACKSON: You know that back half-acre that I haven't planted for a few years, up on the slope, out of sight, out of mind? Well, I went back there this morning, and it's a giant field of pot!",
        "SOOKIE: [Gasps]",
        "JACKSON: Every square inch, hundreds of plantings. It looks like Harrison Ford's backyard.",
        "SOOKIE: How did this happen?",
        "JACKSON: The Templeton brothers.",
        "SOOKIE: The Templeton brothers.",
        "JACKSON: They must have planted it right before I fired 'em. I told them to weed the back half-acre. They're not the smartest of fellows.",
        "SOOKIE: They were always listening to the Allman Brothers. We should never hire guys that listen to the Allman Brothers.",
        "JACKSON: What are we gonna do? It's a full half-acre of marijuana!",
        "SOOKIE: Jackson, Shh! We can't keep saying the \"m\" word. Someone will overhear.",

        "SOOKIE: We need a code word.",
        "JACKSON: How about \"evil crop\"?",
        "SOOKIE: Something more normal. Hey, how 'bout \"pickles\"?",
        "JACKSON: Good. We'll say, \"pickles.\" Do you realize that at this moment we are both felons?",
        "SOOKIE: Why? We didn't grow the stuff. [Louder] The pickles! We didn't grow the pickles! Ha!",
        "JACKSON: But we're in possession. If the cops came to my field today, we'd go to jail. We'd lose everything we own. We'd lose the kids.",
        "SOOKIE: All because of pickles.",
        "JACKSON: I'm gonna send my guys home right now. I'm gonna single-handedly pull every last pickle out of there.",
        "SOOKIE: Good. Yes, good and do it quick.",
        "JACKSON: I'll try.",
        "SOOKIE: You're sweating.",
        "JACKSON: I'm sorry. I can't help it.",
        "SOOKIE: It makes you look guilty.",
