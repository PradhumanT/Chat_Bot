        "Since Rory was little, the Gilmore girls have planned her 21st birthday: in Atlantic City, sipping martinis, playing 21. But with the estrangement, Emily plans the birthday party - and it's not Atlantic City. Richard and Emily have their pastor over for dinner and Rory drops the news that she and Logan are having sex. Emily moves Rory back into the main house. At the birthday party, Lorelai and Rory finally talk."

        "[PREVIOUSLY_ON]",
        "(OPEN on Lorelai front porch, night right after the last scene in the previous episode. Richard is standing outside with Lorelai's dollhouse and Lorelai walks out on the porch)",
        "LORELAI: What about Rory?",
        "RICHARD: I don't like what I see in that girl.",
        "LORELAI: My eyes?",
        "RICHARD: She's lost focus. She's drifting, aimless. You know she's joined the DAR?",
        "LORELAI: I saw the picture in the paper.",
        "RICHARD: She's running around, planning tea parties like she's the mad hatter. All she talks about are seating charts and canapes and fund-raisers and that boy.",
        "LORELAI: You mean Logan?",
        "RICHARD: She's heading in the wrong direction, and I don't like it. Now, I've thought long and hard about this, and I've come to a decision. We need a plan.",
        "LORELAI: But...(takes a deep breath) We...I had a plan. You changed the plan. Plan's gone, baby.",
        "RICHARD: I don't appreciate your tone.",
        "LORELAI: Apparently the proper tone went out with the plan.",
        "RICHARD: Do you understand what I'm saying? Rory's not headed back to school.",
        "LORELAI: Not yet, anyhow.",
        "RICHARD: Not yet? Not now, not ever. Listen to me for just a moment. We can fix this. First of all, I can change the terms of Rory's trust fund. Currently, she's set to receive it when she turns twenty-five, but I say we tell her it's contingent on her returning to Yale.",
        "LORELAI: Dad...",
        "RICHARD: Or we can use the opposite approach, if you think it's better. Maybe we offer her a car or the down payment on a town house. Or I'll buy her the town house. Don't you see? If there's something in it for her, maybe we can get her to change her mind.",
        "LORELAI: Thank you for the dollhouse, dad. It's greatly appreciated.",
        "RICHARD: I don't believe this. Aren't you listening to me?",
        "LORELAI: Uh, no.",
        "RICHARD: Lorelai, Rory is turning twenty-one years old in ten days. Do you realize that?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, dad, I realize it.",
        "RICHARD: She's twenty-one. That's not a child. Twenty-one-year-olds need to be working towards something.",
        "LORELAI: Rory will figure it out.",
        "RICHARD: Oh, please, she's twenty-one. I couldn't tie my shoe at twenty-one.",
        "LORELAI: Well, Rory's advanced. She had the shoe thing down at three.",
        "RICHARD: I'm getting a little tired...",
        "LORELAI: No, I'm getting a little tired of this conversation. I'm not interested in your plan. I'm not going to bribe my daughter with cars and money, mainly because it wouldn't work, and if you'd ever met Rory, you would know it wouldn't work. Rory can't be bought, and I'm not gonna try and buy her. I want Rory to want to go back to school. She used to love to learn and read and study. And that was freakish, but it was her. And she's got to get herself back there.",
        "RICHARD: But...",
        "LORELAI: No, when Rory wants help, she will ask for it. And the minute she does, I will fly in faster than the gulfstream I'm sure you're gonna offer to buy her next. But until then, I'm sorry, you're on your own.",
        "RICHARD: Impossible girl.",
        "LORELAI: My native American name, I believe. (Richard leaves frustrated)",
        "OPENING CREDITS",
        "(CUT on Lorelai's front porch, same night. Luke is trying to lift the dollhouse as Lorelai stands near by)",
        "LORELAI: Unbelievable. He's unbelievable.",
        "LUKE: He sure is. How did he lift this thing?",
        "LORELAI: Pretending like it's an accident that Rory's still floundering. Nothing's an accident. He caused this. He made this happen.",
        "LUKE: It must weigh a thousand pounds.",
        "LORELAI: That was a low blow, bringing up Rory's birthday like that. \"She's turning twenty-one, Lorelai. Did you know that?\". (she scoffs) Of course I know that. I was there when she was turning nothing. I know she's turning twenty-one.",
        "LUKE: Does this thing have, like, a real foundation or something?",
        "LORELAI: It's just like my parents, you know, to double-cross me then get mad when I won't help them undo the double cross.",
        "LUKE: Did he have guys with him?",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "LUKE: Guys, to help him lift this thing.",
        "LORELAI: No, no guys.",
        "LUKE: No guys? Your dad is Hercules.",
        "LORELAI: We had plans.",
        "LUKE: (grunts as he tries to pick the dollhouse up) What? (Lorelai sits on the porch rail)",
        "LORELAI: We were gonna go to Atlantic City. We were gonna sit at a blackjack table at 11:59, we were gonna order martinis, and we were gonna be playing 21 when she turned twenty-one. (Luke walks over to her) And then hopefully we'd win, and we'd take our winnings and we'd buy 21 things. And then there was a thing about 21 guys that wouldn't really be appropriate anymore since the engagement, but it was a good plan. (Luke starts to play with Lorelai's hair in a comforting way) She probably doesn't even remember the plan.",
        "LUKE: She remembers the plan.",
        "LORELAI: It wasn't like we talked about it every day. It was just something we thought of.",
        "LUKE: She remembers the plan.",
        "LORELAI: I'm hungry. I'm ordering pizza. (they hug and Luke kisses the top of her head) The top comes off. (Lorelai goes in the house)",
        "LUKE: Of course it does.",
        "(CUT to Rory's room, night. Rory is lying in bed sleeping and the clock says the time is 4:03 in the morning. Madeleine Albright walks over and kisses the top of her head. Rory wakes up and Madeleine Albright lies in bed with Rory)",
        "MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Happy birthday, little girl.",
        "RORY: Hey.",
        "MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: I can't believe how fast you're growing up.",
        "RORY: Really? Feels slow.",
        "MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Trust me, it's fast. So, what do you think of your life so far?",
        "RORY: I think it's pretty good.",
        "MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Any complaints?",
        "RORY: I'd like that whole humidity thing to go away.",
        "MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: I'll work on that.",
        "RORY: So, do I look older?",
        "MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Oh, yeah. Walk into Denny's before five, you got yourself a discount.",
        "RORY: Good deal.",
        "MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: So, you know what I think?",
        "RORY: What?",
        "MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: I think you're a great, cool kid and the best friend a girl could have.",
        "RORY: Back at ya.",
        "MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: And it's so hard to believe that, at exactly this time many moons ago, I was lying in exactly the same position.",
        "RORY: Oh, boy, here we go.",
        "MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Only I had a fat stomach and huge ankles and I was swearing like a sailor...",
        "RORY: ...on leave.",
        "MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: On leave, right. And there I was...",
        "RORY: ...in labour...",
        "MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: ...and while there's some who call it the most meaningful experience of their life...",
        "RORY: ...you compare it to something more akin to doing the splits on a crate of dynamite.",
        "MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Right.",
        "RORY: I wonder if the Waltons ever did this.",
        "(CUT to Rory and Logan in bed, continuous. Rory wakes up - so obviously she was dreaming. Logan wakes up a bit too)",
        "LOGAN: What?",
        "RORY: I just had a dream that Madeleine Albright was my mother.",
        "LOGAN: Hmm. (Logan falls back to sleep. Rory sighs and follows his lead, looking a bit preoccupied)",
        "(CUT to Stars Hollow outside, morning. Lorelai is walking down the street and sees Morey and Babette coming out of the market each of them holding quite a few bags)",
        "LORELAI: Hey, there.",
        "BABETTE: Oh, hi, sugar. Couldn't see you over the bags.",
        "LORELAI: Wow, you got a lot of stuff there. You hunkering down for winter?",
        "BABETTE: Nah, we're getting our supplies for our gallows.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, yeah, you're gonna hang Morey again?",
        "MOREY: Do it every year.",
        "LORELAI: You're always the hit of the neighbourhood.",
        "BABETTE: So, what about you, honey? What are you gonna do?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, you know, the same thing I always do.",
        "BABETTE: (disappointed) Oh. Gonna hang caramel apples from the tree again?",
        "LORELAI: The kids love 'em.",
        "BABETTE: Yeah. They're not that scary.",
        "LORELAI: Well, to a diabetic, they're downright terrifying.",
        "BABETTE: Huh? Okay. Caramel apples.",
        "LORELAI: And I will be handing out candy, which, you know, is the entire point of Halloween.",
        "BABETTE: Sure. Sure, honey. Well, we got a lot to do. We got to go.",
        "MOREY: No rest for the doomed.",
        "BABETTE: See you later. (Babette and Morey start to walk off as Lorelai calls after them)",
        "LORELAI: You know, I-I-I bought a haunted house CD to play in the background. (Babette politely laughs a bit and she and Morey walk away, as Lorelai leaves looking a bit pissed)",
        "(CUT to pool house, evening. Rory and Logan are making out on the couch. Rory breaks the kiss for a bit)",
        "RORY: What time is our reservation?",
        "LOGAN: Now.",
        "RORY: Oh. It's amazing what happens when you can't find your keys.",
        "LOGAN: I think we should order in tonight.",
        "RORY: And the purse is down.",
        "(Rory throws the Birking bag on the floor and the continue smooching. After a bit there is a knock on the door)",
        "RORY: Who is it?",
        "EMILY (OS): Emily Gilmore. (the kids get off the couch and Rory gets the door and lets Emily in)",
        "EMILY: I'm so sorry to bother you, Rory. Hello, Logan.",
        "LOGAN: Hello, Emily.",
        "EMILY: Rory, could you check your closets? The maid hung up your dry cleaning today and I am missing a blouse, and I want to know whether or not to add this to the list of reasons I'm firing her.",
        "RORY: Of course. I'll be right back. (she walks off to the bedroom)",
        "EMILY: Thank you, Rory. I'm so exhausted with incompetent people, I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like every person I hire immediately gets hit in the head with a mallet on their way out of the employment office. (quickly and quietly to Logan) Logan, do you have anything special planned for Rory's birthday next week?",
        "LOGAN: Uh...no, no plans.",
        "EMILY: Oh, good. Because I would love to throw her a party here. A 21st birthday is so special. But I didn't want to order twelve pounds of crab legs if you had plans to whisk her off to Santorini.",
        "LOGAN: No whisking plans in the works.",
        "RORY: (walking back out form the bedroom) Sorry, grandma, your blouse isn't in there.",
        "EMILY: Say, Rory, how would you like a birthday party next week?",
        "RORY: Oh, well...",
        "EMILY: It doesn't have to be a big, formal affair. Just something fun with your friends and a few of the DAR ladies, whoever you want.",
        "RORY: Sure, grandma, a party sounds fine.",
        "EMILY: I'll go right in and call the caterers. 21 years old...time flies, doesn't it? All right, you two, back to what you were doing. (Emily walks out and Rory starts to lead Logan back to the couch)",
        "RORY: Hey, grandma says.",
        "LOGAN: So, a 21st birthday. Big event.",
        "RORY: I guess.",
        "LOGAN: Would've been nice if I had known about it.",
        "RORY: Oh, I didn't tell you?",
        "LOGAN: No.",
        "RORY: Oh. I'm just not into birthdays.",
        "LOGAN: You're not into birthdays? You, who wore green head to toe on St.Patrick's day and bunny ears on Easter?",
        "RORY: I have stock in hallmark.",
        "LOGAN: What's up, Ace?",
        "RORY: We should probably call the restaurant if we still want to try and eat there.",
        "LOGAN: Ace.",
        "RORY: I'm just not excited about this particular birthday.",
        "LOGAN: Why not?",
        "RORY: Because I'm turning 21.",
        "LOGAN: Yes...?",
        "RORY: My mom and I have been planning for my 21st birthday since, well, my first memory is kindergarten, but I have a feeling she was talking about it before then. We had this whole big thing planned.",
        "LOGAN: Yeah...?",
        "RORY: We were gonna go to Atlantic City and sit at a blackjack table at 11:59, and we'd be playing 21 when I turned 21. We were gonna drink martinis and win money and go buy 21 things, and there was this thing including 21 guys that would be totally inappropriate now that I'm with you. But it was a pretty big thing, and...and now we're not talking, so it's not gonna happen. I'm just a little bummed. That's all.",
        "LOGAN: I know you miss your mom. The concept's a little hard for me to grasp, but I know you do. (he sits)",
        "RORY: Well, you never got to know her. She can be pretty cool.",
        "LOGAN: Hey, I know. I'll take you to Atlantic City.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LOGAN: We can still play 21 when you turn 21. We can buy the 21 things. I'd still vote to put the kibosh on that thing with the 21 guys. But other than that, I'm good to go.",
        "RORY: You're sweet, but it's OK. (she sits next to him)",
        "LOGAN: Come on. We'll get a car. 21 cars, if you like.",
        "RORY: No. No, I appreciate the offer a lot, but I'll just have the party and let this birthday pass.",
        "LOGAN: You sure?",
        "RORY: Yeah, yeah, I'm sure. And I'm hungry. You ready to go? (she picks the Birkin bag from the floor and stands up. Logan doesn't follow) Where did I put my keys?",
        "LOGAN: Oh, I think I saw them on the couch.",
        "RORY: Here we go again. (she sits next to him again and they start making out again)",
        "(CUT to Gilmore mansion dinning room, morning. Emily and Rory are sitting at the table, with all sorts of pieces of birthday cake, which Rory's trying, flowers, napkins and invitation cards. The seem to be planning the party)",
        "EMILY: (talks as Rory eats on of the cake samples distracted) You know, when I was turning 21, I somehow got it into my head that I simply had to have my invitations trimmed with real pearls. I could not be convinced that it was at all tacky or impractical. I was right, and that was the way it had to be. My mother was beside herself. I never heard so much sighing in my whole life. But in the end, she found me invitations lined with real pearls, and I felt like the most important girl in the world. So, come on, tell me, which ones are your pearl-trimmed invitations? Rory!",
        "RORY: Hmm?",
        "EMILY: You're supposed to try them all.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "EMILY: The cake. Alfonso made us those samples. The least we can do is try them all.",
        "RORY: Oh, OK, sure. (takes a forkful from another cake)",
        "EMILY: Well, I like the lace. Do you like the lace?",
        "RORY: Sure.",
        "EMILY: All right. The lace it is. Now, the food. I think we should go buffet. Much more youthful. And what do you think of sushi? Sushi feels young, doesn't it?",
        "RORY: I certainly hope so. You don't want any old sushi hanging around.",
        "EMILY: Now, we'll have a bar, heaters on the patio to stem the crowd. Oh, do you want a special tray-passed drink, like a sidecar maybe or a gin fizz? I used to love a nice gin fizz. (noticing Rory isn't paying attention) Am I boring you?",
        "RORY: No, the lace is fine.",
        "EMILY: Rory, where is your head today?",
        "RORY: I don't know. I'm sorry.",
        "EMILY: There are a million other little details I need to go over here. Would you like me to just do it myself?",
        "RORY: Um, sure. You've got great taste. I trust you completely.",
        "EMILY: All right. Then the only thing I need from you is a little guidance on the guest list. Now, I have the information for the DAR ladies, of course, and Logan. I have Logan's information. I believe I have the address of your Asian friend.",
        "RORY: Lane.",
        "EMILY: She hasn't moved?",
        "RORY: Not that I know of.",
        "EMILY: All right",
        "RORY: She'll want to bring her boyfriend.",
        "EMILY: Her boyfriend? How wonderful. Rory's Asian friend...",
        "RORY: Lane!",
        "EMILY: ...has a boyfriend. All right. Now, what about Paris? Are you two friends? I never really can tell.",
        "RORY: Paris should be on the list.",
        "EMILY: Then Paris is on the list.",
        "RORY: She'll want to bring her boyfriend, too.",
        "EMILY: My goodness. I guess there's something in the air. All right. I have the Cheevers, your cousins from Bridgeport. Now, do you want me to put your mother on this list?",
        "RORY: Mom?",
        "EMILY: It's completely up to you. I just thought I should ask.",
        "RORY: Yes, put mom on the list.",
        "EMILY: All right. She's on the list.",
        "RORY: And the chocolate praline crunch is the cake.",
        "EMILY: A chocolate praline crunch cake. (wistful) A chocolate praline crunch cake completely covered with pearls. Ah, to be 21 again.",
        "(CUT to outside Lorelai's house, night. Lorelai drives up and gets out of the car. Morey and Babette are prepping for Halloween)",
        "LORELAI: Wow! Looks great, guys.",
        "BABETTE: Yeah, we made it bigger this year. And we added a great new light effect to help Morey's face look more distorted when he drops because, you know, when you really get hanged, your eyeballs sometimes explode and your tongue splits down the middle. It's disgusting. Wanna see?",
        "LORELAI: Uh...",
        "BABETTE: Morey, shake a leg.",
        "MOREY: Okay. (takes his spot and puts his head in the rope) All set.",
        "BABETTE: Okay! Bombs away! (pulls a lever and Morey falls)",
        "LORELAI: OH!",
        "BABETTE: Now, remember, you got to twitch around a lot, make the kids think you're dying real slow and painful.",
        "MOREY: Okay",
        "BABETTE: Now, obviously there'll be some blood shooting out and some screams, but you get the picture.",
        "LORELAI: I-I-I do.",
        "MOREY: (twitching around a bit, obviously uncomfortable) Babette? Tight, babe.",
        "LORELAI: Do you need help, Babette?",
        "BABETTE: Oh, no. As soon as he passes out, his muscles relax and I can slide him right out. We'll be good.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. See you guys later. (walks off to the house)",
        "(CUT to Lorelai's house inside, continuous. Lorelai comes in and makes her way to the kitchen, where Luke is cooking)",
        "LORELAI: Luke, are you here?",
        "LUKE: In the kitchen.",
        "LORELAI: Where's Paul Anka? He didn't meet me at the door.",
        "LUKE: Peas scare him.",
        "LORELAI: Really? Huh. Peas? (puts down her purse, takes off her coat and looks at a list on the fridge) Cooked or raw?",
        "LUKE: Doesn't seem pleased with either form.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, peas are out. (writes something - peas - on the list) What smells so good?",
        "LUKE: Fried chicken.",
        "LORELAI: Luke, will you marry me?",
        "LUKE: Set the table?",
        "LORELAI: Okay, first, I have some very exciting news to tell you.",
        "LUKE: Shoot! (Lorelai starts to take things out to lay the table)",
        "LORELAI: This year, I have decided do a whole new thing for Halloween.",
        "LUKE: You're not gonna hang the caramel apples again?",
        "LORELAI: Caramel apples aren't scary.",
        "LUKE: Well, what's scary is you opening your house up to a mob of insane, sugar-laced kids wearing masks that conviently hide any identifying features.",
        "LORELAI: I have decided to do something totally different, and I'm gonna need your help.",
        "LUKE: Sure.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. I want to do a skit.",
        "LUKE: Skit?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, I want to be a mad scientist. I'm gonna come out in a blood-stained white lab coat and freaky makeup and big, giant, Don King kind of hairdo, and I'm going to turn the whole front yard into my laboratory.",
        "LUKE: Wow.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, I'm gonna have a huge electric chair and an operating table and test tubes and wires.",
        "LUKE: Sounds elaborate.",
        "LORELAI: But you haven't heard the half of it, okay? And so I come out and I do mad scientist \"banter\", like, \"Hey, who here is from Bellevue?\" and \"'Girl Interrupted'? Now that's my idea of a feel-good movie\". I'll work on it. But anyway, after that, I'm gonna drag you out.",
        "LUKE: What?",
        "LORELAI: You're strapped in an electric chair, and I'm gonna throw the switch and totally electrocute you. And you're flailing around. We'll rig something where smoke and sparks shoot out of your nose. And then once you're dead, I'll throw you onto the operating table and I'll cut you open, and I pull link sausages out of you and throw them into the crowd.",
        "LUKE: That's it?",
        "LORELAI: Well, I mean, we can take a bow or something, but, yeah, that's it.",
        "LUKE: Okay. Uh, just a couple of questions here. Once you've electrocuted me, and I'm dead, um, how exactly do I get to the operating table?",
        "LORELAI: huh. Good question. Maybe I can position the operating table like right near the electric chair so I can just flop you over onto it after you die.",
        "LUKE: Okay, let's say we work that out. Now I'm on the table. You're gonna cut me open with what?",
        "LORELAI: A big, rusty saw.",
        "LUKE: And then you're gonna pull link sausages out of me.",
        "LORELAI: Real slow and creepy like.",
        "LUKE: Okay, great. Last question. Uh, what are the odds of you getting me to do a skit where you electrocute me, cut me open, and pull link sausages out of me? 'Cause I'm thinking they're right up there with Pia Zadora making a big comeback.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, come on. This will be fun.",
        "LUKE: No way, not happening.",
        "LORELAI: But this is our first Halloween together as a full-blown, committed, soon-to-be-married couple. We need to start our own traditions.",
        "LUKE: Tell you what. I'll build you the chair, help with the test tubes, and then I'm done.",

        "RORY: Oh, yeah?",
        "Rev.BOATWRIGHT: Oh, yes. You know, Rory, being a young lady comes with many gifts. Your virtue, for example, is a gift, a precious gift. Possibly the most precious gift you possess.",
        "RORY: (looking the way Emily and Richard went off) Uh-huh.",
        "Rev.BOATWRIGHT: You want to give this gift very carefully. It is a gift you can give to only one man. Once you give it, it's gone. You can't re-gift it. If you give it away too soon to the wrong man, then when the right one does come along, you have no gift to give. You'll have to buy him a sweater. Do you understand what I'm saying?",

        "RORY: Either way.",
        "EMILY: \"Either way\" is not an opinion Rory, just for future reference. (at Claire) Let's have a carving station. Just beef, no turkey.",

        "EMILY: What do you mean?",

        "RORY: No. Why should we make an extra chocolate box? I mean, we're paying for these things. Chocolate boxes do not just grow on trees. They are made. They're made by these hardworking people right here, and it is not right to make these people spend hours making extra chocolate boxes because people are too lazy to make a stupid phone call!

        "EMILY: I see you have a rory.",
        "LORELAI: Excuse me?",
        "EMILY: Your drink. It's called a rory. What's the matter, Luke, you don't like your rory?",
        "LUKE: Oh, no, It's-it's great. It's a little pink, you know.",
        "EMILY: Well, Rory's a girl. Girls like pink.",

        "DOYLE: As you know, I'm a senior, and my reign as editor of the Yale Daily News is officially up at the end of the year and I'm stepping down. I'm going back to writing full-time.",
        "RORY: Wow.",
        "DOYLE: I'm gonna be writing a column in the Daily News called \"The World According to Doyle\".",
        "RORY: I can't imagine The Daily News without you as editor.",

        "PARIS: Me.",
        "RORY: You? (a bit taken aback)",
        "PARIS: That's right. Paris Geller is the new editor of the Yale Daily News. I was worried about the intimidation factor, 'cause people tend to be afraid of me, but I campaigned hard and really worked the \"my parents left me broke\" angle, got a little sympathy vote, and the next thing I know, I am the man.",
        "DOYLE: My woman is the man. (Rory looks around a bit uncomfortable)",

        "PARIS: Yeah. Last year I was sleeping with the editor.",
        "DOYLE: And this year, I am.",
        "RORY: (still a bit uncomfortable) Um...I have to go say hello to some people, so I'll catch up with you guys later. Have some food. There's tons of food.",

        "LUKE: What's this?",
        "LORELAI: You know they shouldn't be allowed to put just anything into a martini glass. Martinis should go into a martini glass. Gin martinis, vodka martinis, period. That's it.",
        "LUKE: Do you know what this is?",
        "LORELAI: It's raw fish, Luke. Dip it in soy sauce and swallow it real quick. We were gonna drink martinis. The Rat Pack drank martinis. James Bond drank martinis. You know, it's the sweet drinks that really kill you. It's the sugar that give you the hangover and makes you throw up.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, 'cause no one's ever thrown up from a martini before. (puts the sushi in his mouth)",
        "LORELAI: You seen my father?",

        "VIVIAN: We just wanted to tell you we love Rory.",
        "CATHERINE: She introduced us to buffalo wings and jalapeno poppers, and for that we will be eternally grateful.",
        "LUKE: What's the DAR? (the ladies laugh again, Luke looks at Lorelai quizzically, and she smiles) I'm gonna get a beer. Anyone want anything?",

        "LUKE: Oh, the magic words. I was just heading over to the bar.",

        "LUKE: Yes, I have. Not my kind of drink.",
        "RORY: Yeah, mine, either.",

        "LUKE: Oh, uh, here. I've got something for you. (looks in his pockets, takes out a jewellery gift box and hands it over to her) Birthday present.",
        "RORY: Really?",
        "LUKE: Yeah, I brought it just in case your mother didn't bring one, but she did. It's the one on top of your present mountain over there. But since I already had it in my pocket, I just figured...(Rory opens it and looks at it touched)",
        "RORY: Luke.",
        "LUKE: It was my mother's. Liz can't wear it 'cause her neck's too fat, but your neck looks, you know, not fat. It was sitting around in my drawer, so I thought, \"hey, give it to Rory\". You know you're lucky 'cause Caesar's birthday is next month and I know he likes pearls, so...",

        "LORELAI: Seems to be a big hit.",
        "EMILY: Where's Luke? I hope he didn't get lost somewhere.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, no, I'm sure he's just sizing up how much silver he can stuff into his pockets without it making too much of a bulge.",
        "EMILY: I was not insinuating that he was a thief.",
        "LORELAI: Ah.",
        "EMILY: I was just making small, polite talk. That's what you do at parties. My commenting on his getting lost was in no way a swipe.",
        "LORELAI: I'm sorry, I forgot. Luke went to get a beer. Take it. (Emily notices Lorelai's ring) Come on, Mom, it's all about timing. You know that. What are you...(realises what Emily is looking at)",
        "EMILY: well, it seems congratulations are in order.",
        "LORELAI: Well, that wasn't exactly congratulations, but, sure, close enough. (Claire comes to Emily)",

        "CLAIRE: No, I haven't.",
        "EMILY: Of course not. He's going to sit all night long in that office of his, moping and sulking, missing his granddaughter's birthday party, and he's going to leave me out here all alone to host it. Fine. Come on, Claire. (Emily and Claire walk off, and Lorelai looks with concern towards the house and starts to make her way inside)",
        "(CUT to Richard's study. There is a knock on the door and Lorelai enters. Richard is sitting in one of the armchairs drinking scotch and sulking)",
        "LORELAI: Hello? Dad? You're missing a crazy party out there. You know someone forgot to cook the fish? Boy, is Mom gonna be mad.",
        "RICHARD: Go away, Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: What's wrong, Dad?",
        "RICHARD: You know what's wrong. Rory's wrong. It's all wrong. She's not going back to Yale. It's my fault. (Lorelai sits opposite him)",
        "LORELAI: Rory made a choice, Dad.",
        "RICHARD: I could've stopped her, and I didn't. I cleared the path for her to walk away from her goal, her life.",
        "LORELAI: Dad...",
        "RICHARD: She's having s*x, Lorelai. She's having s*x under my roof. I paid 40,000 dollars to redecorate her s*x house. I bought her her s*x mattress, her s*x box springs. I provided everything she needs to waste her life.",
        "LORELAI: Dad, Rory having s*x is not your fault, really. She was having s*x way before the big renovation.",
        "RICHARD: I feel so much better now.",
        "LORELAI: I'm sorry. I-I wasn't trying to...",
        "RICHARD: I made a terrible, terrible mistake.",
        "LORELAI: No, Dad, listen...(Emily walks in rather upset)",
        "EMILY: Richard, you come out of here right now and make an appearance at this party.",
        "RICHARD: I don't give a damn about the party, Emily.",
        "EMILY: What is going on with you? You've been holed up in here for two days. Is it work?",
        "LORELAI: It's Rory.",
        "EMILY: What about Rory?",
        "RICHARD: What do you mean, \"What about Rory\"? We've lost her.",
        "EMILY: What are you talking about? I got her out of the pool house.",
        "RICHARD: For a day. For two days, and then those rentals go back.",
        "EMILY: Fine, then I'll have the place fumigated. That'll take a week. Then I'll have the place checked for mold. That'll be two weeks. Then I'll find rats. Then there will be carbon monoxide leaks, and pluming issues and if I have to, I'll tear the damn place down. In the meantime, she's here where we can watch her.",
        "RICHARD: That doesn't matter, Emily. We have lost her.",
        "EMILY: No!",
        "RICHARD: We've failed.",
        "EMILY: No! We have not failed. We have not failed until that girl comes home pregnant. Then we've failed!",
        "LORELAI: And on that note...(Lorelai gets up and walks out of the study)",
        "EMILY: Richard, I don't understand what's happening. Everything's been fine except the s*x issue.",
        "RICHARD: Everything hasn't been fine. (frustrated gets up and starts pacing) The minute we went against Lorelai, we lost.",
        "EMILY: You're acting like this is my fault. Going against Lorelai was your idea. I was perfectly ready to go ahead with the plan that the three of us devised.",
        "RICHARD: Running around with Logan, joining the DAR, planning parties.",
        "EMILY: What's wrong with joining the DAR? We both agreed she needed a job.",
        "RICHARD: Fund-raisers and tea parties? It's frivolous and meaningless. She has more to do, more to be. I don't want that life for her.",
        "EMILY: (with an upset and a insulted look) You mean my life. You don't want her to be me.",
        "RICHARD: Emily, no. That's not what I meant.",
        "EMILY: We're cutting the cake now. Can't wait anymore. (Emily walks out clearly upset, and Richard is left alone also upset)",

        "RORY: So.",
        "LORELAI: Your drink is disgusting.",

        "LORELAI: Yeah.",
        "RORY: Wow. That's nice.",
        "So, what's new with you?",
        "RORY: Oh, well, not much. I got my community service hours down from 300 to 104, so...",
        "LORELAI: God, community should be well-served by now. They should build a statue of you when you're done.",
        "RORY: Well, it's not just one community.",
        "LORELAI: Right, yeah. That makes more sense, I guess. I got a dog.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: Stop. He's fine.",
        "RORY: He's alive?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, he's alive, and I'm not discussing that hamster again.",
        "RORY: But you asked Babette to double-check that you feed it in the morning?",
        "LORELAI: That is so not necessary...and yes.",
        "RORY: Wow, a dog. A lot has changed.",
        "LORELAI: A lot, and then not so much, also.",
        "RORY: Did you get your chocolate box? They're by the door.",
        "LORELAI: No, I didn't. I'll get one on the way out.",
