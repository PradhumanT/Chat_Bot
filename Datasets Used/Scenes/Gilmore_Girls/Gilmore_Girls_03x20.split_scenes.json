        "[Kyle and Marshall are cleaning up litter in the front yard.]",
        "KYLE: Get the wrapper.",
        "MARSHALL: What wrapper?",
        "KYLE: The Tootsie Roll wrapper.",
        "MARSHALL: What Tootsie Roll wrapper?",
        "KYLE: The one at your feet.",
        "MARSHALL: I don't see it.",
        "KYLE: It's right there.",
        "MARSHALL: Where?",
        "KYLE: Marshall, stop arguing with me, my parents are watching.",
        "[Lorelai is waiting on the sidewalk; Rory walks out of the house with a backpack]",
        "LORELAI: Have you see these guys? They're hilarious.",
        "RORY: I got it, we can go.",
        "LORELAI: Why are you holding it like that?",
        "RORY: Because when Lane left it here last night, it was a very different color.",
        "LORELAI: Are you sure she's gonna want that back? It's been left alone all night at a keg party. There's no getting it over that. That backpack is permanently scarred. That backpack is Zelda Fitzgerald.",
        "RORY: Well, Zelda's going home.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. Your first cop-raided party. I am just so proud.",
        "RORY: Mom.",
        "LORELAI: I just wish I could've been there.",
        "RORY: It was no big deal.",
        "LORELAI: Did they bring the paddywagon?",
        "RORY: Yeah, but then we snuck out the backdoor of the speak-easy and headed straight for the Algonquin.",
        "LORELAI: How was Benchley?",
        "RORY: Drunk again.",
        "LORELAI: So tell me more about this party last night. I mean, I know the end, but what happened in the middle?",
        "RORY: Lane's band played, they were great, and then people just hung out and talked, and then, uh, there was some sort of fight, I guess. The cops came, that's it.",
        "LORELAI: Hm.",
        "[Luke walks up to the house]",
        "LORELAI: Hey, Luke.",
        "LUKE: I'm in bed. I have ten more minutes to sleep. Not a lot of time in the grand scheme of things, but still, ten minutes is ten minutes. You know what I mean.",
        "LORELAI: Sure, yeah.",
        "RORY: Ten minutes is great.",
        "LUKE: And then the phone rings, and it just rings and rings and rings and rings, so I pick it up.",
        "LORELAI: And then hopefully got your hearing checked.",
        "LUKE: Can I finish my story?",
        "LORELAI: I'm just saying, that's a lot of rings.",
        "LUKE: And on the other end of the phone is someone named John who says he's Kyle's father, and Kyle threw a party last night without permission. And two guys got into a fight and tore the place apart, so John wants me to come down and take a look at the damage and discuss some sort of solution to the problem of the damages. Now, I don't know John, and I certainly don't know Kyle, but I do know someone who would get into a fight at a party and leave the place completely trashed. It's a wild guess, but I think his name rhymes with Tess. So here I am, heading in there to talk to John about Kyle and discuss what is to be done about the Hummel.",
        "LORELAI: The what?",
        "LUKE: Exactly.",
        "[Luke walks toward the front door]",
        "LORELAI: Uh, so let's get back to the party recap. Any little details you wanna tell Mommy?",
        "RORY: Jess and Dean got into the fight.",
        "LORELAI: Over you.",
        "RORY: I was a contributing factor.",
        "LORELAI: Was anyone hurt?",
        "RORY: No.",
        "LORELAI: And that's why the cops came and broke up the party?",
        "RORY: Yes.",
        "LORELAI: So not only did you go to a cop-raided party but you started the raid?",
        "RORY: Yes.",
        "LORELAI: This fence is broken because of you, this crap is on the ground because of you.",
        "RORY: What's your point?",
        "LORELAI: [sings] Did you ever know that you're my hero?",
        "RORY: Oh my God!",
        "LORELAI: [sings] You're everything I would like to be. And I could fly higher than an eagle, 'cause you are the wind beneath my wings.",
        "[opening credits]",
        "CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN",
        "[Guests are gathered in the lobby for breakfast. Two of them walk up to Lorelai.]",
        "DENNIS: Oh, these muffins, they're brilliant.",
        "PEG: Tell us you sell your muffin mix.",
        "LORELAI: Sookie, these people wanna throw roses at your feet.",
        "SOOKIE: And I will let them.",
        "PEG: Listen, Sookie, Dennis and I and a bunch of us others wondered if you offered cooking classes.",
        "SOOKIE: Cooking classes?",
        "DENNIS: Some of the better B&B's have them on the itinerary.",
        "SOOKIE: Oh, of course they do. So, we do, too.",
        "PEG: We will be your disciples.",
        "SOOKIE: Oh my gosh, we're gonna have so much fun. We'll start with some spreads and jams, and if there's time - desserts. I have this chocolate balm. . .oh, but breads. . .and soups!",
        "LORELAI: Um, Sookie, hon, we don't have a kitchen.",
        "SOOKIE: Oh, right.",
        "PEG: There's no kitchen?",
        "SOOKIE: Okay, not a problem. You'll all come to my house.",
        "PEG: Can't wait.",
        "DENNIS: Cheers.",
        "[Lorelai and Sookie walk to the front desk]",
        "LORELAI: Uh, make a note - if the guests are gonna wear those robes downstairs, we need to buy ones with thicker material.",
        "SOOKIE: Really.",
        "LORELAI: Seeing the sunlight hit Dennis gave me a whole new respect for Peg.",
        "SOOKIE: Hey, listen, uh, Jackson's up in Rochester today helping his cousin rebuild his Nova. He's not getting home 'til late, so you know what that makes me?",
        "LORELAI: Available.",
        "SOOKIE: Like an intern.",
        "LORELAI: Oh.",
        "SOOKIE: What are you and Rory doing tonight?",
        "LORELAI: I'm open. Rory's got plans with the grandparents.",
        "SOOKIE: I didn't know you guys were back in touch.",
        "LORELAI: I'm not, Rory is.",
        "SOOKIE: Ah.",
        "LORELAI: Mmhmm, yeah.",
        "SOOKIE: Well, at least the family pressure's off you now. That's good, right?",
        "LORELAI: I don't know. I mean, before this whole Friday night dinner thing, I didn't see them regularly and we didn't talk regularly, so it wasn't weird when I didn't see them or talk to them regularly.",
        "SOOKIE: You miss them.",
        "LORELAI: No, I just feel like I'm not doing something I'm supposed to do. I feel guilty.",
        "SOOKIE: So what are you gonna do about it?",
        "LORELAI: I'm gonna hope it passes.",
        "SOOKIE: Sounds healthy.",
        "CUT TO CHURCH",
        "[The priest is leading a service at the front of the room. Rory walks in with Lane's backpack and takes it to Lane, who is sitting at a table at the back of the church]",
        "PRIEST: Blessed are they who mourn, for they will be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are they. . .",
        "RORY: Hey.",
        "LANE: Hi.",
        "RORY: So, how are you? How were things last night?",
        "LANE: You mean, after my drunken call to my mother?",
        "RORY: Yeah. What happened when you got home?",
        "LANE: I'm not sure.",
        "RORY: What do you mean you're not sure?",
        "LANE: Well, after I finished with my Farelly brothers' audition in the bushes - thank you for the hair-holding, by the way.",
        "RORY: Anytime.",
        "LANE: Dave dropped me off at home. He wanted to come in, but he's an only child and I saw no reason for his family line to end with him, so I went in and he left.",
        "RORY: And?",
        "LANE: The place was dark.",
        "RORY: No Mrs. Kim?",
        "LANE: No Mrs. Kim.",
        "RORY: No Mrs. Kim.",
        "LANE: So, of course, I panicked. What does this mean? I mean, when I come home ten minutes late from bible study, she has a cow. But I call her drunk, tell her I'm at a party, I'm a drummer in a band, and I'm in love with a non-Korean. . .I expected there to be backup - aunts, uncles, cousins pulled out from villages I've never heard of, but nothing.",
        "RORY: I don't understand.",
        "LANE: So I go upstairs to make sure everything's okay. I look in her room and she's in bed asleep.",
        "RORY: No.",
        "LANE: Then this morning, I get up, I go in the kitchen where she's making breakfast and I say, \"Good morning, Mama.\"",
        "RORY: And?",
        "LANE: She turns around, looks right at me and says, \"Good morning, Lane.\"",
        "RORY: Really?",
        "LANE: And those were the last words she's said to me all day.",
        "RORY: So she's freezing you out?",
        "LANE: No, it was more Stepford than cold. You know, very calm, very serene.",
        "RORY: Okay, well, let's think. Maybe she didn't hear you.",
        "LANE: I was drunk, I could've slurred.",
        "RORY: Exactly. Maybe she thought you said you were at a smarty, playing clock music, drinking fear, and in love with Rave Smitchalsky.",
        "LANE: And how would that be better?",
        "RORY: It's much less clear.",
        "LANE: What is that smell?",
        "RORY: Your backpack.",
        "PRIEST: Blessed are they which are pers -",
        "[The priest sees the rabbi at the back of the church gesturing for him to speed things up.]",
        "PRIEST: [speaks quickly] Uh, blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs are the Kingdom of Heaven.",
        "RORY: You have to talk to her, Lane.",
        "LANE: I can't talk to her.",
        "RORY: Well, what are you going to do?",
        "LANE: Well, first off, I volunteered to work this table for the next two months. Plus, I told her I'd go to that Seventh Day Adventist college in Hartford and live at home.",
        "RORY: Lane, no.",
        "LANE: And I told Dave to forget about the prom. There's no way that's gonna happen.",
        "RORY: I'm sorry.",
        "LANE: Don't be, it's my fault.",
        "[The rabbi enters with a group of people]",
        "PRIEST: And utter every kind of evil against you falsely because of me, Amen. Okay, let's go. Sorry, David.",
        "RABBI: No problem, Archie.",
        "[The priest leaves, the rabbi starts his service.]",
        "CUT TO LUKE'S DINER",
        "[Jess rushes around the crowded diner serving people]",
        "WOMAN: Excuse me, I'd like some ham.",
        "JESS: Be right back.",
        "WOMAN: But I'd like some ham!",
        "[Jess delivers a plate to a table]",
        "MAN 1: Is this what I ordered?",
        "JESS: Yes. [walks to the table by the door] Know what you want yet?",
        "MAN 2: Oh, uh, no, not yet.",
        "JESS: You know what might help?",
        "MAN 2: What?",
        "JESS: Opening the menu.",
        "MAN 2: Yes, thank you for the tip.",
        "[Jess walks to the counter]",
        "JESS: I need ham.",
        "CAESAR: No ham.",
        "JESS: We got a shipment of ham yesterday.",
        "CAESAR: No ham.",
        "JESS: Caesar, there's a lady over there that has been saying she wants ham for the last twenty minutes and if I go back there empty handed, there's a fifty-fifty chance that she will eat me.",
        "CAESAR: No ham.",
        "JESS: Then sew some bacon together 'cause that woman is getting ham.",
        "[Jess picks up a plate and walks toward the tables]",
        "MAN 1: Excuse me, I don't think this is what I. . .[Jess exchanges his plate with the one he's carrying] Thank you.",
        "JESS: [holds up the plate] Who ordered this? Look in front of you. If there is nothing there and there should be, then this is yours.",
        "KIRK: Oh, here.",
        "[Jess gives Kirk the plate, then walks back over to the man at the table by the door]",
        "JESS: Well?",
        "MAN 2: What?",
        "JESS: You know what you want yet?",
        "MAN 2: I'll just have more coffee.",
        "JESS: More coffee coming up. Glad to make your dining dreams come true.",
        "[Taylor walks in]",
        "TAYLOR: [sings] \"Oh, who can take a sunrise, sprinkle it with dew. Cover it in chocolate and a miracle or two, the candy man. Oh, the candy man can!\" Yes, that's right, the candy man can 'cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good, and I, ladies and gentlemen, am the candy man. Your candy man. I'm mixing it with love and making Stars Hollow taste good.",
        "JESS: Move.",
        "TAYLOR: Uh, in a second Jess. Give him a taffy. I come to announce to one and all that the day we all thought would never get here has arrived.",
        "KIRK: Arbor Day?",
        "TAYLOR: No.",
        "KIRK: The Day of Reckoning?",
        "TAYLOR: No",
        "KIRK: The day the music died?",
        "TAYLOR: Kirk.",
        "KIRK: Give me a taffy.",
        "TAYLOR: What?",
        "KIRK: I've got a million of 'em. Give me a taffy!",
        "TAYLOR: As I was saying, the big day has arrived. The opening of Taylor's Old Fashioned Soda Shoppe and Candy Store! Tomorrow from noon to six, there will be fun, balloons, ice cream, and old fashioned penny candy for just one dollar a piece. Come at noon, stay all day. . .",
        "[Luke walks in]",
        "JESS: Where the hell have you been? The place is a freaking zoo. Every table's full and I've got Sammy Davis Jr. here thinking it's the Desert Inn.",
        "LUKE: I had to run an errand.",
        "JESS: Everybody's complaining, we're out of ham, Caesar's suddenly decided to join the Slow Food Movement, and I've got a guy who's moved in at a table for four. He just sits, making it impossible for me to turn over that table, and if I can't turn over that table, then that cuts way back on my tips.",
        "LUKE: I'm sorry, don't you mean my tips?",
        "JESS: What?",
        "LUKE: You know where I was this morning?",
        "JESS: No.",
        "LUKE: I was at Kyle's. His parents called me this morning.",
        "JESS: Oh, yeah?",
        "LUKE: Seems a little party you went to last night got a little Animal House, huh?",
        "JESS: Dean started it.",
        "LUKE: Oh, you're not really gonna use that one, are you?",
        "JESS: Well, he did. He sucker punched me and I was just defending myself.",
        "LUKE: Oh, apparently you defended yourself all the way through the house and out into the front yard. You defended yourself with a chair that is now broken. You defended yourself with a coffee table. You defended yourself with an ottoman.",
        "JESS: I don't need a recap.",
        "LUKE: Do you have any idea how much damage you caused?",
        "JESS: Dean caused it, too.",
        "LUKE: The place was trashed.",
        "JESS: Dean trashed it, too.",
        "LUKE: Are you trying to kill me?",
        "JESS: Nope, it'll just be a perk.",
        "LUKE: Okay, well, here's the deal. From now on, every cent that you make here goes toward paying them back.",
        "JESS: Hey, what about -",
        "LUKE: Dean's paying them back also.",
        "JESS: How do you know?",
        "LUKE: Because he was at Kyle's house when I got there.",
        "JESS: You're kidding me.",
        "LUKE: He had already worked out a financial agreement with the parents and was helping them put a fence back up.",
        "JESS: Man, he's gonna make some woman a fine doormat someday.",
        "LUKE: You are making good on this, Jess.",
        "JESS: I have to get more coffee out of the store room.",
        "LUKE: Every cent is getting paid back. I never want those people calling me again.",
        "[The man at the table by the door gets up and leaves. Luke notices that the man left his wallet on the table. Luke picks it up, then walks out the door to catch him]",
        "LUKE: Hey, you left your wallet! Hey!",
        "[Luke opens the wallet and checks the ID]",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "[Lorelai walks down the steps carrying some skirts. Rory is in the living room getting ready to leave]",
        "LORELAI: Okay, here's the problem. Every single one of my skirts is either too long or too short for this season's acceptable lengths. Which means I either have to alter or shop.",
        "RORY: To be or not to be.",
        "LORELAI: Just wait 'til you hear what InStyle thinks of you, young lady. What time are you getting home tonight?",
        "RORY: We have to go over the special graduation edition of the Franklin, and of course we're completely behind, partly because Paris can't let anything go to print unless she's proofed it a million times. Can you say crazy a**l micromanager?",
        "LORELAI: Not five times fast.",
        "RORY: I'll be home by ten.",
        "LORELAI: That's all I needed to know.",
        "RORY: I forgot my notes.",
        "LORELAI: I put them in your bedroom.",
        "[Rory walks to her bedroom. Lorelai picks up the phone and dials a number]",
        "EMILY: Hello?",
        "LORELAI: Hi, Mom.",
        "EMILY: Lorelai?",
        "LORELAI: Yup, it's me. So, how are you?",
        "EMILY: I'm fine.",
        "LORELAI: Good. How's Dad?",
        "EMILY: He's fine.",
        "LORELAI: Also good.",
        "EMILY: May I speak with Rory please?",
        "LORELAI: No, you can't speak with Rory.",
        "EMILY: Why not?",
        "LORELAI: Because I called you.",
        "EMILY: So what?",
        "LORELAI: You don't get to request a switch when a person calls you.",
        "EMILY: I'm sure she's standing right there.",
        "LORELAI: Not the point. If you wanna talk to Rory, you have to call. Then when I answer the phone, you can ask for Rory. But you didn't call, I called, so you cannot ask for Rory.",
        "EMILY: What do you want, Lorelai?",
        "LORELAI: I just wanted to see how you were. I haven't seen you for awhile.",
        "EMILY: Your choice.",
        "LORELAI: No, your choice, Mom.",
        "EMILY: You're the one who called off Friday night dinners.",
        "LORELAI: No, I'm the one who called off the obligation for Friday night dinners. You're the one who called off. . .ugh, you know what, I didn't call to argue.",
        "EMILY: Fine, let's not argue.",
        "LORELAI: Come on, Mom, this is silly. I mean, think back to before the whole Friday night dinner thing. We still had a relationship.",
        "EMILY: You mean the one where I would trick you into calling me by leaving a message on your answering machine saying I had something important to tell you, but I wouldn't include the details so you had no choice but to call me.",
        "LORELAI: Yes.",
        "EMILY: And then when you did call, we'd talk about the weather, you'd ask about the DAR, and then you'd put Rory on the phone, even when she was too young to talk.",
        "LORELAI: It was not always like that.",
        "EMILY: It was always like that. Very well. The weather's fine, the DAR is staging a luncheon at the library next week. You already said I couldn't talk to Rory, so there, I think you've fulfilled your obligation.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, Mom, fine. Have a nice day.",
        "EMILY: Same to you.",
        "[They hang up. Lorelai's phone rings]",
        "LORELAI: It's for you!",
        "CUT TO CHILTON",
        "[Rory rushes into the Franklin meeting]",
        "RORY: Sorry, sorry, sorry.",
        "PARIS: The issue is a disaster. It's our last issue of the Franklin and it's a complete disaster.",
        "RORY: I'm sure it's not that bad.",
        "PARIS: And that's why you won't need to Botox your frown lines on your nineteenth birthday. [to another student] Not that picture, no, put it down. Put it down now! [walks away]",
        "[Rory walks over to Madeline and Louise]",
        "RORY: How's it coming?",
        "LOUISE: Very frustrating.",
        "MADELINE: We just can't seem to get exactly the right combination.",
        "LOUISE: All right. How about blue dress, blonde guy, black limo? Works best for me.",
        "MADELINE: Yes, however, green dress, red-haired guy, white limo works best for me.",
        "LOUISE: White limo with blonde guy totally doesn't work. It's too washed up.",
        "RORY: I'm assuming this conversation veered off of the cover page placement?",
        "MADELINE: How about black-haired guy, green dress and tan limo?",
        "LOUISE: Tan limo?",
        "MADELINE: Good neutral backdrop.",
        "LOUISE: Well, this opens up a whole new set of options. Bring the golf team back in.",
        "RORY: Okay, why don't I just get these pesky Franklin articles out of your way. There we go.",
        "PARIS: What are you doing?",
        "RORY: I am working on the front page placement.",
        "PARIS: What are they doing?",
        "RORY: Staying true to who they are.",
        "LOUISE: Look, prom is once. It happens, it's photographed, and then it's there forever.",
        "MADELINE: Planning is essential.",
        "LOUISE: By the way, Paris, we left a space for you in the limo. However, we're gonna need the color of your dress.",
        "MADELINE: And a picture of Jamie.",

I never watch more than 30 minutes of television a night partly because I think it's a waste of time and partly because there's nothing on. I respect my parents, I do well in school, I never play video games in case they do someday prove that playing them can turn you into a serial killer. I don't drink coffee. I hate soda because the carbonation freaks me out. I'm happy to give up meat if you feel strongly about it. I don't mind wearing a tie.
