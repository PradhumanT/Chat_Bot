        "[Lorelai and Sookie stand near a woman holding two docile horses.]",
        "LORELAI: Oh, I love them. [petting the horses' noses]",
        "SOOKIE: Ooh, I love them, too. [also petting their noses]",
        "LORELAI: With an unbridled passion. Good one, huh?",
        "SOOKIE: I love horse humor. [giggles]",
        "WOMAN: These guys are the best I've got 'cause they're so sweet.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, Michel, come on over. Meet our two new employees.",
        "MICHEL: [standing far away] You know that I do not care for the animal kingdom.",
        "WOMAN: Do you want me to hold them for you? 'Cause I've got a couple of others interested.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, yes, definitely hold them. [dials number on cell phone]",
        "RORY'S VOICEMAIL MESSAGE: It's Rory, Talk please [beep]",
        "LORELAI: Hi, Rory, it's me. How's school? You learning stuff? Listen, we have the horses, Desdemona and Cletus, and the first two rides have to be me and you. And hopefully, you're over the time that I took you for the pony ride, and the pony was old and just sort of stopped and laid down, and you sort of rolled off into the ditch. It's really not likely to happen again. I promise. So, call me, call me. [puts phone away as Tom walks by] Hey, Tom, how do you like our new horses?",
        "TOM: Very fragrant. Follow me.",
        "LORELAI: [to horse] He's very busy. Don't judge him too harshly.",

        "[Tom enters and catches workers standing idle.]",
        "TOM: Hey, guys, how's National Goof-off day going? That's what I thought. [Lorelai, Sookie and Michel join Tom] Now, we got downstairs hardware being delivered on Wednesday morning.",
        "SOOKIE: Yippee. [clapping hands with glee]",
        "TOM: Yeah, it excites me too. So, I think it would be exciting to have one of you here to see that it's the right stuff. Otherwise, things would come to a crashing halt.",
        "LORELAI: Oh boy, I got back to back meetings on Wednesday, and one of them is in Hartford. Sook?",
        "SOOKIE: I can be here. Oh no, I can't - Davey has a check up that morning.",
        "LORELAI: Can you move it?",
        "SOOKIE: This doctor's really booked. But I can try.",
        "LORELAI: That's okay. Michel?",
        "MICHEL: I'm at the Tally Rand making the money that keeps me from having to stand at expressway off-ramps selling bags of cherries.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. Oh well, I guess I can move some things around. I don't...",
        "[A phone rings in the background.]",
        "LORELAI: What is that?",
        "TOM: That's your phone.",
        "SOOKIE: Who's phone? Our phone?",
        "TOM: I installed it this morning. You wanted your phone up and running, right? To take reservations?",
        "SOOKIE: Oh, my God. [clapping hands]",
        "LORELAI: Our first reservation.",
        "MICHEL: Quick, quick, answer before they hang up.",
        "LORELAI: Hello?",
        "SOOKIE: Dragonfly, Dragonfly.",
        "MICHEL: Say Dragonfly Inn.",
        "LORELAI: I mean, Dragonfly Iinn, hello. [pause] Why, yes! We are taking reservations. Our opening day is May 6th. [pause] May 8th and 9th, okay, great. Let me just check. Let me check. [pause] Okay. [She searches for a scrap of paper to write the information on. Unable to find anything else, she uses a gum wrapper.] You got it, and you're getting our best room. Let me just get your information here. Yes. Okay. And your number? Mm-hmm. 7873. Okay. Got your name. Got your number. Got you down for the 8th and 9th. Thank you, Mr. Turner. See you then. [hangs up] We're up and running.",
        "SOOKIE: We're up and running!",
        "MICHEL: But you wrote it down on a gum wrapper.",
        "LORELAI: So?",
        "MICHEL: It's embarrassing. This is an historical document.",
        "SOOKIE: Who cares what she wrote it down on?",
        "[Lorelai smiles thoughtfully, looking at the gum wrapper.]",
        "MICHEL: Big Red wrapper.",
        "SOOKIE: Juicyfruit would have been better?",
        "MICHEL: Well, I'm going to go out and get a value pack for when things really start getting busy around here.",

        "[Rory is leaving a message on Lorelai's voicemail.]",
        "RORY: Mom, it's me, I left you a message at home, too. I love that you got horses. As far as that pony ride when I was a kid, you were forgetting one little tidbit there. That pony did not lie down. He died, okay? He died. And then the owner dragged him away by the back legs. Every time I use glue, I think of him. But I'll watch you ride, how's that? Call me back, bye. [She stops before her dorm door and pulls out keys. Just then, Lane exits the room.]",
        "LANE: What are you doing here?",
        "RORY: I live here.",
        "LANE: But you have game theory class in fifteen minutes.",
        "RORY: I just thought I would lie down and rest for a while.",
        "LANE: I knew it. You were up too late last night. I know I should have told you \"lights out.\"",
        "RORY: I had to finish my paper.",
        "LANE: Your brain needs sleep.",
        "RORY: It can sleep when I finish my paper.",
        "LANE: And then there'll be another paper.",
        "RORY: Mom -",
        "LANE: You know what I mean.",
        "RORY: You look out for me.",
        "LANE: It's what I do. Okay, go lay down.",
        "RORY: Yes, ma'am.",
        "LANE: And stay off drugs. [Rory enters dorm room]",
        "RORY: Whoa, what's that smell?",
        "TANNA: It's the smoke from my soldering iron. I love it. I love burning things. I love the hot tip of my soldering iron as it liquefies metal and singes the wires -",
        "RORY: Honey, how long you been doing that?",
        "TANNA: [checks her watch] Three hours.",
        "RORY: [She removes the iron from Tanna's hand.] Take a break.",
        "[Paris enters]",
        "PARIS: Oh, good, you're all here, so we can clear this up. I found this lying around, and it must belong to one of you because who else would have clothing here? I ask you. [She holds up a shirt with the name Kleebold across the back.] Anyone? Anyone?",
        "JANET: Paris.",
        "PARIS: Anyone? You know, maybe I misspoke. It may not be a shirt. Anyone lose a car cover? Anyone? Anyone?",
        "JANET: Knock it off.",
        "PARIS: I'm just trying to find a nice way to tell you that your behemoth boyfriend is getting a little too comfortable around here. And I speak for everyone.",
        "RORY: Leave me out of this.",
        "TANNA: Me too, please.",
        "PARIS: I just don't want to walk into our bathroom and find him sitting on the john shooting up steroids.",
        "JANET: He does not take steroids.",
        "PARIS: You mean that unsightly girth is nature given? He must curse God nightly.",
        "JANET: Enough!",
        "PARIS: And the shirt -- stick a pole in it, and Cirque Du Soleil could start selling tickets.",
        "RORY: He's big, Paris. She got it.",
        "PARIS: And why does he have his name written on the back? So it's easy to check when he forgets it? Although if he checks it while he's wearing it, he'd have to look in a mirror, and then he'd probably think his name was Dlobeelk, and get confused all over again.",
        "JANET: Bitter little woman.",
        "PARIS: If he's gonna continue being an unwelcome guest in our place, I emphasize the word \"our,\" keep him penned in your room.",
        "JANET: Jealousy doesn't become you, Paris.",
        "PARIS: What jealousy?",
        "RORY: Break it up, guys.",
        "JANET: Neither does makeup or a hairstyle.",
        "PARIS: Can it, Blondie.",
        "JANET: You drove your own boyfriend away, so you hate that anyone else has one.",
        "PARIS: Oh please.",
        "JANET: Yeah, why don't you go sit all alone in your room so you can start getting used to how the rest of your life's gonna be.",
        "PARIS: I'm not alone.",
        "JANET: Oh, really? Who do you have besides your poster of Noam Chomsky?",
        "PARIS: Who do I have?",
        "JANET: Yeah. [Paris begins to speak but falls silent.] That's what I thought. Very sad.",
        "[Janet exits to her bedroom. Paris stomps off to her own bedroom, followed by Rory.]",
        "PARIS: I'm gonna grab Barbie's neck and squeeze until her expandable hair falls out and she's dead, dead, dead.",
        "RORY: Are you staying in here, because I was gonna close my eyes for a little while. [sits down on bed]",
        "PARIS: I should just tell her Asher Fleming's my man so she can compare her circa 1972 Lou Ferrigno with him.",
        "RORY: Then tell her. Put this to rest.",
        "PARIS: You know we're keeping it on the down low. It's easier this way. You're the only person that knows.",
        "RORY: Then you're gonna have to swallow stuff like that and not let it get to you.",
        "PARIS: He smells. That fat tub of hers smells.",
        "RORY: Hey, did you keep your notes from when you took Major English Poets?",
        "PARIS: I've got them somewhere.",
        "RORY: Can I borrow them?",
        "PARIS: Sure.",
        "RORY: Great, 'cause that means I can skip a class this week. [lays down] Buys me two hours.",
        "PARIS: I taught Asher that phrase, \"on the down low.\" He called it delightful.",
        "RORY: It's a delightful phrase. [settles deeper under bed covers]",
        "PARIS: You know, maybe it's not Janet's boyfriend I can't be around. Maybe I just can't be around boys, because I have a man.",
        "RORY: Yes, that's it. Resting now.",
        "CUT TO LORELAI AND RORY'S LIVING ROOM",
        "[The phone ringing rolls over to the answering machine.]",

        "RORY: [voice on phone speaker] Hello? Pick up, pick up, pick up.",
        "LORELI: [from upstairs] Wait, I'm here. Wait.",
        "RORY: I'm running as we speak to not be late for my first official day as a full-fledged food-hall card swiper. That's right, I'm no longer a trainee. After one and a half hours of rigorous training, I am fully independent and in no need of supervision. Whoops, sorry. Just ran into somebody, and he's down.",
        "LORELAI: [from upstairs] Wait, hold it. I'm coming.",
        "RORY: I assume you're very proud of me. Talk to you later.",
        "LORELAI: [running down stairs] Rory, I'm here. [answering machine clicks] Ohh. Of course, you had to be in a big hurry. [calls Rory back and gets voice mail]",
        "RORY'S VOICE MAIL: It's Rory. Talk, please.",
        "LORELAI: Hi. Yeah, of course I'm proud. Card swiping -- who knew you had it in you? Not I. I'm sorry I can't be there to witness this moment. It's certainly as big a moment as, oh, your first baby step and your first fall on your face, which came back to back. Hopefully, somebody's taking lots of pictures. Call my cell or call me at Jason's. We gotta stop meeting like this, hon. Bye.",

        "[Rory sits at card swiping table studying and ignoring nearby students.]",
        "GLENN: Hey, Rory, if you're gonna completely ignore me, I might as well go hang out with my ex-girlfriend. Same thing.",
        "RORY: Oh, sorry, Glenn. [swipes his card through reader]",
        "GLENN: Everyone is going to be sorry one day -- everyone. [walks off]",
        "RORY: You really gotta stop watching \"Taxi Driver,\" Glenn. [returns to studying - impatient student swipes her own card] Oh, did you want me to -- well, it works for me. [cell phone rings] Hello?",

        "RORY: Dean, hi.",
        "DEAN: Bad time?",
        "RORY: No. I just thought you would be my mom, but my mom doesn't speak in a resonant basso profundo.",
        "DEAN: A what? [grinning]",
        "RORY: I'm babbling.",
        "DEAN: So I wanted to run something by you to see if it was okay.",
        "RORY: Sure.",
        "DEAN: You know the contractor, Tom?",
        "RORY: Grumpy puss?",
        "DEAN: That's him. He's offered me a job working on his crew. It's good pay. It's flexible hours.",
        "RORY: Excellent.",
        "DEAN: At the inn. Your mom's inn. Is that okay?",
        "RORY: The Dragonfly?",
        "DEAN: If it's not okay, I won't do it.",
        "RORY: Why wouldn't it be okay?",
        "DEAN: Well, it would occasionally put you and me around each other, and I didn't know how awkward that would be.",
        "RORY: No. Dean, it's fine. It wouldn't be awkward at all.",
        "DEAN: You're sure?",
        "RORY: Tom knows quality when he sees it -- take the job.",
        "DEAN: Good, I just didn't know where we stood after my wedding and all.",
        "RORY: Oh.",
        "DEAN: You guys didn't come.",
        "RORY: Yeah, I'm so sorry about that.",
        "DEAN: It was short notice.",
        "RORY: And we got jammed on some things. But you got our gift?",
        "DEAN: Yeah, Lindsay spins a salad in it every night.",
        "RORY: That's weird, considering we got you a toaster.",
        "DEAN: No, you didn't. [realizes she's kidding]",
        "RORY: I'm joshing ya.",
        "DEAN: So, I guess I'll take the job.",
        "RORY: Are you still going to school, too?",
        "DEAN: Part time, but everything's good. I've got a five-year plan.",
        "RORY: Five years. Cool. I've got about the next two and a half hours planned, and then there's just darkness and possibly some dragons.",
        "DEAN: Hey, I made the plunge. I got my own cellphone.",
        "RORY: I thought you sounded a little cellphone-y.",
        "DEAN: Lindsay and her mom got a good deal on a family plan, so I signed up.",
        "RORY: It was time. You know, I don't even know your number anymore.",
        "DEAN: I can give you this one.",
        "RORY: Actually, I can just save it. You are officially part of my phone log.",
        "DEAN: Good. [pause] Well, I'll let you go, and uh, I'll see you once in awhile.",
        "RORY: Inevitability.",
        "DEAN: And you'll have to tell me what that bass thing was that you said.",
        "RORY: Something to look forward to.",
        "DEAN: Bye.",
        "RORY: Bye. [looks up to see long line of students needing their ID cards swiped] Come on. Come on! Step up, step up. Don't be mice.",

        "[Lorelai is lying in bed, talking on her cell phone - business, Jason is pacing back and forth also talking on his cell phone - business]",
        "LORELAI: No, we did pick a tile for the bedroom suite bathroom. I distinctly remember.",
        "JASON: Uh-huh. Make it a semicolon before the clause about interest rates and keep reading.",
        "LORELAI: Eight weeks ago, ten weeks ago?",
        "JASON: No, it is okay to end a sentence with a preposition now. I read it in Safire's column.",
        "LORELAI: I remember the guy, I don't remember the tile. I do remember the color, white.",
        "JASON: Safire. He came up with nattering nabobs of negativism for Agnew.",
        "LORELAI: No, I meant the tile was white, but the guy was, too.",
        "JASON: Agnew was Nixon's vice president. You know we're getting a little off the subject. Can you just please keep reading?",
        "LORELAI: Over 200 shades of white? I did not know that.",
        "JASON: With sincerely yours, et cetera, forge my signature and get it out tonight.",
        "LORELAI: We'll look at the samples again and that's okay.",

        "LORELAI: Thank you. All right, bye-bye.",
        "JASON: Okay, I am done. Uh, round two? [gets in bed]",
        "LORELAI: Well, this is very romantic. I mean, I'm over here arguing about tile, and you're over there arguing about William Safire. Whatever happened to the cigarette after s*x?",
        "JASON: Oh no. Trust me, William Safire is much hotter. [They kiss.]",
        "LORELAI: We're the all-business corporate couple.",
        "JASON: Brought to you by Marriott.",
        "[A cell phone rings.]",

        "LORELAI: Uh-huh. [She climbs out of bed and begins dressing.]",
        "JASON: What are you doing?",
        "EMILY: Your father has to run over to her house to open it up for her, and then she will be coming over here for the evening to berate me and tell me that my couch has some sort of smell.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, well, that sounds fun.",
        "EMILY: She wants to have lunch -- sorry, a luncheon -- the day after tomorrow. You, me, your father, and apparently she wants to meet Jason. All we need is that filthy Eminem fellow to make it a perfect afternoon for me.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I'll try to track him down, Mom, but you know, he might be on tour or something.",
        "EMILY: Just be here and be on time, and get your hair cut. You looked like the bird lady from Mary Poppins the last time I saw you.",
        "LORELAI: Well, Mom, I've been very busy lately.",
        "EMILY: I don't care how busy you've been, Lorelai. If your hair looks a mess, it will be my fault, and I don't need that responsibility right now. I'll see you at noon. [hangs up]",
        "[Lorelai gets undressed.]",
        "JASON: What are you doing?I",
        "LORELAI: I'm getting undressed.",
        "JASON: You were already undressed.",
        "LORELAI: Well, my mother called.",
        "JASON: So?",
        "LORELAI: So, I can't talk to my mother naked.",
        "JASON: How would she know?",
        "LORELAI: She'd know. [gets into bed]",
        "JASON: Is it like a super power? She can hear naked people?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, she can. She can hear sin and depravity and all sorts of lustful things.",

        "[Lorelai talks on a cell phone.]",
        "LORELAI: Please, please, please try to work me in. My hair is long and unmanageable, and I need that scalp-massaging thing that Cindy does after she washes my hair. It makes me think I'm in Tahiti.",
        "SOOKIE: [rushes in excitedly] Hey! They put pipes in the kitchen. We're almost able to run water!",
        "LORELAI: Sookie, give me a second here. Is Cindy there -- she's usually able to work me in. I'm not trying to go around you. Cindy and I are old friends.",
        "SOOKIE: They are beautiful pipes. The pipes are really big!",
        "LORELAI: Sookie, the pipes will be there in two minutes?",
        "SOOKIE: Sure. [exits]",
        "LORELAI: Look, it won't take long. It's an easy cut. I'm very low maintenance. I might not seem like it now, but I'd be a delight to have in the place, and I'll even dry my own hair. I'll bring my own blow dryer, even. Yes? Tomorrow? Yes. Eleven o'clock, I'll be there. Thank you, thank you, thank you.",
        "DEAN: Hi, Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, Dean. So you're working here?",
        "DEAN: Yeah, I thought maybe Rory would have told you.",

        "LORELAI: She's very thrilled about the pipes.",
        "TOM: Yeah, they're terrific pipes, and you got that fancy sink coming in tomorrow morning.",
        "SOOKIE: And you told them they can't install it until I see it, right? Because I have very specific sink needs.",
        "TOM: They won't even leave it without your approval. [hesitates] Can you guys give us a little space here? [nearby workers walk off]",
        "LORELAI: You okay, Tom?",
        "TOM: This is kind of tricky.",
        "SOOKIE: What is?",
        "TOM: You know I like you two, right?",
        "LORELAI: We know that.",
        "SOOKIE: Sure.",
        "TOM: I gotta deal with a lot of jerks in my business, yelling at you when it's not your fault, bugging you about budget increases you got no control over. You don't do that.",
        "LORELAI: Uh-hm.",
        "TOM: You always smell good, too. That's a plus. So maybe the checks are getting lost in the mail. I'm guessing it's something like that.",
        "SOOKIE: The checks? What checks? Our checks?",
        "TOM: It's just, in the last few weeks, we've been having some cash flow issues. Oh, this is hard.",

        "LORELAI: That would be embarrassing.",
        "SOOKIE: More embarrassing than Tom almost crying because we're not paying him?",
        "LORELAI: No, I guess not.",
        "SOOKIE: I'll put my thinking cap on, you put yours on, and if we come up with someone better, we'll talk. But we'll keep Luke as a last resort.",
