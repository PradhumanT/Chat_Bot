        "Now that Luke and Lorelai are back together, Lorelai can come into the diner. They make a date to celebrate getting back together. Rory and Logan are still dating, however not exclusively. Rory and Lorelai see him with another girl while they are shopping in downtown New Haven, but when Rory goes to Finn's birthday party with Robert, Logan gets jealous. Emily and Richard assume that since Emily gave instructions to Luke to get back together with Lorelai everything must be all set now. However, they are surprised to see only Rory show up for Friday dinner."

        "LUKE'S DINER",
        "[Kirk is sitting at a table in the center, yelling loudly. There is a bin half filled with pink and blue ribbons in front of him.]",
        "KIRK: Ribbons here! Return your ribbons here! That's right, folks! [A couple enters the diner and deposits their blue ribbons into the bin.] Thank you, sir. In the box, ma'am. Ribbons here, return your ribbons here!",
        "LUKE: Kirk, stop that.",
        "KIRK: Can't stop yet, Luke. Haven't got them all yet.",
        "LUKE: I mean it, put the box away.",
        "KIRK: Luke, you and Lorelai have reconciled.",
        "LUKE: I know, Kirk. I was there.",
        "KIRK: And since you two have reconciled, it's only appropriate that the citizens of Stars Hollow take off their pins and start to heal. In my case, literally. I caught about an inch of chest-flesh with this sharp little sucker.",
        "LUKE: Kirk -",
        "[Lulu walks past the diner. Kirk jumps out of his seat and yells at her through the window.]",
        "KIRK: Lulu! Hey!",
        "LULU: No, Kirk! I like my ribbon! It's pink! I like pink!",
        "KIRK: This is bigger than your love of pink!",
        "LULU [screams dramatically]: No!",
        "[Lulu takes off down the street.]",
        "KIRK: Lulu! Lulu, get back here! Lulu! [He leaves the diner to run after her. Lorelai enters.]",
        "LORELAI: Wow, did you see that?",
        "LUKE: You know, if someone opened a store in this town selling giant butterfly nets, they'd make a fortune.",
        "LORELAI: Come on, the crazy need love too.",
        "LUKE: Speaking of which - [they kiss] Welcome back.",
        "LORELAI: Nice to be here.",
        "LUKE: Want some coffee?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, say that again, slower and with your pants off.",
        "LUKE: What's that? [He gestures at the counter.]",
        "LORELAI: My pretty, pretty face?",
        "LUKE: That's a Weston's coffee cup.",
        "LORELAI: Is it?",
        "LUKE: You bring an enemy coffee cup in here on the day of our reconciliation.",
        "LORELAI [with a mobster accent]: At least I didn't ask you for a favor on this, the day of our daughter's wedding.",
        "LUKE: Get that coffee out of here.",
        "LORELAI: This is not coffee. This is a mocha chocolate caramel swirl-a-chino with extra whip cream.",
        "LUKE: That sounds disgusting.",
        "LORELAI: It is. And if it was physically possible to make love to a hot beverage, this would be the one.",
        "LUKE: So apparently I've got competition.",
        "LORELAI: No, no, no. It's just a fling. I'll finally spend the night with it, but then when I see it in the morning with the caramel un-swirled and the whip cream un-whipped, huh! Buh-bye.",
        "[Kirk opens the door, panting. He is holding Lulu's sweater, complete with its pink ribbon.]",
        "KIRK: Man, that was hard. [Pause.] She must have stretched first. [He tosses the sweater into the bin.]",
        "OPENING CREDITS",
        "YALE CAMPUS",
        "[Evening. Rory and Logan are walking together. Logan has his arm around Rory's waist.]",
        "RORY: So, judging from the snoring I'm guessing you love the theater.",
        "LOGAN: That was not a snore. That was a groan.",
        "RORY: It was not a painful play.",
        "LOGAN: Any play is a painful play for me.",
        "RORY: Well, that's too bad, because you're going to miss out on some wonderful things.",
        "LOGAN: Yeah, like what?",
        "RORY [smiling]: My mom took me to see Caroline, or Change in New York, Tony Kushner's musical, and it was the most amazing thing we ever saw. Tony Kushner wrote Angels in America.",
        "LOGAN: I know who Tony Kushner is.",
        "RORY: So you've seen his plays?",
        "LOGAN: No, my mom plays Canasta with him every month he's in town.",
        "RORY: Tony Kushner plays Canasta with your mother?",
        "LOGAN: Badly, but yes.",
        "RORY: You have a magical life, Huntzberger! And you don't even know it.",
        "LOGAN: So, where to next?",
        "RORY: Oh, I don't know. Mah Jongg with Mamet?",
        "LOGAN: How does ice cream sound?",
        "RORY: Ice cream sounds great.",
        "LOGAN: Then ice cream it is. [He takes her hand and pulls her toward one of the buildings.]",
        "RORY: Whoa, Logan! Where are we going? Slow down.",
        "LOGAN: Slow down and you die, Ace.",
        "RORY: Yeah, you go too fast in heels and you kind of die also.",
        "[He pulls her into a dark doorway, which he opens with a key.]",
        "YALE CAMPUS - DINING HALL",
        "[It is dark. Rory and Logan enter.]",
        "RORY: What are we doing?",
        "LOGAN: We're getting ice cream.",
        "RORY: But the dining hall's closed. We're breaking in.",
        "LOGAN: That's a very negative way of looking at it.",
        "RORY: How do you have a key to the dining hall?",
        "LOGAN: I know a lot of very powerful locksmiths.",
        "RORY: Well, what happens if we get caught? Could we get suspended? They can't kick you out of school for this, can they?",
        "LOGAN: Hey, relax. Look around. For tonight this is all yours.",
        "RORY: It is kind of cool.",
        "LOGAN: Wait till you see the kitchen.",
        "RORY: Whoa! Oh, I've never seen the cereal completely full before. I'm never here early enough! I knew they had Cocoa Puffs.",
        "LOGAN: Go crazy, Ace.",
        "RORY: No, we're getting ice cream.",
        "LOGAN: There's no rule that says you can't have ice cream and cereal. Go on, get your Cocoa Puffs.",
        "RORY [reaches for a bowl]: First Cocoa Puffs of the day. This is a historic moment.",
        "LOGAN: Okay. Next stop, ice cream.",
        "RORY: Mm.",
        "LOGAN: What are you doing?",
        "RORY: I'm looking for the swipe machine so I can deduct points from my meal plan.",
        "LOGAN: You're kidding, right?",
        "RORY: Well, the school pays for the food.",
        "LOGAN: Trust me. With all the money my family has donated to this school, they can afford to be out of a few Cocoa Puffs. Let's go.",
        "RORY: This is fun.",
        "LOGAN: You're an easy girl to please. [They kiss.] Let's hit the kitchen.",
        "RORY: 'Kay.",
        "[They walk toward the kitchen. Almost at the door, Rory turns back and leaves a dollar at the cereal station.]",
        "LOGAN: Ace, come on!",
        "RORY: I'm coming!",
        "[They exit.]",
        "DRAGONFLY INN",
        "[Lorelai is walking around, giving orders.]",
        "LORELAI [to a maid dusting]: Oh, okay, thanks. That's enough there. Just make sure you get the stairs now. [To two men carrying flowers] Oh, no, those go outside. Anacencia will take care of you.",
        "[She enters the living room and sees Sookie.]",
        "LORELAI: Oh, what a surprise! A plate of cookies on the coffee table to match the basket of cupcakes on the reception desk.",
        "SOOKIE: What? I always do this.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, you always do this when a photographer from American Travel magazine is coming to photograph us for -",
        "SOOKIE and LORELAI [in unison]: One of the Top Ten Inns in Connecticut!",
        "SOOKIE [squeals]: I have no idea what you're talking about.",
        "LORELAI: You know, I moved the furniture in the bedrooms around four times last night.",
        "SOOKIE: And you ended up?",
        "LORELAI: With everything in exactly the same place I started with.",
        "[Sookie giggles.]",
        "LORELAI: Oh, the dining room looks beautiful.",
        "SOOKIE: Thank you.",
        "LORELAI: And, what a surprise, a cake on every table.",
        "SOOKIE: So no one has to share.",
        "[They walk into the library.]",
        "LORELAI: Okay, floor looks good, table looks good. Hey, what happened to our books?",
        "SOOKIE: What do you mean?",
        "LORELAI: All our beautiful, leather-bound books. Jonathon Swift, Edith Wharton, Charles Dickens. A lot of them are gone.",
        "SOOKIE: The guests must have swiped 'em.",
        "LORELAI: They swiped Jonathon Swift and left me with Clifford, the Big Red Dog and five copies of He's Just Not That Into You.",
        "SOOKIE: We've been airplane booked.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, we've got to get them out of here. Hey Eddie? [Eddie comes in.]",
        "Will you get these out of here? [He takes them from her and leaves.] I'll raid Rory's leftovers tonight.",
        "[Michel enters, wearing sunglasses, a t-shirt featuring a palm tree, and carrying two paper bags.]",
        "MICHEL: Well, there everybody is. Who missed Michel?",
        "LORELAI: Huh. Trick question?",
        "SOOKIE: How was California?",
        "MICHEL: Ah, you know, it is insanity. What is different about me?",
        "SOOKIE: You're wearing sunglasses inside?",
        "MICHEL: They're not sunglasses. They are eyewear. Everyone in Los Angeles wears pairs and pairs of eyewear.",
        "LORELAI: Well, you look great.",
        "MICHEL: Oh, I tell you, I belong out there. Everybody is thin and gorgeous. Oh, there is this place on Sunset Boulevard, a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, and everybody there talks exactly like me.",
        "LORELAI: Wow.",
        "MICHEL: I got Botox.",
        "SOOKIE: Ow.",
        "MICHEL: Dr. Wu, oh, she's a genius. Everyone goes there. And look. [He shows them his teeth.] I got them done by the same guy who does Nick Lachey. Okay, gather around. I brought gifts. [He holds up his bags.]",
        "LORELAI: Gifts, great!",
        "MICHEL: Oh, the shopping out there, unbelievable. Rodeo Drive, dig a hole and drop me in, even if I'm not dead yet. Okay, for you and for you. [He hands them their bags.]",
        "LORELAI [pulling out her gift]: Huh.",
        "MICHEL: It's a smog globe. [Laughs] They are so funny in California.",
        "SOOKIE [opening her gift]: Well, what do you know. [giggles a little] He's Just Not That Into You.",
        "MICHEL: I heard it's a fabulous book, and so true. Oh, I haven't told you the most amazing part yet.",
        "LORELAI: You got your boobs done by the same guy who did Pamela Anderson?",
        "MICHEL: No, though I did meet him at the Coffee Bean. I was at this place called the Farmer's Market, and I was just sitting there, minding anybody's business, and a man came up to me and asked if I would like to be a contestant on the Price is Right!",
        "LORELAI: You're kidding!",
        "MICHEL: I was so stunned! I mean, I never considered being on a game show, but I was finished with my Bubble Tea, so I figured, why not?",
        "SOOKIE: They just asked you to be on.",
        "MICHEL: Yes.",
        "SOOKIE: Boy, that's weird. Jackson's cousin Monty did the Price is Right, and he told us that the contestants had to get up at the crack of dawn, sit in line for hours, with hundreds of tourists, and then show how enthusiastic of a contestant they would be. You know, jumping up and down, screaming and yelling.",
        "MICHEL: You don't say.",
        "SOOKIE: Yeah. And they had to wear embarrassing t-shirts that said things like 'Pick Me, Bob! I neutered my dog!' And they spent weeks studying the price of Turtle wax and Hamburger Helper.",
        "MICHEL: Okay, fine! I may have jumped a little, but I did not wear a t-shirt.",
        "LORELAI: Michel. What would Nick Lachey's teeth guy say?",
        "MICHEL: Make fun if you want, but I walked away the winner of over a hundred thousand dollar of cash and prizes!",
        "LORELAI: Then what's with the cheap gifts?",
        "SOOKIE: That's not even that smoggy.",
        "MICHEL [getting up, muttering to himself]: Why do I talk to you? Why?",
        "LORELAI: All right. I'm going to go run over to Luke's and grab some dinner, and then I will be back to finish the setup.",
        "SOOKIE: Got it.",
        "LUKE'S DINER",
        "[A woman rushes out of the bathroom. Kirk follows her.]",
        "KIRK: Well, if you'd just put it in the box like I told you to, I wouldn't have had to follow you in. [He sets a pink ribbon into the box.]",
        "LUKE [to Lorelai]: Here's your fries.",
        "LORELAI: Mm, good.",
        "LUKE: Where's your burger?",
        "LORELAI: I ate it.",
        "LUKE: I was gone two seconds.",
        "LORELAI: Ketchup, please?",
        "LUKE: By the time I get the ketchup, the fries'll be gone.",
        "LORELAI: You're right, forget the ketchup.",
        "LUKE: Slow down!",
        "LORELAI: I can't slow down. I only have fifteen minutes before I have to get back to the inn.",
        "LUKE: You're going to make yourself sick.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, but my sickness will remind me of you, so it'll be romantic.",
        "LUKE: Romantic nausea.",
        "KIRK: I get that all the time.",
        "LORELAI: Hit me with the pie.",
        "LUKE: What pie?",
        "LORELAI: The boysenberry pie.",
        "LUKE: We're out of boysenberry pie.",
        "LORELAI: How can you be out of boysenberry pie?",
        "LUKE: Because someone ordered the last piece.",
        "LORELAI: But I specifically asked you to save me a piece of boysenberry pie.",
        "LUKE: Uh, no you didn't.",
        "LORELAI: Uh, yes I did.",
        "LUKE: When?",
        "LORELAI: I left you a message.",
        "LUKE: I never got a message.",
        "LORELAI: I left it on your cell phone.",
        "LUKE: Oh, is that what that annoying beeping sound was?",
        "LORELAI: Yes. It was telling you that your girlfriend called and asked you to save her some pie.",
        "LUKE: Well, I don't know how to use the voicemail.",
        "LORELAI [laughs]: You don't?",
        "LUKE: Or anything else on this stupid thing. I know how to make a call and answer a call and then I'm out.",
        "LORELAI: Give me that. You have got to learn how to use this thing because it is very powerful and wonderful, and it will change your life.",
        "LUKE: What are you doing?",
        "LORELAI: I am putting my number on speed-dial, so all you have to do is press one, see, like 'I'm number one' [she raises one hand in the air like a cheerleader] and then - [her cell phone rings in her purse] - oh, I wonder who that could be? [She pulls it out and answers it.] Hello?",
        "LUKE: Give me. [He takes his phone back from Lorelai and talks to her on it.] No cell phones in the diner.",
        "[They hang up their cell phones.]",
        "LORELAI: Oh, see, wasn't that fun?",
        "LUKE: Totally.",
        "LORELAI: Want me to put it on vibrate for you?",
        "LUKE: Fifteen minutes are up.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, crap, I got to go.",
        "LUKE: Take a donut.",
        "LORELAI: So then Sunday?",
        "LUKE: Pick you up at eight.",
        "LORELAI: I'll leave you a message letting you know your chances of getting lucky.",
        "[Luke rolls his eyes.]",
        "LORELAI: Hey, Kirk, how's the ribbon collecting coming?",
        "LUKE: Oh, why do you get him started?",
        "KIRK: I think we're near the finish line.",
        "LORELAI: Who's winning?",
        "LUKE: Hey, this isn't a contest.",
        "LORELAI: I just want to know.",
        "LUKE: I don't care who's winning.",
        "LORELAI: Well, then you won't care if it's me.",
        "LUKE [coming around the counter]: Well, of course it's you. You're the one who makes the costumes for the Christmas pageant. You make the ornaments for the Firelight Festival. You go to the town meetings. You say hello to people. You have a daughter that looks like she belongs on top of a Christmas tree. Everybody knows that gets you tons of points.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah.",
        "LUKE: There's no way to compete with that.",
        "LORELAI: Kirk?",
        "KIRK: You're kicking his ass.",
        "LORELAI: Yes!",
        "LUKE: This isn't a contest.",
        "LORELAI: No, not now, it isn't. Kirk, I want a final tally, because the ribbon loser is buying the ribbon winner dinner Sunday night.",
        "LUKE: Loser pays? When did we agree on that?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, gee, I must have left that on your voicemail too.",
        "[She leaves. Luke looks at Kirk.]",
        "RORY'S CAR",
        "[Evening. Rory is driving. Her cell phone rings, she answers it.]",
        "RORY: Hey Mom.",
        "[Scene cuts to Star's Hollow street where Lorelai is walking, carrying a bag from Luke's.]",
        "LORELAI: Hey. How would you feel about doing a little shopping tomorrow?",
        "RORY: Hurt. Confused. A little dirty.",
        "LORELAI: I need to get a new getting-back-together-with-Luke dress for my back-together-with-Luke date.",
        "RORY: Oh, where do you want to go?",
        "LORELAI: How about the new place where you got the scarf with the bows on it?",
        "RORY: Oh, yes, cute place.",
        "LORELAI: I want to go to the cute place.",
        "RORY: Ten o'clock?",
        "LORELAI: I'll be the one holding coffee. So, uh, what are you doing tonight?",
        "RORY: Mom.",
        "LORELAI: What? Are you driving? Sounds like you're driving.",
        "RORY: I am driving.",
        "LORELAI: You are? Where are you going?",
        "RORY: You know where I'm going, Mom.",
        "LORELAI: Disneyland?",
        "RORY: Nope.",
        "LORELAI: Puppy world?",
        "RORY: You're so immature. You're going to make me say it?",
        "LORELAI: Say what?",
        "RORY [sighs]: I am on my way to Friday night dinner.",
        "LORELAI: Ah-ha-ha! That's right. You're on the road to Hellville.",
        "RORY: Do not gloat.",
        "LORELAI: I'm not gloating. I'm gloating with hand gestures.",
        "RORY: Bye.",
        "LORELAI: And a little soft shoe.",
        "RORY: Got to go.",
        "LORELAI: Listen, enjoy your glazed woodcock with a side of truffled goose head.",
        "RORY: Oh, what a shame, I'm here.",
        "LORELAI: You are not.",
        "RORY: See you tomorrow.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, Rory, wait. I'm gloating with jazz hands.",
        "RORY: Bye, Mom.",
        "[She hangs up.]",
        "LUKE'S DINER",
        "[The diner is nearly dark. Kirk is the last customer.]",
        "LUKE: Finish up, Kirk. I'm closing up early.",
        "KIRK: You're going to see Lorelai tonight, aren't you?",
        "LUKE: Actually no, she's working. I'm going to see her Sunday night.",
        "KIRK: That sounds nice. You guys probably spend a lot of time together.",
        "LUKE: Yes, we do.",
        "KIRK: And you probably sleep over at each other's houses, too.",
        "LUKE [coming over to his table]: Cookies are on the house, Kirk. Just go, okay?",
        "KIRK: You know, Lulu's my first real girlfriend. I had an imaginary girlfriend for a while when I was young, but she left me.",
        "LUKE: Well, that happens.",
        "[Luke picks up the chair opposite Kirk to put it up on the table.]",
        "KIRK: I wish Lulu and I could have what you and Lorelai have.",
        "LUKE: Oh, you can have that, Kirk. You will have that. In fact, why don't you leave, and go have it right now?",
        "KIRK: You know, I live with my mother.",
        "LUKE [muttering to himself]: Apparently I'm officially in this conversation, don't know how it happened, but -",
        "[Luke puts the chair back on the floor and sits on it.]",
        "KIRK: My mother is allergic to Lulu. The minute Lulu comes in the room, my mother will cough and choke and turn red. Her throat closes up, everything gets puffy. Lulu's tried everything. She changed her soap, her perfume, shampoo, cream rinse, deodorant. She's actually kind of a mess right now. But nothing seems to work.",
        "LUKE: Kirk -",
        "KIRK: Obviously I can't have Mother choking three times a week, so I considered constructing a separate entrance to my room, so that Lulu won't actually have to walk through the house, but that's going to cost about forty thousand dollars, 'cause I'd have to break through a bearing wall, and",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "LUKE: Kirk, stop! This is ridiculous. You're a grown man. You have got to change your living situation.",
        "KIRK: My mother won't move out. I've asked.",
        "LUKE: I'm not talking about your mother. I'm talking about you.",
        "KIRK: Me?",
        "LUKE: Yes, you. Get a life. Get some independence. Get out of there.",
        "KIRK: But -",
        "LUKE: You want to have a real relationship with Lulu?",
        "KIRK: Yes.",
        "LUKE: Then grow up. Be a man.",
        "KIRK: I'm not sure I understand what you're saying to me.",
        "LUKE [getting up]: Well, Kirk, I have given you the Lincoln logs, and you have to build the cabin. [He shuts off the light.] Lock the door behind you.",
        "[Luke heads upstairs.]",
        "KIRK: You're not talking about a real cabin, are you? 'Cause if a new entrance is going to cost forty grand, then a cabin has got to be more.",
        "LUKE [from upstairs]: Good night, Kirk!",
        "ELDER GILMORE'S HOUSE",
        "[The doorbell rings. Richard rushes toward the door.]",

        "LORELAI [confused]: And you like this Robert, right?",
        "RORY: Right. You know. The party's a Quentin Tarantino themed party, and you have to wear a costume, so I'm going as Gogo.",
        "LORELAI: 'Cause you have the skirt.",
        "RORY: And no other ideas.",
        "LORELAI: Cluelessness is the mother of invention. Call me after.",
        "RORY: I will do that.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, this dress is too slutty.",
        "RORY: The dress is fine. The person in it, however -",

        "LUKE [points at the house]: No, but I always -",
        "LORELAI: I know. Yeah, I know.",
        "LUKE: No, I should've.",
        "[There is an awkward pause. They are smiling at each other.]",
        "LORELAI: 'Kay, this is stupid.",
        "LUKE: Yes, it is.",
        "LORELAI: It's not like we've never done this before.",
        "LUKE: We have.",
        "LORELAI: And successfully.",

        "[He puts his arm around her and they walk to the truck. Lorelai gets in, Luke closes her car door and walks around.]",
        "LUKE: So I thought we'd go to Marino's. You like Marino's, right?",
        "LORELAI: Mmm. [Her attention is on the C.D. in her hand. She looks baffled as she holds it up.] What is this?",
        "LUKE: What?",
        "LORELAI: Reggae Fever?",
        "LUKE: So?",
        "LORELAI: When did you buy this? Where did you buy this? Why did you buy this?",
        "LUKE: I was at the gas station last week. It was at the register. What's the big deal?",
        "LORELAI: The big deal is it's Reggae Fever.",
        "LUKE: I know!",
        "LORELAI: When you look in the mirror, do you see Reggae Fever?",
        "LUKE: It was cheap.",
        "LORELAI: 'Ja Glory' by Toots Bambada. 'Lively up Yourself' by the Family Zigzag, 'Let your Ya be Ya' by Ranking Roy. What else am I going to find in here? Ganja and a yellow, green and red knit cap?",
        "LUKE: I bought a C.D. I didn't adopt the entire Rastafarian culture.",
        "LORELAI: This is so weird. I mean, to think that there was this whole chunk of time when we weren't together. We were living totally separate lives. I was just working like crazy and you were running around, buying reggae C.D.'s.",
        "LUKE: One C.D. One.",
        "LORELAI [sighs]: I just hate that we were apart.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, wasn't too fond of it myself.",
        "LORELAI: Well, all I can say is, you're lucky I'm back in your life, because clearly you were lost without me. I mean, it's a miracle you're even still alive. Right?",

        "ROBERT: Happy birthday, Finn. You owe me forty dollars.",
        "FINN: Well, maybe for my birthday you'll forgive me that. [Robert gives him a serious look. Finn pulls out his wallet.] Does your father have any idea what a toll his cross-dressing took on your psyche?",
        "ROBERT: That was your father, Finn.",
        "FINN: Ah, you're right. [He holds up his hands to display the painted fingernails.] My God, that explains a lot. Do I know you?",
        "ROBERT: Rory Gilmore, Finn.",
        "FINN: Pleasure to meet you. [Rory smiles awkwardly.] All right, children, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we will all be in a great deal of pain. [He takes the tray of shots from the girl who is walking past again.] Thank you, darling. Your name and phone number would also be appreciated. [She walks away. Finn winks and dances after her.]",
        "RORY: Finn's quite an original.",
        "ROBERT: Yes, he is. Have I told you I like your costume?",
        "RORY: No, you didn't.",
        "[She sees Logan on a couch with the Bride. His costume is Butch Coolidge. He smiles at Rory.]",
        "ROBERT: All right. Did that count, or are you expecting me to say it again?",
        "RORY: I think we're good.",
        "[Cut over to Logan on the couch.]",
        "LOGAN: Let's get a drink.",

        "COLIN: I went to go pick her up. She's dressed like Mira Sorvino.",
        "ROBERT: How do you dress like Mira Sorvino?",
        "COLIN: You have blonde hair and a name tag that says 'Mira Sorvino'. I just turned around and left.",

        "WHITNEY: Leave her alone, Colin.",
        "COLIN: Yes, yes. Of course. [He goes.]",

        "ROBERT: Seems like it.",
        "RORY: Music's cool.",
        "LOGAN: Very cool. Well, we're just heading over to the bar, can we get you two anything?",
        "ROBERT: No, we're just going to take a look around.",
        "LOGAN: Okay, well, catch you later.",

        "[They get out of the truck.]",
        "LORELAI: I've got news for you. That was not the same song.",

        "[They head over to find out what it is. Luke picks up a shovel.]",
        "LORELAI: Huh. Weird time for gardening, isn't it?",
        "LUKE: It could be like a raccoon.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, hey, don't shovel the raccoon.",
        "LUKE: Just stay back, will you?",
        "LORELAI: No, Luke! You can't hurt a raccoon. They're cute. They have face masks like little furry burglars.",
        "LUKE: And sharp teeth that chew through your wiring, and rabies -",
        "LORELAI: Luke.",
        "LUKE: I'm not going to hit it, I'm going to scare it.",

        "[Luke pushes around her and into the garage. Lorelai follows him.]",

        "KIRK: I left Mother's.",
        "LORELAI: No, did you have a fight? Did she take away your Beach Boys album again?",
        "KIRK: No, I just got so excited about the thought of a new life, you know? Of striking out on my own and being my own man. Right, Luke?",
        "LORELAI: Right, Luke?",
        "KIRK: So I did it. I packed my clothes and I gave my mother my key and I said good bye and I left.",
        "LORELAI: Aw, Kirk. That's a big deal, you leaving like that.",
        "KIRK: I know it is. But Luke explained to me that if I really want to move to the next level with Lulu and have a real, grownup relationship, with sleepovers and everything, then I had to get out.",
        "LUKE: I don't think that's exactly what I said.",
        "KIRK: Oh, yes, it was. And I felt really good about it, until I realized that I had no place to go. I probably should have found an apartment first.",
        "LUKE: Probably.",
        "LORELAI: You can stay in Rory's room.",
        "KIRK: Really?",
        "LUKE: Really?",

        "LUKE: Kirk was at the diner talking about how he wished how he and Lulu had what we have, and I just mentioned -",
        "LORELAI: Are you insane? Everybody knows you can't mention anything to Kirk.",
        "LUKE: I was cornered. I was tired. I wanted to go to sleep.",
        "LORELAI: Well, now we have to go in there and take care of him. He is now our responsibility.",

        "ROBERT: So, how about that drink?",

But then in the morning, I controlled the bathroom, and the, and the Pop-tarts, and she had to deal with me. And eventually we'd make up and it was over. But now -",
