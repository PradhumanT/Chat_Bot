        "It's Thanksgiving, and Lorelai and Rory have dinner at four different places: the Kim's, where Lane has managed to get Dave invited and Lorelai is forced to eat tofurkey; Luke's, where Luke and Jess make it a foursome with Lorelai and Rory; Sookie's, where Jackson and his family have deep-fried the turkey, the lawn and just about everything else; and Emily and Richard's, where, to Lorelai's horror, Rory reveals that she has applied to Yale. Kirk gets a cat, with disastrous results; Dave asks Lane out, and then kisses her; Paris is afraid her difficulty getting into a shelter will impact her acceptance to Harvard; and Dean faces off with Jess and lets him know that it's no more \"Mr. Nice Guy\" for Mr. Forester."

        "RORY: I like these women.",
        "LORELAI: I love these women.",
        "RORY: Poor Edie.",
        "LORELAI: Which Edie?",
        "RORY: Little Edie. She's just trying to sing and her mom won't stop talking.",
        "LORELAI: Big Edie was so beautiful in her day.",
        "RORY: They were both pretty.",
        "LORELAI: I can't believe they were related to Jackie.",
        "RORY: Well, the Kennedy's kind of hid them in the background for many years.",
        "LORELAI: Well, when you're a Kennedy, how do you even choose who in the family to hide?",
        "RORY: It's a tough choice.",
        "LORELAI: Something beautiful about them though. They're cool, they're free.",
        "RORY: Yeah, and they're memorable. Most people are very forgettable. And they're happy.",
        "LORELAI: They had their cats.",
        "RORY: And their raccoons.",
        "LORELAI: And their pretty house.",
        "RORY: And each other.",
        "LORELAI: Add a few years and they're us.",
        "RORY: Yeah. . .yeah.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah.",

        "CUT TO THE INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN",
        "[Sookie rushes around giving instructions]",
        "SOOKIE: Rhiana, run it through the sieve again, I want it smooth as glass. Don't cut corners, people!",
        "LORELAI: Is she melting down?",
        "MICHEL: Like butter on a skillet.",
        "LORELAI: Sookie. . .",
        "SOOKIE: Just a sec, hon. How's your love life, Pete? A little frustrated, I bet. Wondering how I know that? \u0091Cause you're taking it out on my egg whites. Gently, fold them gently. Cheryl \u0096 you're slicing not dicing, I can hear it in the chop. Adjust, my friend.",
        "LORELAI: Sookie, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, let's talk.",
        "SOOKIE: I'm extremely lacking in time here.",
        "LORELAI: What's going on?",
        "SOOKIE: Uh, chaos? Uh, a travesty of cooking? It's a salmonella laboratory in here!",
        "LORELAI: Sookie, the kitchen will be in good hands.",
        "SOOKIE: But not in my hands.",
        "LORELAI: It'll be in Bob hands. Bob has great hands.",
        "SOOKIE: No, you know what Bob has? Bob has two seconds to get the hollandaise off the flame before I break his neck!",
        "LORELAI: Sookie, listen, you hired Bob. You trained him in your image. He's great, and he's subbed for you before.",
        "SOOKIE: But this is Thanksgiving, he has never done Thanksgiving.",
        "LORELAI: He's ready, he'll sub for you seamlessly. Even Big Joe Newsanchor's have substitutes.",
        "SOOKIE: And that's the thing. They still say, \u0091And now the CBS Evening News with Dan Rather.' You see? Dan is still associated with it even though he's off snorkeling or something, just like I'm gonna be associated with the dinner because Bob is substituting for Sookie. Excuse me one minute.",
        "[Sookie starts rummaging through the trash can]",
        "MICHEL: Oh, this can only be good.",
        "LORELAI: Sookie, that's the garbage. Stop rooting through the garbage.",
        "SOOKIE: I will when people stop throwing away useful stuff!",
        "LORELAI: Drop, drop the, drop the tops, drop them, drop them. Come here, come here, come here. Now, Sookie, listen to me because you're torturing yourself here.",
        "[Emily walks in and stands behind Lorelai]",
        "SOOKIE: Emily, hi.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, that's nice. That's very high school. Stick with me here.",
        "SOOKIE: Good to see you.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, ah, that's funny. You know who's behind you? It's Joseph Stalin, my good friend. What are you doing back from the dead, Joe?",
        "EMILY: Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, Mom! Ah, geez, you scared me.",
        "EMILY: You heard Sookie greet me.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, I thought it was a joke.",
        "EMILY: Like comparing me to Joseph Stalin?",
        "LORELAI: I wasn't comparing you to Joseph Stalin.",
        "EMILY: I'm in a hurry. Can we speak for a minute?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, I guess, for a minute. So, were you in the area or something?",
        "EMILY: Not really.",
        "LORELAI: Then what are you doing here?",
        "EMILY: I wanted to talk to you.",
        "LORELAI: Phone's out of order?",
        "EMILY: Let's not play games here.",
        "LORELAI: Games?",
        "EMILY: I've called several times the past few weeks and you've skillfully avoided every call.",
        "LORELAI: No, that's not true. I've left messages on your machine.",
        "EMILY: Yes, messages. And then if I happened to pick up, you'd hang up. Or if the maid picked up, you'd ask for me, then claim you were driving through a tunnel so you might get cut off, and then you'd make garbling noises and hang up.",
        "LORELAI: Fine, Mom, we're talking now. What's up?",
        "EMILY: Are you feeling well?",
        "LORELAI: You came all the way out here to ask me that?",
        "EMILY: Well, you've been sick these past few Friday's for dinner, so I was concerned. That's why you didn't come, right, because you were sick? So are you better? You look fine.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, it's the makeup. I'm still. . .uh, these allergies really just hit me like a ton of bricks.",
        "EMILY: I've never heard you mention allergies before.",
        "LORELAI: I'm a silent sufferer.",
        "EMILY: Well, I certainly hope you're feeling better now because I want you to come to dinner tomorrow night.",
        "LORELAI: Tomorrow? Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.",
        "EMILY: Yes, it is Thanksgiving. And before you sift through the dozen or so excuses you always have on hand, let me have my say. You've missed two dinners and avoided my calls because you're mad at us about what happened at Yale. But I want you and Rory at Thanksgiving this year.",
        "LORELAI: Mom \u0096",
        "EMILY: If you have plans \u0096",
        "LORELAI: We do have plans.",
        "EMILY: Alter them. Now, there'll be other people there, so the focus won't be on you, and you may even be able to get by without saying more than \u0091hello', \u0091goodbye', and \u0091pass the gravy'.",
        "LORELAI: We already have plans.",
        "EMILY: Your father and I are going out of town the next day and we'll be gone all of December, including Christmas, so it's the last chance for the family to be together for the rest of the year.",
        "LORELAI: Look \u0096",
        "EMILY: And I want you to remember that I am not the one who set the meeting for Rory behind your back. I want you there, Lorelai. And if you're still sick, I don't want a doctor's note. I want your doctor himself to come to my house and convince me that it's true, got it?",
        "LORELAI: Got it.",
        "EMILY: See you tomorrow.",
        "CUT TO CHILTON",
        "TEACHER: The multi-layered membrane systems of the cytoplasm are the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and the golgi body. Now, the smooth endoplasmic reticulum is concerned with the manufacture of lipid molecules. [bell rings] We'll continue on this next week. Keep up on your reading please.",
        "MADELINE: That was really distracting.",
        "PARIS: Oh. Well, by all means, Madeline, you should point out to the faculty that their annoying custom of teaching is distracting you from more important things like nail filing and daydreaming about marrying Ryan Phillippe.",
        "LOUISE: Uh, he's already married.",
        "PARIS: Then whatever strawhead actor isn't.",
        "MADELINE: This was bad. For the last five minutes, every single thing she said sounded dirty.",
        "LOUISE: Yeah, same here.",
        "PARIS: Good God.",
        "MADELINE: I mean, reticulum? Come on.",
        "LOUISE: Plus, the golgi body. I mean, is it me or is that majorly pornographic?",
        "PARIS: My life with the Banger sisters.",
        "RORY: So, changing the subject. . .",
        "PARIS: Hallelujah.",
        "RORY: What's everybody doing for Thanksgiving?",
        "PARIS: I can't even talk about Thanksgiving.",
        "RORY: Louise?",
        "LOUISE: I\u0091m having dinner with my dad.",
        "MADELINE: Isn't he still in jail?",
        "LOUISE: Yes, but his company donated some treadmills for the inmates so he swung a special trailer for dinner that they're gonna set up for us in the parking lot. We have it for about two hours and then one of the Manson girls gets us.",
        "MADELINE: You're lucky it's in that order.",
        "PARIS: My Thanksgiving is turning into a Wes Craven movie.",
        "RORY: How so?",
        "PARIS: I called shelters to volunteer to serve food. It's Thanksgiving \u0096 you'd think they have needs. Nope. Every stupid soup kitchen in town turned me down because they have enough volunteers.",
        "MADELINE: Bummer.",
        "PARIS: I'm on a couple waiting lists, but it doesn't look good.",
        "RORY: I've never heard of too many volunteers.",
        "PARIS: Who are all these jackasses who volunteered anyway? They can't all be students like me. They're not all putting it on a college application. I get something out of it and these other people don't get a thing. Talk about selfish.",
        "LOUISE: Sore subject.",
        "RORY: What are you up to, Madeline?",
        "MADELINE: I've got more college applications to fill out. Backups, safety schools.",
        "LOUISE: I've got some of that, too. I'm so behind.",
        "PARIS: I told you guys to have those things done by now.",
        "LOUISE: Sorry, Mom.",
        "PARIS: It's not about being sorry. It's about being prepared. I got Harvard and my backups in weeks ago.",
        "MADELINE: Okay, all you're doing is making me more nervous. I'll see you guys Monday.",
        "LOUISE: Same here.",
        "RORY: Yup, see you guys Monday.",
        "PARIS: Harvard is going to be expecting Thanksgiving shelter work. They'll know I called too late and it will totally impugn my organizational skills. By the way, you know I ultimately do all these things for the good of mankind, right?",
        "RORY: Oh yeah.",
        "PARIS: Sometimes I don't think I come off that way.",
        "RORY: No.",
        "[Paris' cell phone rings]",
        "PARIS: [answers phone] Hello? . . . Yes, thanks for returning my call. . . nothing? But wait, wait, wait \u0096 just stick me at any old pot. I'm small, you won't even know I'm there, I'll even bring my own ladle. . . .Oh, now, come on, work with me here. I've got a slotted spoon. . . Well, what about coffee or condiments? You got condiments covered? . . . I'm sorry, can I speak to your supervisor? . . . My attitude? What about your attitude? I'm trying to help people. It's Thanksgiving. . .",
        "CUT TO STARS HOLLOW",
        "[Lorelai and Rory are walking down the sidewalk]",
        "RORY: So she coldcocked you, huh?",
        "LORELAI: She bit me, incapacitated me with her poison, and devoured me whole.",
        "RORY: But how are we going to go to four Thanksgiving dinners?",
        "LORELAI: It's not four, is it?",
        "RORY: Lane's house, Sookie's, and we always stop by Luke's. . .that's three, and Grandma and Grandpa is four.",
        "LORELAI: Ah, we're mad, Edie.",
        "RORY: We're us, Edie.",
        "LORELAI: Well, we've gotta go to my parents' or we'll be brought up on war crimes. Lane's is always super early, so that's easy to catch. Sookie's is mid afternoon.",
        "RORY: Luke's the toughie.",
        "LORELAI: Guess that's the one we'll have to skip.",
        "RORY: Bummer.",
        "LORELAI: I know, but he won't care. Holidays are nothing to him anyway.",
        "[Kirk walks out of The Chat Club with several bags]",
        "LORELAI: Hey Kirk. Discover a new freaky fetish?",
        "KIRK: What?",
        "LORELAI: Nothing. You buy a cat?",
        "KIRK: Yup. I'm very excited.",
        "LORELAI: You seem it. So what's all this?",
        "RORY: I'm assuming there's nothing left in the store.",
        "KIRK: Actually, there are a number of things left.",
        "RORY: No, I meant you seem to be buying a lot of stuff.",
        "KIRK: Oh, sorry. My excitement must be clouding my ability to judge comedic hyperbole.",
        "LORELAI: So where'd you get the cat?",
        "KIRK: A lady had a bunch of them at the grocery store and Kirk seemed to take an instant liking to me.",
        "LORELAI: Kirk?",
        "KIRK: Yes?",
        "LORELAI: No, I mean, the cat's name is Kirk?",
        "KIRK: Yup.",
        "LORELAI: Weird coincidence or. . .",
        "KIRK: I named him Kirk.",
        "LORELAI: Isn't that confusing?",
        "KIRK: Not when you think about it.",
        "[Lorelai thinks about it]",
        "LORELAI: No, it's still confusing.",
        "KIRK: I like the name, and whenever I call Kirk's name, I obviously won't be calling myself.",
        "LORELAI: True.",
        "KIRK: Although when my mom calls for Kirk, that may be confusing. Maybe I can get her to say CatKirk when she's calling Kirk, and HumanKirk when she's calling me.",
        "RORY: That would keep it straight.",
        "KIRK: I'm glad I ran into you. See ya.",
        "LORELAI: See ya, HumanKirk.",
        "RORY: Bye HumanKirk.",
        "[Kirk walks away]",
        "RORY: He's always been a cat person, he's just never had a cat.",
        "LORELAI: Hm.",

        "[Lorelai and Rory walk in]",
        "LORELAI: Hey. Anywhere?",
        "LUKE: Anywhere.",
        "LORELAI: [to customer at table] Hm, would you mind moving?",
        "LUKE: I hate when you do that.",
        "LORELAI: It's my showstopper.",
        "LUKE: An empty table.",
        "LORELAI: Ah. You ready to order?",
        "RORY: I'm ready.",
        "LUKE: Don't bother, saw you coming, already ordered your Wednesday usual \u0096 the French dip, extra fries, the every-Wednesday cherry pie.",
        "RORY: Such service.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, and such a food rut we're in.",
        "RORY: Thank you, Luke.",
        "LUKE: I gotta get back to stuffing my turkey.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, honey, do you have time to do that and prep your Thanksgiving food?",
        "LUKE: Stop it.",
        "RORY: Here, here.",
        "LUKE: It's a tedious job.",
        "LORELAI: Well, what if we told you you could stuff one less?",
        "LUKE: What do you mean?",
        "LORELAI: We got jammed. Shanghaied by my mother and what with the other things we have going. . .well, too many commitments, not enough us.",
        "LUKE: So?",
        "RORY: We can't make it tomorrow.",
        "LUKE: Oh, okay, fine.",
        "LORELAI: It was beyond our control.",
        "LUKE: That's fine, whatever. I'll be right back. [walks away]",
        "LORELAI: Um, okay, I may be crazy, but he almost looked. . . .",
        "RORY: Disappointed.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, disappointed. We disappointed Luke.",
        "RORY: I didn't think it was possible.",
        "LORELAI: Our powers are greater than we know.",
        "RORY: He actually likes it when we come for Thanksgiving. All these years and we never knew.",
        "LORELAI: Hm, he's the Grinch and we're Cindy Lou Who.",
        "RORY: So Cindy Lou, what do we do?",
        "LORELAI: I got it.",
        "[Lorelai picks up her cell phone as Luke walks over]",
        "LORELAI: [on phone] Oh, uh, perfect. That works great. Okay, bye now. [hangs up] Sorry, I'm just clarifying the schedule for tomorrow. As luck has it, we can make it. We'll definitely be here.",
        "LUKE: It's okay.",
        "LORELAI: No, it's all cleared. That was my mom, and, uh, the time's just gonna work out just fine.",
        "LUKE: Really, you don't have to. I already stopped prepping the last turkey.",
        "LORELAI: Well, start prepping it again \u0091cause we are coming.",
        "LUKE: I don't want you to feel like you have to come.",
        "LORELAI: This is tiring.",
        "RORY: I can kneel behind him and you can push him over.",
        "LORELAI: It may come to that.",
        "LUKE: It won't be a hassle?",
        "LORELAI: It won't be a hassle.",
        "LUKE: You sure?",
        "LORELAI: We're coming, now go away and let us eat. Shoo, shoo.",
        "[Luke walks away]",
        "RORY: That was very nice.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I hate disappointing people.",
        "RORY: Okay, now, practical question. . . how are we going to eat four Thanksgiving dinners?",
        "LORELAI: How? Rory, what are we if not world champion eaters?",
        "RORY: It's too much food.",
        "LORELAI: It's not too much food. This is what we've been training for our whole lives. This is our destiny. This is our finest hour.",
        "RORY: Or final hour.",
        "LORELAI: No, no. Get inspired and tomorrow I guarantee you, we will be standing on the Olympic platform receiving our gold medals for eating. We are not Michelle Kwan-ing this.",
        "RORY: Okay, okay, four dinners.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, we'll skip the rolls.",
        "RORY: That'll help. You know, we might wanna consider not eating much now in preparation for our finest hour. A little fasting so that we can enjoy more tomorrow, hm?",
        "LORELAI: Unnecessary.",
        "RORY: Yeah.",
        "CUT TO OUTSIDE",
        "[On Thanksgiving morning, Lorelai and Rory are walking toward the market]",
        "RORY: What's on the list?",
        "LORELAI: Flowers for everyone we're visiting and cranberry sauce for the Kims.",
        "RORY: Tums.",
        "LORELAI: You mean amateur pills?",
        "RORY: Just in case.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, Tums.",
        "RORY: I'll do the flowers.",
        "LORELAI: I'll do Doose's.",
        "RORY: Thank you.",
        "[Lorelai goes into the market. Jess walks up behind Rory]",
        "JESS: Hey there.",
        "RORY: Hey. [he kisses her, but Rory pulls away] Wait, stop.",
        "JESS: What?",
        "RORY: Stop.",
        "JESS: What are you doing?",
        "RORY: Come on. [Rory pulls him down the sidewalk a little, then kisses him]",
        "JESS: What was that?",
        "RORY: That was a kiss.",
        "JESS: What's with the relocation before the kiss?",
        "RORY: It's too early.",
        "JESS: Too early? Too early for what?",
        "RORY: For kissing like that.",
        "JESS: What's the rule, no kissing before noon?",
        "RORY: No, it's too early to do this here.",
        "JESS: Where, in the street?",
        "RORY: In the street, with people watching...",
        "JESS: What people?",
        "RORY: In front of Doose's.",
        "JESS: Ah, Doose's.",
        "RORY: We shouldn't flaunt it.",
        "JESS: But I want to flaunt it.",
        "RORY: It doesn't feel right.",
        "JESS: He's a big boy Rory.",
        "RORY: I know.",
        "JESS: It's not the first time a couple's broken up.",
        "RORY: It is for us.",
        "JESS: This is insane.",
        "RORY: Please, let's not flaunt it, please?",
        "JESS: For how long?",
        "RORY: Until it's comfortable.",
        "JESS: Before we're on Social Security?",
        "RORY: I promise, we can kiss secretly.",
        "JESS: Yeah, or we can wear Three Stooges masks all the time, that way no one will know who we are.",
        "RORY: I can be Curly.",
        "JESS: I'll be Moe.",
        "RORY: Probably too silly.",
        "JESS: Yeah, probably.",
        "RORY: This will get better over time, I promise. But until then, let's just play it cool.",
        "JESS: Hey, I'm Frank at the Sands.",
        "RORY: That's cool.",
        "CUT TO INSIDE DOOSE'S MARKET",
        "[Lorelai is shopping]",
        "LORELAI: Oh, hey, Kirk. Doing your holiday shopping?",
        "KIRK: Well, shopping, yes, and it is a holiday, but my shopping isn't holiday related, so technically no.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, what happened there?",
        "KIRK: Oh, nothing, just a little scratch.",
        "LORELAI: Looks like a big scratch. Wow, Bactine, Neosporin, Mercurochrome \u0096 what's with all the pharmacologicals?",
        "KIRK: Oh, well, Kirk and I are going through a little adjustment period, that's all.",
        "LORELAI: CatKirk?",
