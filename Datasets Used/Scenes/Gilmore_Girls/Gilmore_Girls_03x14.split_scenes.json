        "[Lorelai, Rory, and Emily are eating dinner]",
        "EMILY: And then she just brushed me off with a wave of her regal hand. Not even a word, just a. . .like I'm her cabana boy. Next thing you know, instead of just walking out of the room, she'll make me bow and back out. Imperious attitude, she never gives it a rest. I schlepped her to the doctor the other day \u0096 by command, not request \u0096 and the elevator operator there greeted us nice and friendly. Her doctor's on the second floor and by the time we got there, that operator was in tears.",
        "LORELAI: Whew.",
        "EMILY: What?",
        "LORELAI: Well, Mom, you just did twenty straight minutes on Gran.",
        "EMILY: It wasn't twenty minutes.",
        "RORY: It was getting there.",
        "LORELAI: How about a moratorium on the Gran stories for a bit?",
        "EMILY: Fine. I'd rather not spoil the meal with talk of her.",
        "LORELAI: Good.",
        "EMILY: I should just wash my hands.",
        "LORELAI: Okay.",
        "RORY: We'll wait.",
        "EMILY: I mean of her.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, good, wash those hands.",
        "EMILY: She sucks her olive pits.",
        "LORELAI: Short moratorium.",
        "EMILY: Trying to extract every last ounce of flavor out of them like she does people.",
        "LORELAI: She sucks flavor out of people?",
        "RORY: Can we change the subject?",
        "EMILY: Life, not flavor.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, you know what Gran needs?",
        "EMILY: What?",
        "LORELAI: A fella.",
        "RORY: With or without an umbrella.",
        "EMILY: He'd have to look like an olive pit to get her attention.",
        "LORELAI: It's like a Dean Martin Roast.",
        "RORY: Those are never funny to me.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, they're mean.",
        "RORY: Except for Don Rickles.",
        "LORELAI: Totally except for Rickles.",
        "EMILY: I think she did have a man for a time squiring her around to her biddy affairs. Richard thought so, too, and it horrified him.",
        "LORELAI: Didn't want a new Daddy, huh?",
        "EMILY: And then he seemed suddenly out of the picture.",
        "RORY: So Great Grandma never talked about him?",
        "EMILY: Never. Even though I could tell practically the day she stopped seeing him. Those kinds of things are always obvious.",
        "RORY: Yeah, I guess.",
        "EMILY: When a couple is in a relationship and then suddenly isn't.",
        "RORY: Right.",
        "LORELAI: Right.",
        "RORY: Is she still looking?",
        "LORELAI: Yup.",
        "RORY: Right. Um, you know, Grandma, did I mention that unfortunately I'm not with Dean anymore?",
        "EMILY: No, you didn't.",
        "RORY: Well, I'm not.",
        "EMILY: Well, yes, I've known for weeks actually. But it's good that you confirmed it.",
        "RORY: How did you know?",
        "EMILY: Well, you very abruptly stopped mentioning him eleven dinners ago, so I figured that was the case.",
        "LORELAI: Eleven dinners, you kept count?",
        "EMILY: Eleven.",
        "LORELAI: Eleven.",
        "RORY: Well, I'm sorry I didn't tell you Grandma.",
        "EMILY: Well, I think you should have. I mean, what if I had invited Dean to an event and you were no longer with him, and that's how I found out? It would've been embarrassing.",
        "LORELAI: What sort of event would you have invited Dean to?",
        "EMILY: I don't know, a wedding.",
        "LORELAI: For who?",
        "EMILY: A mutual friend or something.",
        "LORELAI: You and Dean have mutual friends in common that Rory and I don't? Who would that be, the Talbotts or that senior partner at Deloite and Touche?",
        "EMILY: You know what I meant. It's always best to tell each other major life events so that there's no awkwardness.",
        "RORY: Well, then, Grandma, I probably also failed to mention that I'm seeing someone else.",
        "EMILY: Who?",
        "RORY: Jess.",
        "EMILY: Jess?",
        "LORELAI: Luke's nephew. Luke from the diner.",
        "EMILY: Oh, I see. Well, am I going to get to meet him soon?",
        "RORY: Oh, I don't know.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, Mom, that might be hard to arrange.",
        "EMILY: Well, how hard can it be? Just bring him over for dinner sometime. How about next Friday?",
        "RORY: Oh, I don't know.",
        "LORELAI: Uh, yeah, Mom, that might be hard to arrange.",
        "EMILY: It's perfect timing. Richard will still be out of town and it would be nice to round off the group with a fourth.",
        "LORELAI: He works Fridays, doesn't he?",
        "RORY: Yeah, that's his usual night. Friday night. It's a bad night.",
        "EMILY: Oh, okay. Well, I suppose I'll eventually meet him someday at some function.",
        "LORELAI: Perhaps a wedding.",
        "EMILY: Or Rory's graduation. That's good. That way we'll all get to meet him at once. Myself, Richard, Gran. Maybe I'll bring a couple of girls from the DAR. Reverend Mahoney might like to come also.",
        "RORY: You know what, Grandma, now that I think about it, I think Jess does have next Friday night off.",
        "EMILY: Really?",
        "RORY: Let's make it a foursome.",
        "EMILY: That'll be nice.",
        "RORY: Yeah, it will be nice, right Grandma?",
        "EMILY: Very nice. We'll have lamb.",
        "RORY: So, it will be nice for everybody? Everybody will be nice to everybody? The key word being nice.",
        "EMILY: Yes, very nice.",
        "RORY: Really, really nice?",
        "EMILY: Of course it'll be nice. That's what I just said.",
        "RORY: Good. Nice would be nice.",
        "EMILY: And a nice night it'll be.",
        "LORELAI: Well, not so nice for the lamb.",

        "CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at the kitchen table]",
        "LORELAI: Okay, Saturday morning I've got hair appointment, nails, and Jim.",
        "RORY: You don't go to the gym.",
        "LORELAI: No, Jim is coming here to fix the garbage disposal.",
        "RORY: Jim Dunning, got it.",
        "LORELAI: I also have resha plebisham.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: I don't know, I can't read it.",
        "RORY: Shouldn't you change your system, go electronic or something? You're a busy woman.",
        "LORELAI: Uh, hey, my system works.",
        "RORY: Yeah, tell that to the guy who calls tomorrow because you missed your resha plebisham appointment.",
        "LORELAI: I hate that we have to coordinate schedules. You're my daughter.",
        "RORY: But if we don't, we may never see each other.",
        "LORELAI: We didn't use to have to do this.",
        "RORY: Well, we're busier now.",
        "LORELAI: Let's just run away together and leave all this behind.",
        "RORY: You mean our house?",
        "LORELAI: No, we'll take the house, we'll leave everything else.",
        "RORY: Put it on your list.",
        "LORELAI: So what's your day like tomorrow?",
        "RORY: Hanging out with Jess for most of the day, studying at night.",
        "LORELAI: Cool. Alex and I are having dinner tomorrow night.",
        "RORY: Good. That'll make it nice and quiet for when I study.",
        "LORELAI: I'm that loud?",
        "RORY: You are when you dance around singing \u0091Rory's Studying' songs.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, what's this I have down for Sunday \u0096 slatha bang trafficking?",
        "RORY: Lane's band practicing.",
        "LORELAI: And underneath it \u0096 net fracks?",
        "RORY: Get snacks.",
        "LORELAI: Right \u0096 for the band. See, see, it works. So, uh, you're actually bringing Jess to dinner on Friday?",
        "RORY: It's as good a time as any. There'll only be one grandparent to contend with.",
        "LORELAI: Man, that was some stealthy little maneuver she pulled there, huh? Applying the guilt over not knowing about the Dean breakup and making you all weak, and then using that to get Jess to come to dinner on Friday. She's like Lyndon Johnson with the Senate, effortless.",
        "RORY: So, Sunday's for us, right?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I have you down right here \u0096 Cokie.",
        "RORY: Good. Hey, it's still early. Do you wanna watch more of the extra supplementary stuff on the Lord of the Rings DVD?",
        "LORELAI: Well, it's just the drawings and that fat guy talking.",
        "RORY: Well, let's watch Footloose again.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah.",
        "RORY: Hey, you dropped some of your notes.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, who cares? You can't read them anyway.",
        "CUT TO TOWN SQUARE",
        "[Rory and Jess are sitting on a bench looking at a book]",
        "RORY: Do you love it?",
        "JESS: It's great.",
        "RORY: The Holy Barbarians. I mean, what a title. And it's by a Venice Beach beatnik about Venice Beach beatniks, and to top it off, the beatnik who wrote it is the father of the guy that does those Actor's Studio interviews on TV.",
        "JESS: The guy with the beard?",
        "RORY: Yeah, the pointy beard. That's his dad writing at his desk.",
        "JESS: Oh, it's weird that a weird beatnik-y guy would have a conservative son like that.",
        "RORY: Maybe he's not that conservative. Maybe at night, he, like, takes off his clothes and parties.",
        "JESS: Aw, man, now get that picture out of my head.",
        "RORY: It's a cool book, you've gotta admit.",
        "JESS: It is. Thanks.",
        "RORY: Oh, I'm not lending it. I'm not done.",
        "JESS: Well, why'd you show it to me?",
        "RORY: I like showing you the stuff I'm reading.",
        "JESS: But you knew I'd wanna read it. You're a book tease.",
        "RORY: You'll get it when I'm done.",
        "JESS: Cruel woman.",
        "RORY: So, are you going to work now?",
        "JESS: Back to the salt mines.",
        "RORY: So, you're not tied to the hours you have, right? You can trade if you want to.",
        "JESS: There's some flexibility.",
        "RORY: You got any flexibility next Friday night?",
        "JESS: Yeah, why?",
        "RORY: I thought maybe you could come to dinner with us.",
        "JESS: Us?",
        "RORY: To my Grandma's.",
        "JESS: To meet your grandmother.",
        "RORY: Yeah, she'll be there, so yeah, it might be rude not to introduce the two of you.",
        "JESS: I can't, I gotta work.",
        "RORY: You just said you could get out.",
        "JESS: I didn't know what for.",
        "RORY: Jess.",
        "JESS: No.",
        "RORY: But I already kind of agreed.",
        "JESS: Aw, man.",
        "RORY: So I'm kinda jammed here.",
        "JESS: Does she know what I look like?",
        "RORY: I don't think so.",
        "JESS: Perfect. Find someone who vaguely resembles me. Take him. Just don't kiss him goodnight.",
        "RORY: That's not going to work.",
        "JESS: Andy Warhol did it all the time. [Rory gives him the book] We're just five bucks away from a deal.",
        "RORY: [kisses him] That's worth five at least.",
        "JESS: You Gilmores think a lot of yourselves. Okay.",
        "RORY: Thank you, thank you, thank you.",
        "JESS: Manipulator.",
        "[They both walk away in opposite directions. Rory walks past the dance studio as Miss Patty walks out]",
        "MISS PATTY: Rory, get in here.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "MISS PATTY: Get in here now. No questions.",
        "RORY: Okay.",
        "[they walk into the dance studio. Rory sits down next to Dean.]",
        "MISS PATTY: Okay, now, for those who just arrived, I'm trying out some material for my one-woman show and I need some feedback. You are my randomly picked audience.",
        "DEAN: Randomly shang-hai'ed.",
        "MISS PATTY: It's part stories, part songs. Kind of like what Elaine Stritch did on Broadway, but without the bitterness. My working title \u0096 \"Buckle Up, I'm Patty.\"",
        "RORY: How long have you been here?",
        "DEAN: An hour.",
        "RORY: Poor thing.",
        "DEAN: It's been mostly her and Kirk arguing about stuff. Apparently, he's the director.",
        "KIRK: Patty, let's try one of your reminisces.",
        "MISS PATTY: That's what I'm looking for, Kirk.",
        "DEAN: Sorry I didn't save you. I didn't see you until it was too late.",
        "RORY: I don't think anybody could've saved me.",
        "MISS PATTY: Okay, here we go. Hey, did you know that I once met the great Bette Davis? I was a chorus girl in a bus-and-truck tour of \"Guys and Dolls.\" Beantown, I love that town. And there I was, me and the girls backstage after the show, and in she comes. And who does she walk right up to, but little old me. And she sized me up, exhaled some smoke from that regal mouth of hers, and said, \"Doll, you don't got the high notes but you sure got the gams.\" I'll always treasure that moment with Bette and I wanna dedicate this song to her. Uh, Ethel, key a D.",
        "KIRK: We're gonna have to rewrite that.",
        "MISS PATTY: What?",
        "KIRK: It got no response. It needs a rewrite.",
        "MISS PATTY: Kirk, it's my reminiscence. I can't rewrite it.",
        "KIRK: How about if she says, \"Doll, you've got the gams, but I've got a body in the trunk of my car.\"",
        "MISS PATTY: Why would she say that?",
        "KIRK: Because she's a murderer. I think it works.",
        "MISS PATTY: I'm not rewriting my memories, Kirk.",
        "KIRK: It died. Build a coffin for it, put some pennies on its eyes \u0091cause that stiff ain't breathing.",
        "MISS PATTY: Well, I think that we should discuss this later, now go back to your light booth.",
        "KIRK: Fine, start the song.",
        "MISS PATTY: [sings] It's a quarter of three, there is no one in the place, except you and me. [strobe light starts flashing] Kirk, would you fix this?",
        "KIRK: Fix what?",
        "MISS PATTY: This flashing.",
        "KIRK: That's my choice for the song.",
        "MISS PATTY: It's disco.",
        "KIRK: I'm trying to subvert expectations.",
        "MISS PATTY: Well, don't. Just give me a simple spot.",
        "KIRK: Something more obvious, got it.",
        "RORY: This is a hit.",
        "DEAN: It'll run for years.",
        "KIRK: Something on the nose and expected, got it.",
        "MISS PATTY: Kirk!",
        "CUT TO OUTSIDE",
        "[Later that night, Rory and Dean walk out of the dance studio]",
        "RORY: It was nice of you to step in like that.",
        "DEAN: Well, she could've hurt herself trying to throw the podium at him like that.",
        "RORY: I think \"work in progress\" is the key phrase.",
        "DEAN: I like that she tries.",
        "RORY: The woman taught me everything I've already forgotten about dancing, baton twirling and gymnastics.",
        "DEAN: Well, I'm this way.",
        "RORY: I'm this way.",
        "DEAN: See you later.",
        "RORY: See ya.",
        "DEAN: You know, I kind of liked the body in the trunk thing.",
        "RORY: Me, too. Peppier.",
        "DEAN: Night.",
        "RORY: Night.",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "[Rory is studying on the couch when she hears a noise outside. She walks to the door and opens it. Lorelai and Alex are kissing on the front porch]",
        "RORY: Oh, sorry.",
        "LORELAI: It's okay.",
        "ALEX: It's okay.",
        "RORY: I can just shut the door so you can carry on.",
        "ALEX: No, we've carried on enough.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, I think we've carried on pretty good out here. I'll call you about the weekend.",
        "ALEX: Okay.",
        "LORELAI: Bye.",
        "ALEX: Bye. Bye Rory.",
        "RORY: Goodnight.",
        "[Alex leaves. Lorelai walks into the house]",
        "RORY: We need a signal.",
        "LORELAI: A kissing signal?",
        "RORY: Something to avoid this.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, um, how \u0091bout I shoot off a flare when I'm outside necking with a boy?",
        "RORY: You know what I mean.",
        "LORELAI: Or I could bang on the door and yell, \"Hey, we're necking out here!\"",
        "RORY: I still say we need a signal.",
        "LORELAI: We'll think of something. Hey, listen. Alex and I were talking about going to New York next weekend.",
        "RORY: Fun.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah. He's got four tickets to a show and he's heard me talk about Sookie and Jackson so much that he wants to invite them, too.",
        "RORY: It's not \"Buckle Up, I'm Patty,\" is it?",
        "LORELAI: Huh?",
        "RORY: Nothing.",
        "LORELAI: We'd have to leave Friday day.",
        "RORY: So?",
        "LORELAI: Meaning it's just you and Jess alone at dinner with the glorious Emily.",
        "RORY: Oh, that's totally fine.",
        "LORELAI: Are you sure?",
        "RORY: Yeah, it might even make things easier.",
        "LORELAI: What does that mean?",
        "RORY: Nothing. Just, it might make it less pressure-packed.",
        "LORELAI: So I'm loud when you study and make social gatherings worse?",
        "RORY: Out of the goodness of your heart, you would be trying to shield me all night, and that might makes things worse. Out of love. And I love you, I hope you know that.",
        "[phone rings]",
        "LORELAI: Okay, I think I get it. I have the best intentions.",
        "RORY: Bingo. [answers phone] Hello?",
        "JESS: Hey.",
        "RORY: Hey. How was work?",
        "JESS: I toted the barge, lifted the bale.",
        "RORY: Well, you're a great barge toter, I can attest to that.",
        "JESS: How was your day?",
        "RORY: Fine. A lot of studying.",
        "JESS: Oh yeah? Is that all you did?",
        "RORY: Yeah, basically.",
        "JESS: Basically?",
        "RORY: Jess, what?",
        "JESS: I heard that you were basically hanging out with Dean today.",
        "RORY: Where did you hear that?",
        "JESS: It's all over town.",
        "RORY: Well, I was with him for awhile. What do you mean, it's all over town?",
        "JESS: You haven't seen the fliers?",
        "RORY: I've been home all night. What fliers?",
        "JESS: It says, \"People are already raving about Miss Patty's one woman show.\"",
        "RORY: And?",
        "JESS: There's some blurbs. One says, \"Rory and Dean couldn't stop talking about it.\"",
        "RORY: We're on a flier?",
        "JESS: You and a bunch of others. \"The mailman says, even without proper postage, this show delivers.\"",
        "RORY: Well, now she's making that up \u0091cause Ralph's not that witty.",
        "JESS: Were you hanging out there with Dean?",
        "RORY: I was not hanging out with Dean. We were both hauled in there to watch her try out material and we were sitting in the same area so we talked a little, and then we left at the same time. That was it. It was all by accident.",
        "JESS: Yeah?",
        "RORY: This is an old subject, Jess. You know that Dean and I are friendly.",
        "JESS: I know you're friendly. That doesn't mean I don't wanna punch him.",
        "RORY: This was not a plan. I was kidnapped by Miss Patty, so was he, that's it.",
        "JESS: Then you two should press charges.",
        "RORY: I think we should.",
        "JESS: Just \u0096",
        "RORY: What?",
        "JESS: Just tell me these things first so I don't have to read about them on telephone poles.",
        "RORY: I will, I promise.",
        "JESS: Okay.",
        "RORY: Okay.",
        "JESS: So, how was the show?",
        "RORY: It's gonna need a lot of postage.",
        "JESS: Why does it say, \"Not in any way affiliated with Kirk\" down at the bottom?",
        "RORY: Oh, they had a showbiz spat.",
        "JESS: Fill me in.",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S KITCHEN",
        "[Lorelai gets out snacks for the band, who are sitting at the table]",
        "LORELAI: Help yourselves to drinks in the fridge, guys. We've got chips, pretzels, and Brian, I remembered your allergies and got you the melba toast.",
        "BRIAN: That's nice, thanks.",
        "DAVE: We got a lot done today.",
        "LANE: We've almost got a full set.",
        "ZACH: But you know what we're missing? A straight-ahead love song.",
        "BRIAN: Yeah, all our songs are pretty much about property destruction and a general dislike of right-wing causes.",
        "LORELAI: Not one love song, huh?",
        "DAVE: I think we can add one or two, that are good ones.",
        "LORELAI: Boy, you'd think love songs are all you and Lane would wanna play.",
        "ZACH: Man, this crunch just now sounded like the drum-fill in Baba O'Reilly.",
        "LANE: Cool, way to go Zach.",
        "DAVE: Yeah, Zach, a musical mouth. That's awesome.",
        "ZACH: But why would Dave and Lane wanna play just love songs?",
        "LORELAI: Because, I was just thinking, you know, with Dave's name \u0096 Dave \u0096 you've got the last two letters in love. V, E. And with Lane's name, you have the L. You can just dump the A and add an O and there you go.",
        "ZACH: Makes sense.",
        "BRIAN: Totally. We should probably start breaking stuff down. I gotta get home for dinner.",
        "ZACH: One day soon, you're not gonna go home from dinner.",
        "BRIAN: What, I'll be dead?",
        "ZACH: No, we'll be on tour.",
        "BRIAN: Right, right.",
        "ZACH: That was a negative \"right, right,\" man.",
        "[Zach and Brian go outside]",
        "LORELAI: Guys, I'm so sorry. It just slipped out.",
        "LANE: That's okay.",
        "DAVE: Luckily Zach and Brian are. . .well, Zach and Brian.",
        "LORELAI: How long are you gonna keep it a secret?",
        "LANE: For awhile, at least. It's easier.",
        "LORELAI: Are you sure it would be so bad if they knew? I mean, keeping this a secret seems awfully complicated.",
        "LANE: Not really, we've got a system.",
        "DAVE: Um, speaking of which, it's 3:18. We'll have the stuff packed by 3:40, what's the situation?",
        "LANE: At 3:40, my mom will be on her way to the yarn store for her bimonthly sew-a-thon with Lacey Schwartz and Bick Ho.",
        "DAVE: The yarn store's on Peach.",
        "LANE: Plum.",
        "DAVE: That cuts us off from our usually route to the interstate.",
        "LANE: There's a back road that circles around it, but it's gonna be muddy from the rains.",
        "DAVE: How about I have the guys take the usual route, I'll go by foot on Peach, down the alley behind Al's, over the fence, and they can pick me up a half a mile down by the Shell station.",
        "LANE: Perfect. Uh, what, that's not complicated.",
        "LORELAI: Sorry I doubted you.",
        "LANE: Well, okay, then.",

        "[Lorelai walks in]",
        "LORELAI: Hey.",
        "LUKE: Hey. Coffee?",
        "LORELAI: Please, and hurry. I am going to Manhattan this weekend and I need to shop for some warm clothes.",
        "LUKE: You already have warm clothes.",
        "LORELAI: I have nothing.",
        "LUKE: We're in Connecticut. It gets freezing here same as in New York.",
        "LORELAI: No, it's not the same.",
        "LUKE: Exactly the same.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I have nothing stylish enough.",
        "LUKE: That's not true, you got the black cashmere coat.",
        "LORELAI: But it needs cleaning.",
        "LUKE: So clean it.",
        "LORELAI: But I need some sweaters, too.",
        "LUKE: You've got the purple, you've got the powder blue, you've got three shades of red, you've got a ton of black, all of which will go with that coat. Plus, you've got a dozen scarves to mix and match with any of those tops.",
        "LORELAI: Let me shop for some clothes.",
        "LUKE: Okay. So what are you doing in New York?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, a bunch of us are going. It'll be dinner and a show.",
        "LUKE: Oh, what show?",
        "LORELAI: Levittown, it's a new musical.",
        "LUKE: Right, yeah. It's in previews, doesn't officially open for a couple weeks.",
        "LORELAI: Wow, so informed.",
        "LUKE: Nicole likes the theater. Her firm has an office on Madison. I've met her there a couple times. Saw Hairspray last week.",
        "LORELAI: I cannot picture you watching Hairspray.",
        "LUKE: It was okay. I liked The Producers better.",
        "LORELAI: Well, aren't we just a Broadway baby.",
        "LUKE: Gonna have any time to kill there?",
        "LORELAI: Some.",
        "LUKE: Got a great book, it has walking tours of old historic Manhattan. You know, before Disney got a hold of it. The Soho one's pretty good.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, I love stuff like that.",
        "LUKE: It's upstairs on my dresser if you wanna run up and grab it.",
        "LORELAI: Cool, thanks.",
        "[Cut to upstairs. Lorelai walks into Luke's apartment and finds Rory and Jess kissing on the couch]",
        "LORELAI: Oh, oh!",
        "RORY: Mom!",
        "LORELAI: Surprise.",
        "RORY: What are you doing here?",
        "LORELAI: I came up for a book.",
        "JESS: A book?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah.",
        "JESS: Got a lot of books here. Anything in particular?",
        "LORELAI: It's one of Luke's.",
        "JESS: Well, if it doesn't have Encyclopedia Brown in the title, that narrows it down a lot.",
        "LORELAI: Walking tours, New York.",
        "JESS: On the table. [hands her the book]",
        "LORELAI: Good, here it is, okay, so, thanks. Sorry about this.",
        "RORY: It's okay.",
        "LORELAI: We should probably come up with a system or something.",
        "RORY: Probably.",
        "LORELAI: D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, huh?",
        "RORY: D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.",
        "LORELAI: Although, why I'd be walking into Luke's apartment like this in the future, I don't know, so put the system on the back burner.",
        "JESS: Okay.",
        "LORELAI: Mmkay. Carry on, or. . .see ya.",
        "[Lorelai walks back down to the diner]",
        "LORELAI: Dude!",
        "LUKE: Hey. Find it okay?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah. I found everything -- including a couple coupling.",
        "LUKE: Oh, Rory and Jess?",
        "LORELAI: No, Ben and J. Lo. Yes, Rory and Jess.",
        "LUKE: I guess I should've told you.",
        "LORELAI: You knew they were up there?",
        "LUKE: They're up there all the time.",
        "LORELAI: On the couch. . .horizontal, on the couch?",
        "LUKE: They come up for air every so often.",
        "LORELAI: And you just allow this? Luke!",
        "LUKE: Settle down. I go up there every ten minutes pretending to get something to keep them from doing something we don't want. \"Oops, I forgot my pocketknife.\" \"Oops, uh, I'm out of ones.\" \"Uh, hey, you see a case of mustard up here?\" I put the stuff in a box. I take the box upstairs every couple days and start all over again.",
        "LORELAI: And you think that suffices?",
        "LUKE: Look, it's better that they're safe and upstairs than someplace else. And you going up there just now saved me a trip, so thanks.",
        "LORELAI: Glad to be of service.",
        "LUKE: I got a good system, it works.",
        "LORELAI: Every ten minutes?",
        "LUKE: Like clockwork, never a minute more.",
        "LORELAI: Even if you're serving a customer, it's every ten minutes?",
        "LUKE: If I'm in mid-pour, I stop and go up.",
        "LORELAI: Ten minutes. Yeah, that's pretty much the time it took to create Rory. And that included getting dressed and freshening my lipstick.",
        "LUKE: What?",
        "LORELAI: Thanks for the book.",
        "LUKE: Caesar, cover for me.",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE",

        "LORELAI: [from upstairs] Rory?",
        "RORY: I'm coming.",
        "LORELAI: Toute de suite, and I don't mean the candy.",
        "[Rory walks into Lorelai's bedroom]",
        "RORY: Okay, what's the packing crisis?",
        "LORELAI: That's the thing. I have no packing crisis. For the first time in my life, there is no packing crisis. See? This has never happened to me before. I'm all packed, ready to go, and fully confident that I have everything I'll need or desire.",
        "RORY: So you're creating a crisis out of nostalgia?",
        "LORELAI: No, see, Alex and I talked about everything we plan to do and how he expected to dress and how I expected to dress, and we coordinated to the point where I knew each piece of clothing I had to bring, down to the Spice Girls necklace I plan to wear Saturday morning for breakfast because we agreed to keep it a little whimsical.",
        "RORY: So, not your Jonas Salk necklace?",
        "LORELAI: I'm trying to become as good a planner as you.",
        "RORY: So, what's the problem?",
        "LORELAI: I have no idea what to wear on the drive. I wanna look good, obviously, but not too good that it steps on my night outfit, and I also wanna be comfortable.",
        "RORY: What's he wearing, a jogging suit?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, and then after, he and Paulie are hitting the Bada Bing.",
        "RORY: Your point being, it's probably not a running suit.",
        "LORELAI: Right.",
        "RORY: And tonight's a dress?",
        "LORELAI: And, uh, my cashmere coat and a hat.",
        "RORY: Your stretchy jeans and your Bunnyranch T-shirt.",
        "LORELAI: Comfort and raunch, I love it. Good. So, um, how are you guys working the logistics tonight?",
        "RORY: I am going to study at school, then I'm going straight to Grandma's from there. Jess is driving straight from work, and then he's driving me home.",
        "LORELAI: Home? Home here?",
        "RORY: Yeah, he's gonna drop me off here.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I guess that makes sense.",
        "RORY: I thought so.",
        "LORELAI: Although, hm, I don't know.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: Are you sure that's the best way to do it?",
        "RORY: Yeah, why?",
        "LORELAI: Well, it just means you're coming home to an empty house.",
        "RORY: Well, that's your doing, not mine.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, but it might be kind of lonely here. Did you think about staying at Mom's?",
        "RORY: Overnight?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah. They've got those fancy beds that don't sag, and you're guaranteed a great Norma Desmond style breakfast the next morning. You don't have school, it works out perfectly.",
        "RORY: I'd rather just come home.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, sure. But, you know, staying at your grandmother's would also mean that Jess wouldn't have to go out of his way at the end of the night to drop you off. It would be much more convenient for him.",
        "RORY: Our house is two-tenths of a mile out of his way.",
        "LORELAI: Are you sure he's gonna have enough gas?",
        "RORY: I'll make sure.",
        "LORELAI: But if you can't get a hold of him, it might be safer to plan on staying at Mom's. I mean, if you run out of gas, you're stuck. And at the mercy of the Orcs.",
        "RORY: Mom, why are you so freaked?",
        "LORELAI: This is not freaked.",
        "RORY: Is it because you won't be here and he will?",
        "LORELAI: Uh, it might've crossed my mind.",
        "RORY: And what are you worried about happening?",
        "LORELAI: Well, what you guys were on the on-ramp for up at Luke's the other day. Your basic boy/girl stuff. Especially with this new boy, you girl stuff.",
        "RORY: Well, the boy is different, but I'm still me. That hasn't changed.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, I know.",
        "RORY: And I have so much on my mind, so many things going on in my life, that I don't ever have time to think about that.",
        "LORELAI: No thinking at all?",
        "RORY: None, I swear.",
        "LORELAI: Mmhmm, sure, sure.",
        "RORY: And we talk about everything together, you and me, remember? So it's not like something will happen that you won't know about.",

        "EMILY: But you look darling in it. I'm going to miss it when you go to college.",
        "RORY: Yeah, I am, too, in a way. I mean, I like not having to think about what I'm going to wear.",

        "RORY: I know how you like things to be punctual.",
        "EMILY: There was a big tie-up on the 84 earlier. He's probably smack dab in the middle of that. Why don't you try him on his cell phone, see what's going on.",

        "EMILY: Really?",
        "RORY: He doesn't believe in them.",
        "EMILY: Well, I find that refreshing. Technology is encroaching too fast on every aspect of life, if you ask me. It's getting to the point where people will want robots to carry them from place to place. [the doorbell rings] There he is.",

        "JESS: No, 84 was jammed.",
        "EMILY: We knew that, too. There was something with a big rig. Oh, those things, they scare the life out of me. And apparently, all the men who drive them are hopped up on bennies and goofballs. Come, come, have a seat at the table. I'll go check on dinner. [walks away]",

        "JESS: It's why we have teeth.",
        "EMILY: That's how I feel. Dinner parties used to be simple. Now every time we give one, I have to run my menu down with every person on the list. It's tiring. This one eats just about anything.",

        "EMILY: I'm sorry, but the way you and your mother eat, and those slim figures of yours \u0096 it's a medical marvel.",
