She gets a call from Sookie who tells her that Lorelai is in bad shape after Luke told her that he didn't think he could be in this relationship. Rory doesn't have a car, but Logan lets her borrow his car and driver. Taylor has the whole town taking sides for either Luke or Lorelai.

        "CHRIS: I just want to talk.",
        "LORELAI: Get some coffee, Christopher!",
        "CHRIS: This wasn't the way I wanted it to go down. I wanted to get you alone and - what are you doing?",
        "LORELAI: I'm going after Luke!",
        "MARILYN: Oh, there you are! [Calling to Emily] I've got her! [She pulls Lorelai toward the cake.] Oh, you cannot keep a room full of Anglo-Saxons waiting for cake this long! They start to form more clubs. [To the photographer] Take her, take her, take her!",
        "PHOTOGRAPHER: All right, wonderful. There we are. [The four of them are lined up - Rory, Richard, Emily and Lorelai.] Okay. Everyone, in just a little closer. That's perfect, hold that.",
        "LORELAI [leaning into to whisper in Emily's ear]: You and me, we're done.",

        "LORELAI: Party's over. It is so over.",
        "RORY: Are you okay?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah. I'm fine. It's just time to go.",
        "RORY: Are we okay? I mean, that wasn't exactly my proudest moment.",
        "LORELAI: Aw, honey. You're the daughter of a woman who has had no end of less than proud moments. Don't worry.",
        "RORY: Luke was so mad.",
        "LORELAI: That's because to Luke you're still ten years old wearing feathered angel's wings going door-to-door inviting people to a caterpillar's funeral.",
        "RORY: Oh, now, I did that once.",
        "LORELAI: Luke is fine.",
        "RORY: I hope so.",
        "LORELAI: Look, go back in. Catch up with Logan. Tell him everything is fine.",
        "RORY: He went right to his car, he split.",
        "LORELAI: I don't blame the boy.",
        "RORY: And what's with you and Grandma?",
        "LORELAI: All these questions!",
        "RORY: Sorry.",
        "LORELAI: Look. Go back in, huh? Make the best of things. Luke is just, um, bringing the car around. I'll talk to you later.",
        "RORY: Are you sure we're good?",
        "LORELAI: Always.",

        "LORELAI: Hi.",
        "CAESAR: I was just on my break.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, that's no problem. Caesar, listen -",
        "CAESAR: I clocked out too, so it should say so on my time card.",
        "LORELAI: Right.",
        "CAESAR: Although the ink is kinda weak and faded. It's really hard to see.",
        "LORELAI: That's fine. Great. Caesar, is Luke back yet?",
        "CAESAR: Didn't you guys go somewhere tonight?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah.",
        "CAESAR: Did you get separated or something?",
        "LORELAI: Something like that. So have you seen him?",
        "CAESAR: Not unless I fell asleep. And I never fall asleep.",
        "LORELAI: Well, so if you didn't fall asleep you know for a fact he's not back.",
        "CAESAR: Right. So you didn't come back together, huh?",
        "LORELAI: Long story. Getting kinda late, so -",
        "CAESAR: If I see him, should I tell him to call you?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, please.",
        "CAESAR: Okay. And, if you talk to him, could you maybe not mention the radio, or eating the pie? He hates when I eat out of the pie plate.",
        "LORELAI: You were eating out of the pie plate?",
        "CAESAR [hesitates]: No. No.",
        "LORELAI: Well, thanks, Caesar. See ya.",
        "CAESAR: I've got lots of work to do, and I'm hankering to get to it.",

        "LORELAI: Hi! Babette! Hey, Morey.",
        "MOREY: Hey, Lorelai.",
        "BABETTE: Look at you all dolled up and walking the street. I'm not calling you a hooker or nothing.",
        "LORELAI: Well, thank you. Hey, um, did you guys pass Luke, or see his truck any time tonight?",
        "MOREY: Uh-oh.",
        "BABETTE: You're not with Luke?",
        "LORELAI: Not at the moment.",
        "BABETTE: Uh-oh.",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "BABETTE: Didn't you go to your parents' wedding thing tonight?",
        "LORELAI: Yes.",
        "MOREY: Uh-oh.",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "BABETTE: You didn't come back together?",
        "LORELAI: Well, of course we did. We're just not together at the moment.",
        "BABETTE and MOREY: Uh-oh.",
        "LORELAI: Would you guys stop doing that?",
        "BABETTE: Everything's all right between the two of you, isn't it?",
        "LORELAI: Of course it is.",
        "BABETTE: I hope so.",
        "MOREY: Otherwise Taylor would go crazy.",
        "BABETTE: He's got all these contingency plans, remember, in case you guys split? He's worried what it would do to the town. Big a**l creep.",
        "LORELAI: Well, there's no splitting happening here. Everything's fine.",
        "MOREY: Good.",
        "BABETTE: Well, we'd better be going. Take care, doll.",
        "LORELAI: Talk to you guys later. Bye. [They walk away. She takes out her cell phone and dials a number.] Luke, it's, uh, me. Again. Uh, well, another very exciting night comes to a close, huh? Um, I don't think you're home, so I'm going home. Um, I'll leave my cell phone on, or call me at home. Anytime you want. 'Kay. Bye. Er - just please, call me, okay? 'Bye. [She hangs up, and looks back into the diner. Caesar is dancing to the radio.]",

        "PARIS [asleep]: Wha?",
        "RORY: Are you asleep?",
        "PARIS [mumbles]: Don't turn the light on. [Rory turns the light on.] Aah! I said don't turn the light on!",
        "RORY: I didn't hear the 'don't'.",
        "PARIS: Why do you think I would tell you to turn on the light when I'm dead asleep?",
        "RORY: I didn't know you were dead asleep.",
        "PARIS: The room is dark. I'm under the covers and completely immobile. Deduce, Sherlock.",
        "RORY: Well, you're awake now. Can I ask you a question?",
        "PARIS: Bite me.",
        "RORY: Were there any messages for me?",
        "PARIS: Yes. Four other people called and asked that you bite me.",
        "RORY [sighs]: Look, I'm serious here. Come on, Paris. It is especially important tonight that, if there was a message for me, that that message gets to me.",
        "PARIS: If there was a message, I would have left it on the message board.",
        "RORY: The board is blank. And you are not the most reliable message leaver.",
        "PARIS: No messages.",
        "RORY: Okay. I don't mean to insult you, but are you maybe telling me there's no message because you're mad that I woke you and there really was a message?",
        "PARIS [sits up]: Oh, my God, you're annoying tonight! [She notices Rory's suit.] What's with being all k.d.lang?",
        "RORY: It was for my grandparents' vow renewal. I was the best man.",
        "PARIS: Is that kinky or something?",
        "RORY: It was a cute thing.",
        "PARIS: So, who's the boy?",
        "RORY: What boy?",
        "PARIS: The boy you're dying to get a message from. I assume it's a boy.",
        "RORY: Not necessarily.",
        "PARIS: Well, no one called, left a note, smoke signaled, Morse coded, semaphore flagged or came by. Male, female or hermaphrodite. [She flops back into her bed.]",
        "RORY: Okay, thanks.",
        "PARIS [getting up]: I'm wide awake. It's your fault. You owe me Boggle.",

        "[Lorelai walks along. She stops to stare at Kirk playing a dancing game in the video arcade. Kirk finishes his dance and wipes his face with a towel.]",
        "KIRK: Hey, Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: Kirk, you're dripping wet.",
        "KIRK: Sweat is the curse of the b-boy. Mos Def. So, are you feeling better?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah. I'm feeling fine, why?",
        "KIRK: Luke told me you weren't feeling well.",
        "LORELAI: Luke? You've seen Luke?",
        "KIRK: He came into the movie theater. I'm on my break, so I figured I'd come down and bust a sweet move.",
        "LORELAI: When, when?",
        "KIRK: Oh, about a half hour ago. [He hands her the towel.] I asked about you and he said you weren't feeling well. Then he rejected my 'buy two Junior Mints, get a free hunk of onion beef jerky' offer with a disgusting profanity, then took a seat.",
        "LORELAI: So, he's there now?",
        "KIRK: Probably. Nothing's up with you two, is there? I mean, you seem just fine.",
        "LORELAI: No, nothing. Nothing's wrong at all.",
        "KIRK: Uh-oh.",
        "LORELAI: Kirk, we have not broken up.",
        "KIRK: Well, why are you guys dressed up but not together? Luke's in a suit, which seems awfully formal for a movie theater that recycles its popcorn -",
        "LORELAI: Oh, well, we had a fancy event to go to, um, then I got the sniffles, and so Luke decided to see a movie, but now I'm feeling better, so I came looking for him.",
        "KIRK: I hope that's true, 'cause Taylor would go nuts if you two broke up.",
        "LORELAI: Well, that is not the case, so there's nothing to worry about. Do you think he's still there?",
        "KIRK: The movie just started when I left.",
        "LORELAI: Great. Thanks a lot, Kirk. So I can go in without paying?",
        "KIRK: No!",
        "LORELAI: Thank you. [She hurries away.]",

        "LORELAI: What are you watching?",
        "LUKE: Something stupid.",
        "[They watch the movie for a minute.]",
        "LORELAI: Man. They sure talked fast in these things.",
        "LUKE: Yep, they, uh, they did. Fast.",
        "LORELAI: I have been frantically trying to call your cell phone.",
        "LUKE: I turned it off.",
        "LORELAI: That's what I figured. [Pause] So do you want to hear my explanations, 'cause I've got 'em. Explanations, perspective, apologies, I've got 'em all, and I'm dying to share them with you.",
        "LUKE: I just need some time.",
        "LORELAI: Time -",
        "LUKE: A little time, to think.",
        "LORELAI: And to process.",
        "LUKE [nodding]: Right.",
        "LORELAI: I get that. I get that. I just have so much I want to say to you.",
        "LUKE: Not right now. I need to clear my head.",
        "LORELAI: You'll call me when you're ready?",
        "LUKE: Yeah.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. Good. Okay. So, I should - [She gestures toward the door and gets up. Luke ignores her. She stops to look at him before she leaves.]",

        "[Lorelai is showing a guest around.]",
        "LORELAI: - Figure as your little girls arrive, we'll have them here in the living room. We'll have the pocket doors to the dining room closed. Then, when it's time for breakfast, we'll open the doors, and voila, the full, beautiful effect.",
        "WOMAN: Wonderful.",
        "LORELAI: We'll have music with a nice little fanfare. You like Yanni?",
        "WOMAN: Hate him with every fiber of my being.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, good, we're in perfect sync. And then, we'll have small-scale tables set with china, a silver tea service, little plates, little cups, and twelve little chairs for all of them to sit on.",
        "WOMAN: That's so cute.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah.",
        "MICHEL: Wait, twelve? I thought there were six. Six little girls.",
        "LORELAI: Six girls and their six dolls.",
        "MICHEL: I beg your pardon?",
        "LORELAI: This is a pancake breakfast for the girls and their dolls.",
        "MICHEL: Get out of town.",
        "LORELAI: I thought you knew that.",
        "MICHEL: Dolls, as in they don't have stomachs, lungs or spleens? And we are serving them breakfast?",
        "LORELAI: That's right.",
        "MICHEL: Teeth? Throat? Colons? They don't have these things either? Unless they are Brides of Chucky.",
        "LORELAI: I'm not paying attention to you anymore. [To the woman.] All right, well, I'll order everything, and all you have to do is show up.",
        "WOMAN: The girls are looking forward to this. So are the dolls!",
        "LORELAI: Aw, love that.",
        "WOMAN: 'Bye.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, bye.",

        "[Lorelai and Michel enter. Sookie is preparing stuffed peppers.]",
        "LORELAI: It's silly fun, Michel, girls love dolls. Chill.",
        "SOOKIE: I'm making little pancakes for the dolls, and I found these little forks they can use.",
        "MICHEL: They do not have opposable thumbs!",
        "SOOKIE: Who, the girls? Oh, this is a handicapped group! Poor things.",
        "MICHEL: No, the dolls.",
        "SOOKIE: The dolls? How can a doll be handicapped?",
        "MICHEL: My point exactly! They are plastic and made in Banglagor!",
        "LORELAI: We're doing this. So hop on board, or hop off.",
        "MICHEL: Okay! You don't need to snap my nose off! [He leaves.]",
        "SOOKIE: He's getting on your nerves, huh?",
        "LORELAI: Completely. I'm starving.",
        "SOOKIE: Didn't you have anything at Luke's today?",
        "LORELAI: Not today. There's no food in this fridge.",
        "SOOKIE: It's stuffed with food.",
        "LORELAI: Food that's edible. Food to consume. Everything in here you have to cook.",
        "SOOKIE: I'm a cook.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, forget it.",
        "SOOKIE: What's wrong?",
        "LORELAI: Nothing. Luke and I had a little disagreement last night.",
        "SOOKIE: At the wedding? What happened?",
        "LORELAI: Christopher showed up.",
        "SOOKIE: Oh, no.",
        "LORELAI: My mother invited him.",
        "SOOKIE: Oh, no!",
        "LORELAI: And I hadn't exactly told Luke about that tequila night with Chris after his dad died, so I told him and there was a big blow-up. Chris went nuts, Luke went nuts, and he got mad, and he left. And now he says he needs time to think.",
        "SOOKIE: How much time?",
        "LORELAI: He just said, 'Time'.",
        "SOOKIE: Ooh, I hate when men do that. It's so vague.",
        "LORELAI: I should have told him when it happened. But I blew it. Now, if he'd just give me ten minutes we could hash it out and be back on our way, and not waste time. What's enough time?",
        "SOOKIE: I don't know.",
        "LORELAI: It's been twelve hours. That enough?",
        "SOOKIE: I'd say no.",
        "LORELAI: I'll be distracted until we fix this.",
        "SOOKIE: Well, don't worry, because when a relationship is right, things work out.",
        "LORELAI: I hope so.",
        "SOOKIE: I heard about this couple on one of those morning show, similar to you guys - all lovey-dovey, perfect for each other, you know, headed for marriage - and something happened, and they broke up in their senior year of college, even though they were madly in love with each other. They moved to different parts of the country. They married different people.",
        "LORELAI: They married different people?",
        "SOOKIE: Oh, had kids, grandkids. Then their spouses died, oh, and they were available again, and they talked and they hooked up, and now they're together and they're happily in love after forty years apart. Uh!",
        "LORELAI [shocked]: That's a horrible story!",
        "SOOKIE: No, it's not!",
        "LORELAI: What morning show was that on? I hate that story!",
        "SOOKIE: But they ended up together!",
        "LORELAI: Was it Katie Couric? She seems very dark to me.",
        "SOOKIE: The point is that even if it takes forty years to figure it out, there's still a chance for a happy ending!",
        "LORELAI: But that's all they had! An ending! I don't want to have just an ending with Luke!",
        "SOOKIE: I know, but -",
        "LORELAI: I don't want to have those stupid kids or those ugly grandkids with that loser other guy!",
        "SOOKIE: You don't know, he could be a nice guy.",
        "LORELAI: Even if he's a nice, guy, he's not the guy I want to be with!",
        "SOOKIE: You're right. It's not fair to him.",
        "LORELAI: It's not fair to him, it's dishonest.",
        "SOOKIE: We should name the other guy. I feel like he'd be a Larry.",
        "LORELAI: We're not naming the other guy.",
        "SOOKIE: Okay. I guess it was a bad example. Sorry.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, it's okay.",
        "SOOKIE: But you know, I read a story about another guy that had a fight with his girlfriend, and he said he needed like a week to think it over, and he only needed a day. And he and the girl were back together and were happy forever. No Larry, or loser kids, or anything.",
        "LORELAI: Uh-huh.",
        "SOOKIE: They don't put stuff like that in the newspapers, 'cause it's not as sexy as the forty year story, but it happens all the time, really.",
        "LORELAI: Thanks for making that up.",
        "SOOKIE: You're welcome.",
        "LORELAI: I'm going to go take a walk. I've got some errands to run.",
        "SOOKIE: Good. Clear your head. And it was Katie Couric.",

        "RORY: Whatever that means. Ew, I just got what that means!",
        "PARIS: Cognitive skills are slow today. Grab some Corn Flakes. Nietzsche and Lichtenstein went ape guano over Corn Flakes.",
        "RORY: They make you smart, German and depressed. Why do they have so much Wheat Chex? It doesn't go with anything.",
        "PARIS: Wheat Chex are sort of the pumpernickel bread of the cereal world.",
        "RORY: Well put. So what combo are you thinking today?",
        "PARIS: Cap'n Crunch over a foundation of Rice Krispies, with a perimeter of Shredded Wheat.",
        "RORY: Bold.",
        "PARIS: I like its prospects.",

        "PARIS: It rocks.",

        "PARIS: So, you never told me who the guy was.",
        "RORY: Guy?",
        "PARIS: The guy you were dying for a message from? The guy who has you yoked to your cell phone?",
        "RORY: I am not yoked to my cell phone. I can't hear it when it's in my pocket.",
        "PARIS: Oh, God! Tell me it's not Huntzberger.",
        "RORY: What if it is?",
        "PARIS: With the hair, and the chin like he's the fourth Bee Gee?",
        "RORY: You know, I could put the phone away if it's bothering you.",
        "PARIS: Don't. That pathetic boat you're in? I'm first oarsman. [She pulls out her cell phone and puts it on the table.]",
        "RORY: How so?",
        "PARIS: I'm waiting for Doyle to call. I expected a call yesterday to set something up for last night, but it never came. So I ate a family-sized bag of salt and vinegar potato chips and went to bed at seven-thirty.",
        "RORY: That was the smell.",
        "PARIS: We're better than this, you and me. We're the children of Emma Goldman and Hillary Clinton. Strong, independent. We're better than this.",

And she called him and asked him if he would come over and sit with her because he was her best friend and she needed her best friend, and he did. And they talked all night, and they went out to Hollywood, which was a disaster, but it was good at first. With the boat, and uh, putting the books away. I've seen this movie a lot, so if you don't remember the putting the books away scene, don't feel stupid or anything. I was just sitting here thinking about it, because I, um, I'm in my house, and I was just, uh [Her voice breaks] Could - please come over. I - please. Rea",

And they talked all night, and they went out to Hollywood, which was a disaster, but it was good at first. With the boat, and uh, putting the books away. I've seen this movie a lot, so if you don't remember the putting the books away scene, don't feel stupid or anything.
