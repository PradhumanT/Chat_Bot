        "Lorelai and Rory get the dubious honor of the first ride in Kirk's latest venture, the Stars Hollow pedi-cab. Rory, Paris, Janet and Glenn escape a cold, rainy winter in Connecticut and head to Florida, where they run into Madeline and Louise, who show them the spring break ropes. The Shins play at a club they attend. Jason gives Lorelai the key to his apartment as a symbol of his commitment to their relationship. Lorelai bails Luke out of jail after he's arrested for beating up the car belonging to the man he suspects is having an affair with Nicole; Lorelai stops Luke from beating up the car again when the man is still in there with Nicole."

        "OPEN WITH LORELAI & RORY RIDING IN KIRK'S PEDI-CAB",
        "RORY: This is humiliating.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, no, we passed humiliating two minutes ago.",
        "RORY: Luke's gonna be completely out of doughnuts by the time we get there.",
        "LORELAI: I don't why he won't just buy six extra sprinkled ones, so we'd never have to have the conversation which we're going to have- if we ever get there.",
        "RORY: I got school in two hours. I'm never gonna make it.",
        "LORELAI: Kirk, how you doing? [Kirk nods head] You sure? You seem to be having a little trouble forming words there.",
        "KIRK: [Strained] No...fine...me.",
        "LORELAI: You know, you don't have to take us all the way to Luke's.",
        "RORY: Yes, Kirk, listen to her.",
        "KIRK: I offered you the first ride in Kirk's new Stars Hollow Pedi-cab, and that is exactly what you're gonna get.",
        "LORELAI: Okay.",
        "KIRK: Time just whizzes by when you're riding in a pedi-cab.",
        "GYPSY: Hey, guys.",
        "RORY: Hey, Gypsy.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, Gypsy.",
        "RORY: Gypsy just out-strolled us.",
        "LORELAI: We've gotta get outta here.",
        "KIRK: How we doing back there?",
        "RORY: We're doing fine, Kirk.",
        "KIRK: I figure this baby's gonna be a real money...",
        "LORELAI: A real money- moneywhat, Kirk?",
        "RORY: Kirk, can you breathe?",
        "[Kirk gasps for breath.]",
        "LORELAI: Talk to us.",
        "RORY: Hit the handlebars three times if you can breathe and two if you can't. He hit once.",
        "LORELAI: What does once mean?",
        "RORY: That he couldn't make it to twice?",
        "LORELAI: Kirk. Kirk, stop, please.",
        "KIRK: Just for a second. Then we'll be on our way... like the wind.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, you know what, Kirk? This has been really fun, but I think we'll just hoof it the rest of the way.",
        "KIRK: But the ride wasn't over yet.",
        "RORY: Yeah, but we don't want to hog the cab.",
        "LORELAI: 'Cause there's only one.",
        "RORY: But we'll tell our friends.",
        "KIRK: What was wrong with the ride?",
        "LORELAI: Uh, nothing. I mean, it's great for tourists who are new to the town and want to make sure they don't miss a thing.",
        "KIRK: I wasn't going that slow.",
        "LORELAI: No, you just maybe need a little more training before tourist season kicks in. You know, take a spinning class or buy some legs.",
        "RORY: Sorry, Kirk.",
        "KIRK: You will be sorry. [Calling after them] You'll be sorry you turned down the chance to ride in Stars Hollow's first...",
        "RORY: Now he's gonna hate us forever.",
        "LORELAI: No, he's not. He's just gonna hate us till something shiny comes by.",
        "KIRK: [Riding past them with ease] Well, well, well. I guess it wasn't me that was slowing things down. I guess it was my big, fat cargo.",
        "RORY: Hey!",
        "KIRK: Freshman 15!",
        "LORELAI: Kirk!",
        "KIRK: Can't wait to get my doughnut!",
        "LORELAI: Stay away from my doughnut, Kirk! I mean it! It's my doughnut! Freak!",
        "CUT TO YALE CAFETERIA",
        "PARIS: You might as well stick your head in a sugar bowl.",
        "RORY: If you can find one big enough.",
        "PARIS: You won't be able to eat like that forever, you know.",
        "RORY: What are you getting?",
        "PARIS: All bran. Asher turned me on to it.",
        "RORY: He's a romantic.",
        "PARIS: He wants me to live a long time and be healthy. That is romantic.",
        "RORY: Okay. Just a joke. No reflection on your man-friend.",
        "PARIS: So after breakfast, I'm going to pick up the sign for our table, and then I'll meet you in the courtyard. [Holding teabag] Antioxidants.",
        "RORY: Yeah, I'll meet you in the courtyard.",
        "PARIS: I'm actually really excited about this. I mean, it's our first social protest of significance in college.",
        "RORY: I know, it's so exciting. We actually get to do something important, make a difference, have a say in the world.",
        "PARIS: Wouldn't it be amazing if we could just get one Burmese political prisoner released because of our petition?",
        "RORY: You're thinking small, Geller. Let's get 'em all out.",
        "PARIS: Even the guilty ones.",
        "RORY: Hell, yeah.",
        "GLENN: Seriously? 'Cause that'd be great, really great. Okay, so I'll pick you up at 7:00, Saturday morning.",
        "JANET: Okay, Glenn.",
        "GLENN: Thank you, seriously.",
        "JANET: No problem, Glenn.",
        "GLENN: This is a turning point. You know how you have them, when even the angry voices in your head have to shut up for just a minute?",
        "RORY: Sure.",
        "PARIS: Why is he so happy?",
        "JANET: Oh, I couldn't get away earlier for spring break. My friends are leaving without me. I need a ride, Glenn has a van, and there you go.",
        "PARIS: You're going to ride to Florida with a guy who's bummed that he got turned down by that German cannibal?",
        "JANET: That was just a rumor and, yes, I'm desperate.",
        "RORY: Glenn's not that bad. I'm sure you'll be fine.",
        "JANET: Hey, there's extra room in the van, in case you guys need a ride.",
        "RORY: Oh, no, thank you. I don't think we're gonna do the whole spring break thing.",
        "PARIS: Ever since I broke up with Moondoggie, soakin' up the rays hasn't been the same.",
        "JANET: It's going to be really fun. You're missing out.",
        "RORY: I'm not really a spring break kind of gal, but thank you for the offer.",
        "JANET: Okay, but if you change your mind...",
        "PARIS: Gary Gilmore's got room in the car -- got it.",
        "RORY: Oh, Janet, if you have a chance, you should stop by and sign our petition for political prisoners in Burma.",
        "JANET: I'll try. Actually, I have to run out and get a new bathing suit before my class this afternoon.",
        "RORY: Okay.",
        "PARIS: [Calling after Janet] Think of all the tortured souls festering in Burma while you're at the size-2 rack. [To Rory] I hate that she's thin.",
        "CUT TO LUKE'S DINER",
        "LORELAI: [Sighs] Hey, Luke.",
        "LUKE: I saw you come in. I was gonna get to you, okay?",
        "LORELAI: Sorry?",
        "LUKE: If you don't like the service, you can go somewhere else.",
        "LORELAI: Who could not like the service?",
        "LUKE: I'm busy. You ready to order?",
        "LORELAI: Coffee for now. Is everything okay?",
        "LUKE: You're not gonna eat?",
        "LORELAI: No, I just came in for coffee and to show you something. We got the sample stationery and postcards for the inn.",
        "LUKE: What?",
        "LORELAI: You know, the stationery and the postcards that you leave in the guests' room so that they can write a letter home saying, \"Having a great time- wish you were here.\" Which, of course, they don't, because you were the thing they were trying to get away from in this first place.",
        "LUKE: Nobody uses that stuff.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, sure they do.",
        "LUKE: I have never once stayed in a hotel and used the stationery or written a postcard. Are you gonna order?",
        "LORELAI: I did order, and what is with you?",
        "LUKE: Nothin'. I'm fine. The paper's fine. The postcards are fine. I don't know why you're showing them to me anyhow.",
        "LORELAI: Because you are an investor in the inn. I want to keep you apprised of the goings-on.",
        "LUKE: I am not an investor. I loaned you money.",
        "LORELAI: That is what investors do.",
        "LUKE: An investor goes to meetings.",
        "LORELAI: We're having a meeting.",
        "LUKE: They're involved in the business decisions.",
        "LORELAI: Hello...stationary. Decide -- yes, no.",
        "LUKE: [Sighs] I'll get your coffee.",
        "LORELAI: Um...do you want to talk about it?",
        "LUKE: What?",
        "LORELAI: Whatever it is that's put you in this charming mood.",
        "LUKE: [Clears throat, lowers voice] I am not wearing my socks.",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "LUKE: I am not wearing my socks.",
        "LORELAI: So, what are those, someone else's?",
        "LUKE: Yes.",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "LUKE: I am wearing someone else's socks.",
        "LORELAI: I'm sorry, I need more.",
        "LUKE: I spent the night at Nicole's place.",
        "LORELAI: Also known as \"your place\".",
        "LUKE: Got up a little late, grabbed a pair of socks, and it wasn't until I was halfway to work that I realized they were someone else's socks.",
        "LORELAI: And you're sure about this?",
        "LUKE: Hey, if there's one thing in this life I am sure about, it's my socks. I buy the same brand in bulk, and I've been doing this for as long as I can remember. My socks are all white with a red stripe. These are white with a gold stripe and some sort of fruity padding in the toe.",
        "LORELAI: Maybe they're Jess' socks.",
        "LUKE: They are not Jess' socks.",
        "LORELAI: Well, maybe when you went to the laundromat, someone accidentally left a pair of socks in the dryer, and then your --",
        "LUKE: I don't go to a laundromat.",
        "LORELAI: Uh, maybe they're Nicole's socks. You know, her gym socks or... you're not wearing your socks.",
        "LUKE: I am not wearing my socks.",
        "CUT TO PARIS & RORY OUTSIDE AT YALE IN A RAINSTORM AT THEIR PETITION TABLE",
        "RORY: Show your support for the Burmese prisoners.",
        "PARIS: Sign up now- take a stand.",
        "RORY: This bowl of rice is all a Burmese prisoner gets to eat in a day. One bowl- that's it. No butter or soy sauce...",
        "PARIS: Enjoy your \"Maxim.\" You couldn't read that in Burma!",
        "RORY: I'm freezing.",
        "PARIS: Me too.",
        "RORY: [Sighs] Look at all these hypocrites passing by. Everyone claims to be so politically aware, but not one person can stop by for two seconds to sign a stupid petition.",
        "PARIS: People suck. [Jumps up] You all suck!",
        "RORY: Paris, the rice!",
        "PARIS: Great, we have one prop, and it's blowing away.",
        "RORY: You knocked it over.",
        "PARIS: Well, you put it right in front of me.",
        "RORY: How was I supposed to know you were gonna jump out of your seat like a maniac?",
        "PARIS: You know me. You room with me. You should have known.",
        "GLENN: Hey, Rory, Paris.",
        "RORY: Oh, Glenn, I'm so glad you stopped by because this is an issue that affects every person that has a heart and a soul.",
        "PARIS: A great injustice is being perpetrated on our watch, and we've got to do something to stop it.",
        "RORY: Aren't you gonna sign the petition?",
        "GLENN: No, I just needed a place to put my sandwich down.",
        "RORY: Is that a raindrop?",
        "PARIS: Yep.",
        "CUT TO PARIS & RORY RUNNING INTO THEIR DORM",
        "PARIS: Out of the way.",
        "RORY: Move, move, move!",
        "FEMALE STUDENT: [Walking out of dorm] Is it raining?",
        "PARIS: No, it's National Baptism Day. Tie your tubes, idiot.",
        "RORY: Wet.",
        "PARIS: Cold.",
        "RORY: Go, go! I get the radiator.",
        "PARIS: No way.",
        "RORY: You got it last night.",
        "PARIS: I did not!",
        "RORY: Paris, you took up the whole thing with your \"Hey, Gore, do not endorse me\" sweatshirt, and my blue sweater is still soaked.",
        "PARIS: Fine! Take half.",
        "RORY: Oh, my god, I'm cold!",
        "PARIS: Can't stop shaking.",
        "RORY: We're wimps -- we would last two seconds in Burma.",
        "PARIS: At least it's warm in Burma.",
        "RORY: Yeah. Okay, we're horrible.",
        "PARIS: This is the kind of cold you read about in a Dickens novel. We should be in a workhouse or shilling for Fagin.",
        "RORY: It's supposed to be spring. Why is it still cold?",
        "PARIS: It's been the coldest winter in the history of winter.",
        "RORY: My brain- I think it's frozen. Is that possible?",
        "PARIS: And these gray skies- it's a blanket of misery.",
        "RORY: All I can think about is getting warm. That's all I can think about.",
        "PARIS: It's warm in Florida.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "PARIS: Nothing.",
        "RORY: Did you say \"Florida\"?",
        "PARIS: No. [Pauses] Yes.",
        "RORY: Seriously?",
        "PARIS: Maybe.",
        "RORY: But it's spring break.",
        "PARIS: I know.",
        "RORY: It's \"girls gone wild,\" and boys doing the twist. We're not spring-breaky people, are we?",
        "PARIS: I don't know what we are, but I am so cold right now that the thought of spending a week with a bunch of drunken bimbos and rattle-headed frat boys seems like a very good trade off for being warm.",
        "RORY: Warm...",
        "PARIS: Warm...",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "RORY: Mom, where's my bathing suit?",
        "LORELAI: Uh...do you have a bathing suit?",
        "RORY: Of course I have a bathing suit.",
        "LORELAI: When was the last time you wore it?",
        "RORY: I don't remember.",
        "LORELAI: Uh, did it involve a rubber ducky?",
        "RORY: No...I don't think.",
        "LORELAI: Check the bottom drawer, and I will look in your closet. So now, tell me again- who's driving?",
        "RORY: Glenn. It's his mom's van.",
        "LORELAI: And this Glenn- he's a good driver?",
        "RORY: I have no idea.",
        "LORELAI: Kid- you've got to learn to lie.",
        "RORY: Glenn's a very responsible guy. I'm sure it will be fine.",
        "LORELAI: And the place you're staying is safe?",
        "RORY: Yes.",
        "LORELAI: Now you're catching on. Ahh! Aha! Bathing suit. Now we just have to find the wimple that goes with it.",
        "RORY: Give me that, please. Hey, was I supposed to clear this with you first?",
        "LORELAI: Clear what with me?",
        "RORY: Going away.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, I don't know.",
        "RORY: I mean, I don't live here anymore, so I'm not sure what the protocol is.",
        "LORELAI: Ah, well. I think as long as I know now, and I feel as if I have veto power, we're good.",
        "RORY: You have veto power?",
        "LORELAI: No. I feel as if I have veto power- very different statement.",
        "RORY: Got it.",
        "LORELAI: But you'll call me a lot while you're there, right?",
        "RORY: You're not worried, are you? Because I'm just going for the sun and to read, nothing more.",
        "LORELAI: I know, I know. It's just it's always the good kids who've never had a drink that take one sip of Kahlua and fall out of a window.",
        "RORY: So you're sad you never taught me how to drink?",
        "LORELAI: Exactly!",
        "RORY: Well grab a bottle and some quarters and let's go.",
        "LORELAI: No falling out of windows.",
        "RORY: Not even a first floor one.",
        "LORELAI: And don't drink. And after you're done not drinking, drink tons of water and take two aspirin before you go to bed.",
        "RORY: Got it.",
        "LORELAI: And take Paris with you everywhere. Not much can happen with that girl along.",
        "RORY: Got it. [Horn honks outside.] They're here.",
        "LORELAI: Oh. Maybe they can stop by a bathing suit store along the way.",
        "RORY: My suit is fine.",
        "LORELAI: No, sure it is. It's nice to be able to go from the beach to the mosque without having to change.",
        "GLENN: Seriously, Paris, get out!",
        "PARIS: No! I have to drive.",
        "GLENN: You drive exactly like you look like you drive.",
        "PARIS: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "GLENN: You speed like a maniac. You zip in and out of lanes. You tailgate.",
        "PARIS: They were going two miles an hour.",
        "GLENN: It was a driving-school car.",
        "PARIS: Well, they went to school to learn a lesson. I was just giving them their money's worth.",
        "RORY: Hey, guys.",
        "PARIS: Let's go. We're on a schedule. Get away from Glenn.",
        "JANET: Thank god you're here.",
        "RORY: Glenn, this is my mom.",
        "LORELAI: Hi, I'm Lorelai. Hey, congratulations on being student of the month at Grandville Middle School.",
        "GLENN: Thanks.",
        "LORELAI: You lookin' forward to the beach?",
        "GLENN: Yes, I am.",
        "LORELAI: You know, you don't have to show up in what you're going to wear. They'll let you change when you get there.",
        "GLENN: I'm not cold.",
        "LORELAI: No, of course not. [Hands Glenn Rory's bags] Could you? Thanks.",
        "RORY: So, how come Paris is driving?",
        "PARIS: Are we gonna go through this again?",
        "RORY: I didn't know we'd already gone through it.",
        "PARIS: I can't be in a car if anybody else is driving, okay? If I die in a car crash, it's going to be at my own hand.",
        "LORELAI: Hi, Paris.",
        "PARIS: Hi, Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: Bye.",
        "RORY: No windows.",
        "LORELAI: No windows. Oh, hey, um, Glenn, would you mind if Rory sits up front? She gets carsick.",
        "GLENN: Oh. Okay.",
        "LORELAI: Airbags. Okay, um, have fun. Drive safely.",
        "PARIS: Let's go...and say a prayer for the road kill. [Tires screech as she pulls away.]",
        "CUT TO VAN PULLING INTO SEA SPRITE HOTEL",
        "GLENN: You're a lunatic!",
        "PARIS: Hey, I shaved three hours off the MapQuest estimate. How about a \"thank you\" for that? Who's in charge here?",
        "RORY: I'm guessing pink shirts and white shorts?",
        "GLENN: I think my clothing choice has been vindicated.",
        "PARIS: Swank attire and desperation for approval. The chicks are gonna eat you up. It is warm. Are you feeling the warmth?",
        "RORY: I'm definitely starting to thaw.",
        "JACK: Name, please.",
        "JANET: It's under \"Billings.\"",
        "JACK: Okay... okay, we have you girls in room 6.",
        "PARIS: Room 6, okay. And what is your name?",
        "JACK: Jack.",
        "PARIS: Jack. Well, Jack, hello. I'm Paris, and this is Andrew [Holds up a $20 bill]. And we just want to make sure that we're getting your very best room.",
        "JACK: Actually, room 9 has a better view, and it's closer to the ice machine.",
        "PARIS: Let's go with 9. Now, who's gonna help with our bags? Good. Okay, those four bags... Uh, Rory, your book bag?",
        "RORY: Um, sure.",
        "JANET: I'm gonna go for a run.",
        "RORY: Now?",
        "JANET: Just a short one around the block.",
        "RORY: She looks so normal, and then that happens.",
        "PARIS: Come on. Paris Geller, room 9. Remember that. See, a lot of people make the mistake of tipping at the end of a trip. But I always tip as you go along. That way, they never know when the honey pot dries up, and it keeps them from going through your stuff and robbing you blind. Paris Geller, room 9. Remember that.",
        "RORY: Oh, man, look at that. We're right on the ocean. Paris, look at it. It's right there.",
        "PARIS: I see it. Oh, hey, we're in room 9. Feel free to keep the sheets clean and the towels coming. [Goes into room 9] Okay...not bad. Hey, you know what would be swell? A VCR to go with that television set. You mind? You're aces, pal...really. I'm giving the toast at your wedding.",
        "RORY: Well, at least it doesn't smell bad in here.",
        "PARIS: Pull your covers down and roll on the bed.",
        "RORY: Why?",
        "PARIS: We are sharing this room with four other girls, Rory. Plus 10K Barbie- we have to stake out our territory.",
        "RORY: Yes, and then we need to up your dosage.",
        "PARIS: Look, a person comes in, they see a dent in the bed, possibly a hair on the pillow...",
        "RORY: So the person's David Caruso?",
        "PARIS: They'll figure that bed is taken. They will then move on to the couch or the rollaway.",
        "RORY: That's insane.",
        "PARIS: Okay, suit yourself. [Starts to bounce on the bed. Rory soon follows suit on the other bed.]",
        "RORY: And I was worried I would I feel stupid.",
        "PARIS: Stupid but well rested.",
        "RORY: How long do we have to do this?",

I'll tell you when you get here. Thanks... if you come. Oh, one more thing. I need to borrow a little money- 300 bucks. It's just a loan, and, oh, hell, it's for my bail.
