        "STARS HOLLOW",
        "[Town residents are standing in a long line going into a large brick house with massive white columns. Lorelai and Sookie are near the back of the line, with Davey asleep in his stroller.]",
        "LORELAI: Ugh, raisins. What are the pruney red things?",
        "SOOKIE: Dried cranberries.",
        "LORELAI: Gone. What's this?",
        "SOOKIE: Carob.",
        "LORELAI: Adios.",
        "SOOKIE: Okay, why do we buy trail mix if you're going to pick everything out?",
        "LORELAI: Well, they've ruined trail mix. Used to be simple. Now they put too much stuff in it. Your mouth doesn't know what to expect with any given bite. Will it be fruity? Will it be granola-y? Will it be chocolate substitute-y? What's this?",
        "SOOKIE: Soybean.",
        "LORELAI: Bah, squirrel food! [She throws the soybean on the ground.]",
        "[Taylor, ahead of them, turns around.]",
        "TAYLOR: Ladies, please. We're saying good-bye to Mr. Twickham.",
        "SOOKIE: So?",
        "TAYLOR: The man's on his deathbed. Show a little respect.",
        "LORELAI: Taylor, Old Man Twickham's been dying for twenty years.",
        "MISS PATTY: This is my seventeenth time saying adios.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, I think you have the record, Patty.",
        "SOOKIE: I forget, when was the last time we thought he was dying?",
        "MISS PATTY: It's been a good two years.",
        "LORELAI: I remember now. The last time - the rain?",
        "SOOKIE: We got drenched.",
        "LORELAI: Made the whole \"he's dying\" thing a total bummer.",
        "TAYLOR: Ladies, please! You may not be respecting this moment but all the rest of us are.",
        "[Kirk walks by carrying an assortment of flags, beach balls, hats, and other souvenirs.]",
        "KIRK: Get your Twickham souvenirs here! Twickham souvenirs! I've got your bats! I've got your balls! I've got your foam fingers! Get 'em before he's gone!",
        "[Andrew walks by.]",
        "LORELAI: Oh, how's Mr. Twickham looking, Andrew?",
        "ANDREW: A little tired.",
        "LORELAI: Well, dying is exhausting.",
        "ANDREW: Yeah, he's thinking of taking a break and picking up again tomorrow.",
        "SOOKIE: Ugh, no.",
        "LORELAI: We've been waiting for an hour.",
        "ANDREW: He's kind of distracted anyway. The whole time I was there he was Tivo-ing through a fresh Summerland.",
        "[Andrew leaves. Sookie turns to Lorelai.]",
        "SOOKIE: Do we have time to come back tomorrow?",
        "LORELAI: Uh, no. Not really. [She calls out.] Hey, everybody? Um, keep it quick in there, okay? \"Good morning, Mr. Twickham. Good-bye Mr. Twickham.\" And then vamoose.",
        "SOOKIE: He should really start dying earlier in the day.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah. [Digging in the bag of trail mix.] Ugh, green stuff? Come on! [She throws it.] What's green?",
        "OPENING CREDITS",
        "YALE DORMS - RORY'S BEDROOM",
        "[The score from a Star Wars movie is playing loudly from the common room. Rory's cell phone rings.]",
        "RORY: Hello?",
        "[Scene cuts between Lorelai's kitchen and Rory's room.]",
        "LORELAI: He's dead.",
        "RORY: Who?",
        "LORELAI: Old Man Twickham.",
        "RORY [disbelief]: No!",
        "LORELAI: Yes!",
        "RORY: It's got to be a mistake.",
        "LORELAI: It's not. The man is gone.",
        "RORY: I don't believe it. I mean, are you sure?",
        "LORELAI: There's no breath left in him. The light's gone out of his eyes. He smelled the burnt almonds. He's feeding the worms. He's chatting up his grandpa. He is the old man formerly known as Twickham.",
        "RORY: Wow. I can't believe he's gone. I mean, he's been dying my whole life.",
        "LORELAI: And I just got my good-bye in. He was about to close shop for the day but we got in, told him good-bye and that we'd miss him, we left and then apparently he just closed his eyes. Muttered something about Lori Loughlin and that was that.",
        "RORY: Wow.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah.",
        "RORY: He's never died before.",
        "LORELAI: I guess there's a first time for everything. Kirk's happy, though. His dying caused a run on souvenirs. [She looks at the beach ball, hats and flags on her counter.]",
        "RORY [disapproving]: Tacky.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, yeah. Tacky. So, are you coming home this weekend?",
        "RORY: Probably not. Maybe next week.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. I just always like to check.",
        "RORY: So, I should go. Sorry about Old Man Twickham.",
        "LORELAI: Got to move on. I hear Old Man Ketchum has a nasty cough. Could turn into something.",
        "RORY: That's the spirit. Bye.",
        "[She hangs up the phone and goes out into the common room. Paris is slumped on a chair, wearing pajamas, remote in hand.]",
        "RORY [shouting over the movie]: Pathetic!",
        "PARIS: What?",
        "RORY: Nothing important, I just wanted to inform you that you're pathetic!",
        "PARIS: Back at you, sister.",
        "RORY: I am not pathetic.",
        "PARIS: Oh, come on. We're in the same situation, except you're in denial.",
        "RORY: I'm not in denial!",
        "PARIS: I haven't seen Logan lately.",
        "RORY: Well, why don't you call him up, then? Bet he misses you.",
        "PARIS: Is he missing you?",
        "RORY: Good-bye.",
        "PARIS: Have fun pretending the sky is green.",
        "RORY: Yeah, have fun re-enacting the Maxell tape ad.",
        "[Rory slams the door behind her. Paris furiously turns up the already-too-loud volume.]",
        "STARS HOLLOW - SOPHIE'S MUSIC SHOP",
        "[Lane and Zach enter. Sophie is behind the counter.]",
        "ZACH: Hey Soph.",
        "SOPHIE: You wash your hands?",
        "ZACH: Front and back.",
        "SOPHIE: Let's see 'em.",
        "ZACH: So we're never going to forget the peanut butter on the sitar? [He holds up his hands.]",
        "SOPHIE: Good God, man, have you heard of hand cream?",
        "ZACH: Okay if we walk around?",
        "SOPHIE: Carefully. Hi, Lane.",
        "LANE: Hi, Sophie.",
        "[Zach and Lane take a few steps. Zach starts whispering to Lane.]",
        "ZACH: Show her the thing.",
        "LANE: Something like that's very self-conscious.",
        "ZACH: It's why you brought it.",
        "LANE: I know.",
        "ZACH: So, show her.",
        "[Lane walks back over to the counter.]",
        "LANE: So, Sophie Bloom. Your last name's Bloom.",
        "SOPHIE: Thanks for the info.",
        "LANE: I was looking through some old vinyl I have. I don't have much, because I was born right on the cusp of the CD revolution. But I originally had a record player. A Snoopy record player. Boy, I love this record player. And shutting my door and listening to music on it -",
        "SOPHIE: Oh, my God, Garrison Keillor, what is your point?",
        "LANE: I saw the name \"Sophie Bloom\" on this album - the one non-Christian one my mother allowed me to have. It just popped out at me and I was wondering - [She hands the record to Sophie.]",
        "SOPHIE [a little repulsed]: Oh, this thing.",
        "LANE: So, it's you. You wrote these songs.",
        "SOPHIE: Long time ago.",
        "LANE [gushing]: I think this is amazing! Because I want to do more than just drum. I would like to write and compose and I was wondering if we could sit down sometime and just talk about music, because I think you have so much you can pass on to me. Woman to woman. Really, just coffee sometime. My treat.",
        "SOPHIE: Well, I suppose sometime when I'm not working or out of town, if my boyfriend's busy and my laundry's done, and I'm not sick and there's nothing on TV, we could maybe meet up for a couple of minutes.",
        "LANE: It's a date.",
        "[Smiling, she re-joins Zach as he browses.]",
        "LUKE'S DINER - NIGHT",
        "[Luke is cleaning up when Lorelai enters.]",
        "LUKE: Hey, there she is, the woman of the hour!",
        "LORELAI: Apparently that's me. [They hug.]",
        "LUKE: I am blown away by this!",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, well, my hugs are that powerful.",
        "LUKE: Well, well, I'm talking about the article. You're going to be on the cover of a magazine! That's a big deal!",
        "LORELAI: Well, it's the inn, it's not me, but yes, it is a big deal!",
        "LUKE: So, how'd they tell you? They phone you, or they, you know, they e-mail you?",
        "LORELAI: They just said they were so impressed by the inn, they were so impressed by my story-",
        "LUKE: It's a great story.",
        "LORELAI: Well, it's a little thin, when you compare it to War and Peace, but",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "LUKE: What? You started with nothing. It's a great story. The magazine's pretty good, too. I did some research.",
        "LORELAI: Oh. Research?",
        "[He pulls out a few magazines from under the counter.]",
        "LUKE: Yeah, I got a bunch of back issues and I read them. I tried to figure out who should interview you. Okay. Alicia Kensington. Staff writer, too green and way too stiff. Too many adverbs. Frederick Fairmount. Pff, he talks more about himself than the person he's interviewing. Something boozy about him, too.",
        "LORELAI: I don't think they let you pick who's going to interview you.",
        "LUKE: Well, just in case they offer. But this is big. [He touches her arm.]",
        "LORELAI [smiles]: Yeah, I guess it is.",
        "[She sees the window between the Diner and the ice cream shop, taped up with newspaper.]",
        "LORELAI: Oh! What happened there?",
        "LUKE: Eh, what do you think? Taylor.",
        "LORELAI: How did Taylor break the window?",
        "LUKE: How do you think? By being Taylor.",
        "LORELAI: Taylor's Taylor-ness can now break glass?",
        "LUKE: You know what I mean. He's doing something, and crash, bang, there you go. Hey, is it, uh, six yet?",
        "LORELAI: Uh, a little past.",
        "LUKE: Ah, shoot. Town meeting's started.",
        "LORELAI: So?",
        "LUKE: So I thought we'd go. I mean, you like those things, right?",
        "LORELAI: Uh, yeah, but you don't.",
        "LUKE: Yes, but, this is your big night, you know, with the article and everything. Look, why don't we hit the town meeting and then we'll go get something to eat, like a little celebration?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, sounds good!",
        "LUKE: Yeah, great! Let's go, we got to, we got to hurry.",
        "LORELAI: Okay.",
        "[He hurries her out the door.]",
        "STARS HOLLOW TOWN MEETING",
        "[Taylor is addressing the town with Kirk standing next to him.]",
        "TAYLOR: Come on, people! It's not that complicated.",
        "KIRK: I don't want to be a burden.",
        "TAYLOR: Patty? What about that couch you have at the back or your studio?",
        "[Patty opens her mouth to respond, but is cut off by Kirk.]",
        "KIRK: In her freezing cold studio with no insulation and no heat. Sounds great.",
        "[Taylor continues as Luke and Lorelai sneak in the back and sit next to Sookie.]",
        "SOOKIE [whispers]: Hi.",
        "LORELAI: Hi, what's happening?",
        "SOOKIE: Problems with Kirk's schedule.",
        "LORELAI: Ah. Can't Sheriff Taylor just let him share a cell with Otis for the night?",
        "MISS PATTY: Well, maybe the Morris' will take him again.",
        "KIRK: Their kids stuck things in my nose.",
        "MISS PATTY: Well, then, lock the door when you sleep!",
        "KIRK: It wasn't while I was asleep.",
        "SOOKIE [whispering to Lorelai]: Hey. How'd you drag Luke here?",
        "LORELAI: He wanted to come.",
        "KIRK: I'll just sleep outside in the gazebo. I would ask, though, that if I die from exposure, don't just dump me in the landfill.",
        "MISS PATTY: No one's dumping you in a landfill, Kirk.",
        "TAYLOR [regretfully]: It's against regulations. Let's pigeonhole this matter for now, people. Get on to our next order of business. It's the matter of the estate of the late Joshua Twickham. As you know -",
        "LORELAI [whispers to Sookie]: You bring food?",
        "SOOKIE: After the trail mix fiasco, I wouldn't dare.",
        "[Luke shushes her.]",
        "SOOKIE: Sorry.",
        "[Lorelai and Sookie exchange an amused look.]",
        "TAYLOR: I am happy to say that this beloved elder was generous even on his deathbed. Mr. Twickham has left his beautiful home to the town.",
        "[The townspeople murmur.]",
        "KIRK: Is his deathbed still there? I'm not picky.",
        "LUKE: What does that mean, to the town?",
        "TALYOR: Luke! What are you doing here?",
        "LUKE: Just keep going, Taylor.",
        "TAYLOR: He left the house to the Historical Society along with his ample collection of valuable memorabilia. His will stipulates that the house is to be converted into a museum.",
        "LUKE: A museum?",
        "TAYLOR: Are you going to interrupt me the whole meeting?",
        "LUKE: I'm just asking.",
        "TAYLOR: A Stars Hollow museum. We will display his personal historical artifacts for a period of two months. After two months, the house is to be disposed of at the discretion of the head of the Historical Society, he meaning me.",
        "LUKE: Oh, goody.",
        "TAYLOR: So now you're going to talk under your breath.",
        "LUKE: I'm sorry.",
        "TAYLOR: Funny, I didn't hear those words come out of your mouth this morning after you tried to kill me.",
        "LORELAI [looks at Luke]: What?",
        "TAYLOR: So, we're going to need strong volunteers to make this dream a reality. Now, anyone with appropriate skills, let's see a show of hands.",
        "[Several men, including Luke, raise their hands.]",
        "LORELAI: Uh, you're really going to have to fill me in on the gag, here.",
        "TAYLOR: Luke, don't come to these things just to mock our business.",
        "LUKE: I'm not mocking anything, I'm volunteering.",
        "TAYLOR: After you threw a frying pan at my head.",
        "LORELAI: You threw a frying pan at Taylor's head?",
        "TAYLOR: Just for playing my Muzak too loud. I mean, who doesn't love Muzak?",
        "SOOKIE [raises her hand]: Oh! Music lovers?",
        "LUKE: The thing slipped out of my hand.",
        "TAYLOR: Right after you said, quote, um, \"you better duck, Taylor, because I'm going to throw this frying pan at your head\"?",
        "LORELAI: You threw a frying pan at Taylor's head without me there? I hate you.",
        "LUKE: I'm volunteering. Take it or leave it.",
        "TAYLOR: Patty, take down the names of the legitimate volunteers, please. Now, whoever's actually going to show up, our day starts at seven sharp. To the rest, shame on you. Now, onto item number three. The budgetary concerns about the new snowplow.",
        "LORELAI [to Luke]: I'm sorry, does Taylor have compromising pictures of you or something?",
        "LUKE: It's no joke.",
        "LORELAI: Why on earth are you volunteering for Taylor?",
        "LUKE: Well, um -",
        "LORELAI: Luke.",
        "LUKE: How well did you know Old Man Twickham?",
        "LORELAI: Somewhat.",
        "LUKE: Well, I knew him all my life. He was like another dad, in a way.",
        "LORELAI: Oh. Nice.",
        "LUKE: And I didn't show up to say good-bye, and I'm feeling a little guilty about it, you know. He's a good guy. I just want to do right by him.",
        "LORELAI: Well. You are a terrific fellow, Luke Danes.",
        "TAYLOR: No, Kirk. If you build an igloo to sleep in, and the town plow runs over it, it kills you, we are not going to just leave your corpse in the snow.",
        "KIRK: Okay, but I don't want to be a burden.",
        "STARS HOLLOW - TWICKHAM HOUSE",
        "[Taylor walks down the front step talking to a man who is writing on a clipboard.]",
        "TAYLOR: Let's store all the boxes inside. Sort through them in there, then store what we don't need in the garage.",
        "[The man nods. Luke gets out of his truck.]",
        "LUKE: Morning, Taylor.",
        "TAYLOR: What are you doing here?",
        "LUKE: I volunteered.",
        "TAYLOR: I don't get the joke.",
        "LUKE: There's no joke! I'm at your disposal.",
        "[Taylor frowns and turns back to the man with the clipboard.]",
        "TAYLOR: Now, we're going to need a nice flat staging area, perhaps over there, [he points] because there's no space here out front.",
        "LUKE: What about right here? [He points at a space right next to where they are standing.]",
        "TAYLOR: My office is going here.",
        "LUKE: Your office? Why do you need an office?",
        "TAYLOR: So you came to complain?",
        "LUKE: No, I was just -",
        "TAYLOR: I'm organizing! I'm working! I need an office!",
        "LUKE: Okay, fine. Sorry. Carry on.",
        "TAYLOR [calling out]: Come on, everybody! [To the clipboard man] Let's hook up with people inside and I'll start handing out assignments.",
        "[They start walking into the house. Luke follows. Taylor turns around.]",
        "TAYLOR: Eh, where are you going?",
        "LUKE: Inside.",
        "TAYLOR: Why?",
        "LUKE: I'm a volunteer!",
        "[Taylor rolls his eyes and they all go inside.]",
        "KYLE: Hey, Luke.",
        "LUKE: Hey, Kyle.",
        "KYLE: Just thought I'd lend a hand.",
        "LUKE: Uh-huh, good one.",
        "[Kyle has a hook instead of his right hand.]",
        "TAYLOR: Is this everybody, people?",
        "KIRK: I believe so, Taylor.",
        "GYPSY [to Luke]: What the hell are you doing here?",
        "LUKE: I can't keep answering this question.",
        "TAYLOR: Come in, good folk. We are embarking on a wonderful adventure. Right here in this room, we will display Mr. Twickham's impressive collection of memorabilia. Upstairs, we'll house the multimedia dioramas depicting the history of the town.",
        "LUKE: Sounds good.",
        "TAYLOR: Now, I took the liberty of doing up some fun shirts that we all can wear. Everyone, please. Put one on.",
        "[Kirk starts handing out the bright orange t-shirts. The volunteers mumble as they put on the shirts.]",
        "TAYLOR: Isn't that nice. Now, they all take a cold water wash and tumble dry. Low. Now, before we begin, I'd like us all to join hands.",
        "LUKE: What?",
        "GYPSY: He's a twisted little perv if you ask me.",
        "TAYLOR: Come on, everybody, take hands.",
        "[Luke rolls his eyes, but takes Taylor's hand on the right, and \"hooks\" up with Kyle on the left.]",
        "TAYLOR: Let's close our eyes and visualize our goal. Picture a freckle-faced boy, eyes wide with curiosity, drinking in the history of the town as he wanders the room. He's by the door, he's going by the stairs, he's delighting -",
        "KIRK: Luke's peeking.",
        "LUKE: That means you're peeking too, snitch.",
        "TAYLOR: Quiet! Please!",
        "GYPSY: Hey, I've lost track. Where's the freckle-faced kid walking?",
        "TAYLOR: Okay, I think that's enough visualizing, everybody. How about we start organizing all these boxes, okay?",
        "[The circle breaks apart. Luke tries to pull away, but Taylor holds on.]",
        "TAYLOR: I'd like a moment with you, Luke.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, time to let go, there, Taylor!",
        "TAYLOR: I want the straight skinny from you.",
        "LUKE: Really, let go of my hand.",
        "TAYLOR: Not until you tell me what you're doing.",
        "LUKE: I'm really just trying to get my hand away from you.",
        "TAYLOR: Why are you here? Why did you volunteer?",
        "LUKE: Because I wanted to!",
        "TAYLOR: Luke, you hated Old Man Twickham. I know that for a fact. You said despicable things about him your whole life!",
        "LUKE: Well, okay. If you must know, Lorelai asked me.",
        "TAYLOR: Lorelai?",
        "LUKE: That's right. You know, we've been through a bit of a rough patch -",
        "TAYLOR: Yes.",
        "LUKE: Well, I want to make things right with her. Get off to a good new start. She really wants me to get involved with community things, so she asked me to get involved. So, I'm doing it for her.",
        "TAYLOR: Well, I think that's very nice.",
        "LUKE: So I'm here for you, Taylor. One hundred percent.",
        "TAYLOR: Good. Because you're not untalented.",
        "LUKE [trying unsuccessfully to take his hand back]: Thank you.",
        "TAYLOR: How about I make you my right-hand man? Stick by me! Be me when I'm not here! What do you say?",
        "LUKE: Well, I'll need my right hand back for that, I think.",
        "TAYLOR: Of course. [He lets go of Luke's hand.] Okay. Good. This is a new side of you, Luke, and I like it. All right, let's get started, everybody! [He turns away.] Kirk, grab Kyle and come on over and help me start in this corner.",
        "[Luke examines his hand.]",
