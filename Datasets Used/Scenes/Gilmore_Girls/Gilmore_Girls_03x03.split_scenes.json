        "OPEN AT LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "[Lorelai and Rory are on the sofa watching \"The Brady Bunch Variety Hour\"]",
        "RORY: This is sublime.",
        "LORELAI: It was the golden age of television.",
        "RORY: The music, the costumes, the sets.",
        "LORELAI: All cylinders were fired on this one, boy!",
        "RORY: And who knew that they all had such musical talent?",
        "LORELAI: And such far out booty shaking abilities, as well.",
        "[The mailman walks through the front door and sets the mail on the bench]",
        "EDDIE: Mail, ladies.",
        "LORELAI: Thanks, Eddie!",
        "[Eddie walks back out; Rory walks over to get the mail]",
        "RORY: Did you see that TV Guide had this on their list of the worst fifty shows of all time?",
        "LORELAI: I know! Who are they to judge?",
        "RORY: I know, it's on my top fifty best.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, right after \"Holmes and Yoyo\" and \"Hee Haw Honeys.\" Oh, Rory, get back here! They're in clown suits and headed for the pool.",
        "RORY: Oh my God.",
        "LORELAI: Honey, come here.",
        "RORY: It's here.",
        "LORELAI: What's here?",
        "RORY: My application to Harvard.",
        "LORELAI: Oh my God. [walks over to look at it] It's beautiful.",
        "RORY: Impressive letterage, huh?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, yeah, it's so. . .",
        "RORY: Very.",
        "LORELAI: Can I hold it?",
        "RORY: Be careful.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, it's heavy, heavy with importance.",
        "RORY: I feel dizzy.",
        "LORELAI: Are you sure that's not just the sight of Robert Reed in the tight clown pants?",
        "RORY: Oh, geez. Let the record show that when my application to Harvard arrived, we were watching \"The Brady Bunch Variety Hour.\"",
        "LORELAI: You don't lose points for that, do you?",
        "RORY: I hope not. Man, this morning I was reading Dead Souls \u0096 it couldn't have come then?",
        "LORELAI: Well, we'll just tell people that's what you were doing, and that I was studying a really big globe. They'll never know.",
        "RORY: You can keep a secret?",
        "LORELAI: Not so far, but there's always a first.",
        "RORY: Dead Souls and a really big globe.",
        "LORELAI: Deal. [looks at TV] Oh, kayaks!",
        "[opening credits]",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S KITCHEN",
        "[Lorelai sits at the table with the Harvard application while Rory gets a drink from the refrigerator]",
        "LORELAI: Come on, come on, I wanna get started.",
        "RORY: Hold your horses there little Miss Horsie Holder.",
        "LORELAI: They're going to expect a higher level of wit when you're at Harvard. Oh, watch that drink.",
        "RORY: I'm nowhere near it.",
        "LORELAI: Well, keep it that way. This is an uncontaminated area. I even cleaned the table using something other than the sleeve of my sweater and spit. [shows her a bottle of cleanser]",
        "RORY: Lovely image. I'll be careful.",
        "LORELAI: All right, here we go. First question. Uh! Oh my God.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: \"What were you doing the moment you received this application?\" counts for fifty percent of your eligibility.",
        "RORY: Stop.",
        "[Lane walks out of Rory's bedroom]",
        "LANE: I need help.",
        "LORELAI: With what?",
        "RORY: She's writing her drummer-seeks-rock-band ad.",
        "LANE: And it's not reading right to me. Could you guys look it over?",
        "RORY: Let's see \u0096 \"Drummer with strong beat seeks band into the Accelerators, the Adolescents, the Adverts, Agent Orange, the Angelic Upstarts, the Agnostic Front, Ash. . .\" You went alphabetically.",
        "LANE: Seemed tidy.",
        "LORELAI: And a little OCD.",
        "RORY: And a little long.",
        "LANE: I can't make cuts.",
        "RORY: It's three pages, single spaced \u0096 make cuts.",
        "LANE: But this is the cut-down version. I mean, just from the letter A, I excluded AC/DC, the Animals, and A-Ha, footnoted as a guilty pleasure.",
        "RORY: If we can't get through it, no one can.",
        "LANE: Okay.",
        "RORY: Okay.",
        "LANE: I'll try to make cuts, but no guarantees. [goes back into Rory's bedroom]",
        "LORELAI: Okay, personal information. . . state your full name. Better not get that one wrong.",
        "RORY: I'll try.",
        "LORELAI: And nickname, if any.",
        "RORY: That would be Rory.",
        "LORELAI: Or Droopy Drawers.",
        "RORY: That was never my nickname.",
        "LORELAI: Wrong, I called you that as a baby.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: That's right. You had these little OshKosh cords and they were way too big and once at the mall, they fell right down to your knees and I said, \"Whoa, there, Droopy Drawers!\" \u0096 and I'm just afraid if we don't answer everything accurately, the Harvard police will come and hit you with an atlas and say something mean in Latin.",
        "RORY: How would they know that you called me Droopy Drawers?",
        "LORELAI: Well, we could be at a Harvard event and I could slip up and say, \"Pass me a lobster puff, Droopy Drawers,\" and they could hear me, and that'll be that.",
        "RORY: How \u0091bout you don't drink at any of these Harvard events?",
        "LORELAI: Okay, parental information. Mother \u0096 breathtaking.",
        "RORY: I think they just want your name.",
        "LORELAI: Father \u0096 ostracized. Personal statement.",
        "RORY: Oh, the essay \u0096 the big kahuna.",
        "LORELAI: You can evaluate a significant experience that's had an impact on you. How \u0091bout that time your drawers dropped at the mall?",
        "RORY: Enough with the drawers.",
        "LORELAI: Or you can write about a person who has had a significant influence on you.",
        "RORY: You?",
        "LORELAI: Or one of your authors, Faulkner or. . .",
        "RORY: Or Sylvia Plath.",
        "LORELAI: Hm, might send the wrong message.",
        "RORY: The sticking her head in the oven thing?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah. Although she did make her kids a snack first, shows a certain maternal instinct.",
        "[Lane walks out of Rory's bedroom]",
        "LANE: Okay, I just crunched the numbers and at two thousand words and twenty-five cents a word, this stupid ad's gonna cost five hundred dollars! That's five months worth of Minwaxing end tables at my mom's store. I give up.",
        "RORY: No, don't give up. Just cut down your influences to the most important ones, like with David Bowie.",
        "LANE: Gotta have Bowie.",
        "RORY: But do you have to list every album he ever recorded plus your personal rating between one to ten?",
        "LANE: Maybe not.",
        "LORELAI: And what's with Jackson Browne making the list?",
        "LANE: Ah, see, cool people know that he's more than a mellow hippie-dippy folkie, that he actually wrote some of Nico's best songs and was in fact her lover before he bored us with \"Doctor My Eyes.\" That will separate the poseurs from the non-poseurs.",
        "RORY: Wax on, wax off.",
        "LANE: I hate this. [goes back into bedroom]",
        "LORELAI: Okay, what activities interest you?",
        "RORY: All of them except for the sports.",
        "LORELAI: I thought you were the lacrosse kid.",
        "RORY: Mom, just a modicum of seriousness as we do this would be much appreciated.",
        "LORELAI: Hm, so, circle all of them except sports. Oh, they want a picture. How about the one of us sticking our heads through the carved out holes of Johnny Bravo and SpongeBob Squarepants?",
        "RORY: There's the seriousness I crave.",
        "[Lane opens the bedroom door]",
        "LANE: I'm going to have to crank the Ramones if I have to make deep cuts.",
        "[Lane shuts the door, and a second later, music starts blaring from the room]",
        "RORY: We'll move outside.",
        "LORELAI: The outside's contaminated.",
        "[Rory grabs the bottle of cleanser and they walk out the back door]",
        "CUT TO LUKE'S DINER",
        "[Dean and Rory are sitting at a table. Luke refills Rory's coffee mug]",
        "RORY: Thank you.",
        "LUKE: Do they let kids drink coffee before school?",
        "RORY: Why, do you think it might lead to harder stuff? Lattes, cappucinos. . .",
        "LUKE: Forget I asked. [walks away]",
        "RORY: So, what are you doing Saturday?",
        "DEAN: Just my usual chores.",
        "RORY: Your usual chores, John-boy?",
        "DEAN: Well, what else do you call house jobs?",
        "RORY: I call them the stuff you avoid until the Environmental Protection Agency steps in.",
        "DEAN: Why do you ask?",
        "RORY: I thought we could see a movie or something.",
        "DEAN: You're not free.",
        "RORY: How do you know?",
        "DEAN: \u0091Cause you'll be working on your application all weekend.",
        "RORY: No, I'm not.",
        "DEAN: Really?",
        "RORY: It's not due for weeks, and I already have my essay topic picked out.",
        "DEAN: Which is?",
        "RORY: Hillary Clinton.",
        "DEAN: Sounds perfect.",
        "RORY: I know. She's so smart and tough and nobody thought she could win New York but she did and she's doing amazing, and have you heard her speak?",
        "DEAN: Only when you've played me the thousands of hours of C-SPAN footage you taped.",
        "RORY: She's a great speaker, strong and persuasive with a wonderful presence, and even those suits of hers are getting better.",
        "DEAN: I'd include that in the essay.",
        "RORY: Anyhow, now that I have Hillary, all I need is a date for Saturday. Suggestions?",
        "DEAN: You're on.",
        "RORY: Great. Oh, there's my bus. Sip. [sips coffee] Kiss. [they kiss] And bye.",
        "DEAN: Bye.",
        "[Rory exits the diner and runs to catch her bus as Luke walks over to the table]",
        "LUKE: Fast runner.",
        "DEAN: It's the coffee.",
        "LUKE: Not your face?",
        "DEAN: Excuse me?",
        "LUKE: Sorry, just missed my youth for a second. I'm back. Coffee?",
        "[Luke looks out the window and sees Taylor taking photographs of the store next to the diner]",
        "CUT TO CHILTON HALLWAY",
        "[Rory is waiting outside the auditorium while Paris argues with a teacher]",
        "PARIS: Everyone always says that! This is my speaking voice. This is its natural volume! Fine, fine! [walks over to Rory and they walk into the auditorium]",
        "PARIS: Short-sighted morons.",
        "RORY: What now, Paris?",
        "PARIS: We went to all this trouble to set up this stupid seminar. I say we, but let's face it, I did most of the work, and Mr. Hunter won't let me do it the way I want.",
        "RORY: The panelists are up there. We sit across from them and ask questions. What's the problem?",
        "PARIS: It's boring and predictable and done to death. I wanted Charlie Rose.",
        "RORY: To ask the questions?",
        "PARIS: His style. I wanted us sitting at a round table with black backdrops.",
        "RORY: But the audience won't be able to see anything.",
        "PARIS: I was working with the losers in the AV club to project it on a giant video screen. And all Mr. Hunter said was, \"Paris, this isn't the Beatles at Shea Stadium.\" Nice anachronism, huh? Like they had video screens in sixty-three. His references are as topical as his suits.",
        "MR. HUNTER: [on stage] Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention please? We can get this seminar started. I'd like to bring up the organizers of this little event, Paris Gellar and Rory Gilmore.",
        "[There are two tables on the stage. A man and a woman are seated at one of them; Rory and Paris walk on stage and sit at the other]",
        "PARIS: Thank you, Mr. Hunter. Everybody, this is a seminar called \"The Business of Getting In.\" Its goal is to help guide us through the torturous process of applying to, and getting into, the right college. My panelists are Jim Romaine, admissions officer at Princeton University, and Ivy-League college consultant, Rose Samuels. Welcome, panel.",
        "RORY: Yes, welcome.",
        "PARIS: Now, panel, you're addressing a group of kids just beginning the stressful process of applying to college. Question \u0096 what is the biggest mistake a person can make on his or her application? Mr. Romaine?",
        "MR. ROMAINE: Well, forgetting to send it in would be the worst mistake, but perfunctory answers would be high on my list.",
        "PARIS: Explain.",
        "MR. ROMAINE: I'm talking about run of the mill responses, a lack of originality, particularly in the essay category. If I read one more over-adulating piece of prose about Hillary Clinton and her profound influence, my head will explode.",
        "MS. SAMUELS: I hear that. Sometimes a mistake like that comes from writing what one thinks an admission officer wants to read.",
        "MR. ROMAINE: Big mistake.",
        "MS. SAMUELS: And sometimes it's just a lack of original thought.",
        "MR. ROMAINE: Just as big a mistake.",
        "PARIS: Personal anecdote \u0096 when I was twelve and I was writing the first of my trial essays in practice for the day I'd write my real essay, I chose Hillary Clinton. Then I realized every braindead bint in a skirt would be writing about Hillary, but it was good to clear the pipes. Now, what are some other mistakes?",
        "MR. ROMAINE: Well, small thing, but if your printing is bad, that says something we don't like. If your extracurriculars and volunteer activities are too by-the-book, that says something we don't like.",
        "MS. SAMUELS: Yes, those activities should have a personality behind them \u0096 a focus, a direction. I've seen applications where the student has circled every activity listed. Again, you're trying too hard there. One can't be interested in everything.",
        "MR. ROMAINE: They're the ones who've had college paraphernalia on their walls their whole lives.",
        "MS. SAMUELS: Too hungry, it's a little immature.",
        "PARIS: Interesting, interesting. Rory, do you wanna ask a question?",
        "RORY: No.",
        "PARIS: What?",
        "RORY: No, thank you.",
        "PARIS: Okay. So, how early should a student get an application in?",
        "MR. ROMAINE: By the due date. Earlier makes no difference. It's a complete myth that there's a benefit to be derived from early admission. I do think it's important to talk about the interview process. I believe it's an opportunity to weed out the hyper-intense candidate. . .",
        "CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE",
        "[Lorelai and Emily walk into the living room]",
        "EMILY: So, she's meeting you here?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, she had a thing after school, a rumble or something. She said she'd be over after.",
        "EMILY: A rumble?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, a bunch of kids meet in an alley, they pirouette, they pull knives, it's a whole to-do.",
        "EMILY: So she's meeting you here?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, she's meeting us here. Where's Dad?",
        "EMILY: The magazines. [walks away]",
        "LORELAI: That was weird. . .and unresponsive.",
        "[Lorelai walks over to the couch as Emily returns with a stack of magazines]",
        "EMILY: These are college issues of various magazines. I've been collecting them for a couple of months now.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, well, Rory's probably seen all those, but thanks anyway.",
        "EMILY: Have you read these?",
        "LORELAI: No.",
        "EMILY: Well, you should. I've unearthed some shocking statistics. I mean, do you have any idea how hot the competition is to get into a school like Harvard?",
        "LORELAI: Well, yeah, it's very hot. It's one of the top schools in the country.",
        "EMILY: In the world. People from China, Russia, India, children from every country apply to Harvard. There's more competition than ever before.",
        "LORELAI: Really, Mom, I know all this.",
        "EMILY: With the dot-com bust and the job market dwindling and the stock market going up and down like a yo-yo, everyone and his brother knows the best chance for success and financial security is not just to go to college, but to go to a top college.",
        "LORELAI: Thank you, got it, appreciate the info.",
        "EMILY: Every child that applies has the same high grade point average, they've taken the same AP classes, and they're all on the student council.",
        "LORELAI: They're not all that identical.",
        "EMILY: One college admissions officer said that he sometimes puts a random stack of applications in the yes pile and the rest in the no pile because he knows it doesn't make any difference. He doesn't even so much as glance at them.",
        "LORELAI: That does not sound real.",
        "EMILY: And now it's the in thing for young Hollywood celebrities to go to universities. What do they call themselves, the Brat Pack?",
        "LORELAI: About a hundred years ago.",
        "EMILY: They get into wherever they want based on name recognition. I was watching TV and that insipid Kate Hudson was talking about going to a university. If she decides to go to Harvard, she'll get right in over Rory, who we know is more qualified.",
        "LORELAI: How \u0091bout a drink, Mom? You want a drink, \u0091cause I sure do.",
        "EMILY: Lorelai, hold on here. What are we gonna do about this?",
        "LORELAI: Look, there is no we, okay? It's me \u0096 me and Rory \u0096 that's the we. I appreciate your concern and your prodigious research, but it's all gonna be fine. Rory's special.",
        "EMILY: Well, you know that and I know that but those idiots at Harvard may not necessarily know that.",
        "RORY: [calls from hallway] Hello?",
        "LORELAI: Uh, we're in here, honey, and hurry!",
        "[Rory walks into the living room]",
        "RORY: Hi Grandma.",
        "EMILY: Hello Rory. You look flushed.",
        "RORY: I ran from the bus stop, I'm okay. Mom, hey, I've been trying to call you \u0096 can I talk to you for a second?",
        "EMILY: Is something wrong?",
        "RORY: No, I just need to talk to Mom about something, that's all. We'll be quick.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, hon. We'll be back.",
        "CUT TO RICHARD'S STUDY",
        "[Rory and Lorelai walk in]",
        "RORY: I'm not getting into Harvard.",
        "LORELAI: What? Who says?",
        "RORY: Well, I'm completely unprepared, and I have no original thoughts!",
        "LORELAI: No, no, don't blame yourself, it's not you. It's those jerks at Harvard \u0096 I hate them!",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: Well, apparently, it doesn't matter how qualified you are, those lazy-ass admissions officers just take applications and stick it in the yes and no piles without even glancing at them!",
        "RORY: Well, it won't matter because my Hillary Clinton essay will be just like every other girl's Hillary Clinton essay because apparently that's all we can think of. I'm such a hack.",
        "LORELAI: Is it true everyone has the same GPA? How is that possible?",
        "RORY: Because we all take the same classes and we all give the same perfunctory run-of-the-mill responses. And I'm interested in too many things, I have to limit them. I'm gonna circle travel on my application. From now on, that is what I am interested in, travel.",
        "LORELAI: No, no, don't do that, no! Because all those people coming from China and India and God knows where else, they're all nuts for traveling \u0096 that's why they're traveling here! And and jobs are dropping and dot-com bombing and something's acting like a yo-yo, I don't know what but it's not good! And over my dead body is Kate Hudson getting your spot, let me just say that right now!",
        "RORY: Mom, you're freaking out!",
        "LORELAI: Yes, I'm freaking out!",
        "RORY: Well, you can't freak out, I'm freaking out! [cell phone rings] Hello?",
        "PARIS: What the hell did Romaine mean when he was going on about weeding out the hyper-intense in the interview process? He stopped just short of calling me by name, I'm losing it!",
        "RORY: Not now, Paris.",
        "PARIS: I tried to throw the questioning over to you because I was about to heave and you left me hanging so I had to come home and heave.",
        "RORY: I'll talk to you tomorrow, Paris. [hangs up]",
        "PARIS: Wait!",
        "LORELAI: Okay, we gotta calm down here.",
        "RORY: So, set an example.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, I'm human, too.",
        "RORY: My forehead is burning up.",
        "LORELAI: My heart is beating so fast, it's gotta slow down.",
        "RORY: Okay, just. . .let's take a breath.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. This freaking out is not good.",
        "RORY: It sucks.",
        "LORELAI: We can do this. If others can do this, we can do this!",
        "RORY: Well, I'm not so sure anymore.",
        "LORELAI: That is unacceptable!",
        "RORY: Well, I don't wanna accept it.",
        "LORELAI: Then we won't.",
        "RORY: Well, what do we do?",
        "LORELAI: I don't know. We definitely need some sort of perspective.",
        "RORY: I think we need therapy.",
        "LORELAI: And booze! For those of us over twenty-one. Okay, are we calming? Are we less-freaked?",
        "RORY: I'm totally freaked out.",
        "LORELAI: Well, hide it!",
        "RORY: I can't hide it.",
        "LORELAI: Then prepare yourself for an evening of magazine recitations by Emily \"DJ Doom-meister\" Gilmore.",
        "RORY: I'll hide it.",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "[Lorelai is making coffee in the kitchen when the phone rings]",
        "LORELAI: [answers] Hello? . . . No, Lane should be here any minute. Is this about the ad? . . . Well, uh, give me your number and she'll call you back. . . Okay, then, what's the number of the dude whose couch you're sleeping on? . . .Uh! Dude doesn't have a phone? Well, try back later, dude. Thanks. [hangs up] Rory, are you up? If not, get up! [phone rings again] And where's Lane? She's supposed to be fielding these. [answers phone] Hello? No, she's not, may I take a message? [Lane walks in through the back door] Oh, wait a minute \u0096 here she is, hold on. [holds out the phone toward Lane]",
        "LANE: Sorry. [answers phone] This is Lane. [walks out of kitchen]",
