        "OPEN AT ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE",
        "(It's the weekly Friday dinner. Lorelai, Rory and Emily are sitting at the dinner table eating.)",
        "RORY: Grandma, can I have some baby pictures of you and Grandpa?",
        "EMILY: Any particular reason?",
        "RORY: Yeah, we're doing this visual family history project for school.",
        "EMILY: Oh. Well, if it's for school I suppose I could dig something up.",
        "RORY: And I need some of Mom too.",
        "LORELAI: I thought we already had this conversation.",
        "RORY: Yeah, but I don't believe you.",
        "LORELAI: Mother tell her.",
        "EMILY: I don't have any baby pictures of your mother.",
        "LORELAI: Thank you.",
        "RORY: How could you not have any baby pictures of Mom?",
        "EMILY: Because when your mother was seven, I came downstairs and found her burning all of her baby pictures.",
        "R: Why would you do that? I'm sure you were a cute baby.",
        "EMILY: She was. She was very cute.",
        "L: Four, three, two, one.",
        "EMILY: In most respects.",
        "L: Then we have lift off.",
        "R: What does that mean?",
        "L: Nothing.",
        "EMILY: I don't see what the problem is. You certainly grew into it.",
        "R: Grown into what?",
        "EMILY: As a child, your mother had an unusually large head.",
        "L: The best thing about it was that she would tell me constantly. My first complete sentence was, \"Big head want dolly.\"",
        "R: I can't imagine it being that bad.",
        "EMILY: It wasn't. It just affected her balance a little so. . .",
        "L: Okay, can we please talk about something besides my formerly huge head?",
        "R: Are these new chairs Grandma?",
        "EMILY: Why, yes Rory, they are.",
        "LORELAI: They are?",
        "EMILY: I got them from a dealer up in Maine last summer. He just finished restoring them.",
        "LORELAI: They look exactly like the old ones.",
        "RORY: They're nice.",
        "LORELAI: Are you sure they're new?",
        "EMILY: Of course I'm sure. I bought them.",
        "LORELAI: I don't see any difference at all.",
        "EMILY: Well, the arch in the back is higher and they have a completely different leg.",
        "L: Hmm, no difference.",
        "EMILY: Of course I could only get ten of these, so I'm two chairs short of a set.",
        "L: You're telling me.",
        "EMILY: Lorelai, do you realize how rare these chairs are?",
        "L: No.",
        "EMILY: I've searched for three years or them. I've combed every fine antique store on the East Coast and this is all I could find. I blame Peg Mosley.",
        "L: Hm, Peg Mosley. Evil, evil woman.",
        "R: What did Peg Mosley do?",
        "L: She lured these two German children to her gingerbread house and then she tried to eat them. Pass the artichokes please.",
        "EMILY: I made the mistake of telling Peg all my favorite special spots and that woman moved in and completely wiped them out. You can't find a decent Biedermayer hutch in all of Connecticut. I'm desperate for new sources.",
        "R: What about Kim's Antiques?",
        "EMILY: What's Kim's Antiques?",
        "L: Didn't that burn down?",
        "R: My best friend Lane, her parents have this great antiques store in Stars Hollow.",
        "EMILY: Is that so? (To Lorelai) Why haven't you ever told me about it?",
        "L: Oh, I don't know Mom. I guess it just got lost in my big head.",
        "R: Maybe you should come to Stars Hollow and I'll take you there. Like Saturday. You can come see the town.",
        "EMILY: Well, won't you have to study?",
        "R: I can put off studying for one day.",
        "L: I'm working.",
        "EMILY: No one is asking you to do anything Lorelai. This is between Rory and me. I accept your offer Rory. I would love to spend Saturday with you.",
        "R: Great.",
        "L: Well, I'm just sorry that I'm gonna miss it.",
        "EMILY: Eat your artichoke Lorelai.",
        "(Opening credits)",
        "CUT TO LUKE'S DINER",
        "(Rory and Lorelai are sitting at a table. Luke brings their plates to them.)",
        "LUKE: Okay, French toast with bacon crispy. Pancakes, two eggs over easy.",
        "L: Oh.",
        "LUKE: What?",
        "L: You put the eggs on top of the pancakes.",
        "R: Oops.",
        "LUKE: What?",
        "L: Yeah, well, it's like two eyes staring at me. See, I can't eat it like this.",
        "R: Hence the oops.",
        "LUKE: What are you talking about? You always order the same thing.",
        "L: Yeah, but you usually put the eggs on the side so that my breakfast is not ogling me.",
        "LUKE: It's the same food.",
        "L: Hmm, yeah, I need the eggs put on the side.",
        "LUKE: You want a brand new plate.",
        "L: Yes.",
        "LUKE: How about if I take this plate in the back, I take the eggs off the pancakes, I put the same eggs on the side and bring the plate back out. What happens then?",
        "L: Then I can eat my breakfast.",
        "LUKE: It's the same food just a different configuration.",
        "L: I won't know that.",
        "LUKE: I'm gonna take the plate in the back.",
        "(Luke picks up the plate and walks away.)",
        "L: So what time does the judgmental express arrive?",
        "R: Grandma gets here at noon.",
        "L: Hmm.",
        "R: Are you sure you won't do lunch?",
        "L: Oh no, I can't, lunch is bad.",
        "(Rachel walks over to the table.)",
        "RACHEL: Lorelai, you're here. Good. Don't move.",
        "L: I won't.",
        "(Rachel walks away)",
        "R: What are you doing at lunch?",
        "L: Oh, I have very important things to do.",
        "R: Like what?",
        "L: Well, at noon I have to not have lunch with my mother.",
        "R: Very nice.",
        "(Rachel walks back with a pile of photographs.)",
        "RACHEL: So I'm developing my pictures from the Firelight Festival. Some amazing stuff. And I'm thinking maybe there's a book here, faces of small town America. . .",
        "L: Ah, you should feel safe, you don't live near these people.",
        "RACHEL: Exactly. And the very last shot on my roll was this.",
        "(Rachel hands Lorelai a picture of Luke and Lorelai sitting on a bench.)",
        "L: Wow. When did you take this?",
        "RACHEL: When you weren't looking.",
        "(Luke walks over with Lorelai's plate.)",
        "LUKE: What's that?",
        "L: Oh, it's a picture of us.",
        "LUKE: Us?",
        "RORY: Rachel took it.",
        "RACHEL: At the Firelight Festival.",
        "LUKE: Oh, sure, yeah. (hands Lorelai the plate.) So, uh, here's your plate, no eyes.",
        "L: Thank you.",
        "RACHEL: Do you wear contacts?",
        "L: Me? No.",
        "RACHEL: God, you've got amazing eyes. Doesn't she?",
        "LUKE: Oh, yeah. Sure, I guess. . . I mean, they're, you know, placed good. . . . symmetrical. I'm gonna get some more coffee.",
        "RACHEL: Yeah.",
        "(Rory hands Lorelai a photo of an old building.)",
        "R: Oh wow. Mom, look at this.",
        "L: What is that?",
        "RACHEL: It's an old abandoned inn I ran across when I was exploring the other day.",
        "L: This is Dragonfly. I totally forgot about this place.",
        "RACHEL: Well, it doesn't look like it's been operational in years.",
        "R: Look at all the trees. It's pretty. Oh, I'm buzzing. (takes her pager out of her pocket)",
        "L: What have I said about buzzing in public?",
        "R: It's Lane. 911. That's trig. Gotta go.",
        "L: Bye. Take a . . . yeah.",
        "R: Bye Rachel.",
        "RACHEL: Bye. (Rory leaves.) See, that is one really not annoying kid.",
        "L: Yes, she really is not.",
        "RACHEL: See, I might consider doing the whole mom thing if I could be guaranteed that I could get one just like her.",
        "L: Oh you can, you just have to go to Sears. God, where is this again?",
        "RACHEL: Uh, it's kind of behind the mill. You go over the little footbridge with the mean duck family living under it.",
        "L: Yes, the Armbrusters. Wow, it's really amazing.",
        "RACHEL: Do you want to see it?",
        "L: What?",
        "RACHEL: The inn. I'm gonna head out that way in a little while.",
        "L: Oh, well. . .",
        "RACHEL: Come on, finish your breakfast. I'll drive us out there.",
        "(Luke walks to the table carrying a coffee pot.)",
        "LUKE: Drive her out where?",
        "RACHEL: Oh, Lorelai and I are going to cruise the docks.",
        "L: Yeah, we're gonna see how many sailors we can get to tattoo our names on their butts.",
        "RACHEL: So what do you think?",
        "L: Well, I have to check in at the inn first.",
        "RACHEL: Well that's okay. Good. I'll pick you up there.",
        "L: Okay. Good.",
        "(Rachel walks away.)",
        "LUKE: So what was all about?",
        "L: Oh nothing. We're just gonna go check out this old inn Rachel found.",
        "LUKE: Hmm.",
        "L: What?",
        "LUKE: Nothing. I didn't know you guys were friends.",
        "L: Hm, well we're not really friends. I mean, I don't know her that well. But we're just hanging out. She seems really great.",
        "LUKE: Oh yeah, she is. She's great. She's just, you know, a lot different from you.",
        "L: 'Cause I'm not really great?",
        "LUKE: No, you're great. Just in a different way.",
        "L: In a not really great way?",
        "LUKE: That's not what I meant. The two of you are just completely different people. Both great, but I'm just a little surprised that, you know, you're different types of greatness are, you know, melding and you're comfortably great together.",
        "L: Is this bothering you?",
        "LUKE: This conversation, yes.",
        "L: No. Um, the idea of Rachel and I hanging out together. Is there some reason that's weird for you or something?",
        "LUKE: Why would it be?",
        "L: No reason I can think of.",
        "LUKE: Okay, well then it's not weird.",
        "L: Good, well I was just checking.",
        "LUKE: Okay, well then, you checked.",
        "L: Okay. So are you gonna be pouring that coffee anytime or. . .",
        "LUKE: Oh.",
        "L: I'm glad it's not weird though because . . (Luke overflows her coffee cup.) . . . that would be bad.",
        "LUKE: Oh, I'll get a rag.",
        "CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN",
        "(Lorelai is talking to a group from Japan, while a translator repeats everything she says in Japanese.)",
        "LORELAI: Welcome Ichiro Motors to the Independence Inn. So the dining room is right through there. And breakfast is served 6 to 11:30, although our chef is an amazing overachiever and she'll be happy to prepare you anything you want any time of day. Now your itinerary for the conference will be in each of your rooms. And if you have any questions at all, just please feel free to ask, uh . . . (gestures toward Michel at the counter.)",
        "MICHEL: No. (Michel walks away)",
        "LORELAI: . . . . somebody else. Not him. Okay, so ask Roger. Roger will be happy to help you. Thanks so much.",
        "(Lorelai walks away from the group. She sees Rune sitting on a couch in the lobby. She walks past him hiding her face.)",
        "CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN",
        "(Sookie is mixing something. Lorelai walks in.)",
        "L: Rune is in the lobby.",
        "SOOKIE: Lorelai, hello. I made some coffee.",
        "L: Rune is in the lobby.",
        "SOOKIE: Oh, I also made those little orange glazed muffins you like with warm cinnamon butter.",
        "L: Sookie, Rune is in the lobby.",
        "SOOKIE: Uh huh.",
        "L: Why?",
        "SOOKIE: Your muffin's getting cold.",
        "L: My muffin's fine. My muffin wants to know what the fruitcake is doing in the lobby.",
        "SOOKIE: Well, he's staying with Jackson.",
        "L: Again?",
        "SOOKIE: Still.",
        "L: I thought he was only here for a weekend.",
        "SOOKIE: Yes, the lost weekend.",
        "L: Okay. Explain Yoko, because he's out there with the normal people and he's going to scare them",
        "SOOKIE: He won't leave.",
        "L: Jackson's house?",
        "SOOKIE: Yes. Jackson's house. He won't leave and it's driving me crazy.",
        "L: Well tell Jackson to kick him out.",
        "SOOKIE: Jackson won't do it.",
        "L: Why not?",
        "SOOKIE: Because he says it's family and somehow he feels responsible for him.",
        "L: Well, okay yes, but has Jackson met him? I think that would change his mind.",
        "SOOKIE: Apparently, Rune had a rough childhood. His parents don't talk to him, his brothers and sisters don't talk to him, no one talks to him.",
        "L: So, then what's wrong with Jackson?",
        "SOOKIE: I don't know. But he's determined to stand by him and I have to respect his decision.",
        "L: Well, that part I can understand.",
        "SOOKIE: Good.",
        "L: But the part I can't understand is what is Rune doing in the lobby?",
        "SOOKIE: Yeah, well, I don't . . .",
        "(Jackson walks through the door carry a crate of berries and a jar of jam.)",
        "JACKSON: Lorelai.",
        "L: Jackson.",
        "JACKSON: These are for you.",
        "L: For me?",
        "(Sookie stands behind Lorelai and starts waving a spoon back and forth to get Jackson's attention. Jackson doesn't notice.)",
        "JACKSON: Yeah and I also brought some of my raspberry peach jam. I think you're gonna like it. Put it on ice cream.",
        "L: Okay.",
        "JACKSON: Or take a graham cracker, spread a little on it, break up a chocolate bar, throw it in the broiler for a couple of minutes, and you're gonna be singing show tunes all evening.",
        "L: Must be some good jam.",
        "JACKSON: Yeah, well, it's just my way of saying thanks for helping out Rune.",
        "L: Thanks for helping out Rune.",
        "SOOKIE: Okay, I'm doing the spoon signal.",
        "JACKSON: Oh, I didn't notice.",
        "SOOKIE: Okay, I'm waving around like an idiot here.",
        "JACKSON: So you haven't. . .",
        "SOOKIE: No.",
        "JACKSON: Ah.",
        "SOOKIE: Yeah.",
        "JACKSON: So I should . . .",
        "SOOKIE: Good idea.",
        "JACKSON: Right. Um, enjoy the jam. (Jackson leaves)",
        "L: Well, uh, would you mind explaining the thank you jam.",
        "SOOKIE: Well, I was supposed to ask you something about Rune.",
        "L: Like what?",
        "SOOKIE: Well, he just not too long ago lost his job.",
        "L: Oh, attitude problem?",
        "SOOKIE: Something like that.",
        "L: Uh huh.",
        "(Lorelai starts eating the jar of jam with a spoon.)",
        "SOOKIE: Anyway, when he lost his job, he couldn't pay his rent so then he got evicted. None of this was known to us when he came to stay with Jackson. I mean, but this is the situation. So I was thinking that if he could get another job and then he could save up some money and afford his own place and move out, and then I wouldn't end up stabbing him in the neck with a grapefruit spoon.",
        "L: Ouch.",
        "SOOKIE: Its gonna happen.",
        "L: You want me to give him a job?",
        "SOOKIE: Nothing important.",
        "L: Oh good, 'cause I was gonna put him in charge of legal.",
        "SOOKIE: I know it's a lot to ask, but I can't think of anything else.",
        "L: What can he do?",
        "SOOKIE: Lots of things! He's always fiddling around, using screws. Once I saw him use a hammer.",
        "L: A hammer?",
        "SOOKIE: I bet he could be a handyman. You are always looking for a good handyman.",
        "L: Well I couldn't pay him very much.",
        "SOOKIE: Well, that's okay. Maybe he could just work for, uh, room and board.",
        "L: You want him to live here?",
        "SOOKIE: No! Well, what about the old potting shed?",
        "L: The old potting shed? That's where Rory and I lived when she was a baby. It has memories and little rosebud wallpaper. I don't want Boo Radley touching my rosebud wallpaper.",
        "SOOKIE: The job is enough. You're right. He can save up money and eventually move out. I'll just have to deal with it.",
        "L: The potting shed's fine.",
        "SOOKIE: Really?",
        "L: Yes.",
        "SOOKIE: I love you!",
        "L: But I swear to God Sookie, the minute the guests start complaining or disappearing, he's out of there.",
        "SOOKIE: More than fair.",
        "L: Mm, it's really good jam.",
        "(Lorelai hands Sookie the jar of jam.)",
        "SOOKIE: Yeah. It is isn't it?",
        "(Lorelai leaves)",
        "CUT TO OUTSIDE LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "(Rory is sitting on the porch. Emily pulls up the driveway. Rory walks to her car.)",
        "R: Grandma.",
        "EMILY: Rory, hello. What a lovely day to. . . ugh. (Emily's heel gets caught in the grass.) I guess putting in a walkway never occurred to your mother.",
        "R: Oh actually it occurs to her every day on the way to work. Here. (Rory helps pull her heel out of the grass.)",
        "EMILY: Thank you.",
        "(They start walking towards the house.)",
        "CUT TO INSIDE LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "(Rory and Emily walk in through the front door.)",
        "R: Are your shoes okay?",
        "EMILY: They're fine. Just a little muddy that's all.",
        "R: Here give 'em. I'll clean them for you.",
        "EMILY: Oh you don't have to do that.",
        "(Rory takes the shoes and walks into the kitchen. Emily follows.)",
        "R: My mom found this great shoe cleaner. It's gets out pretty much anything. Do you want something to drink, there should be some iced tea in the fridge.",
        "EMILY: Iced tea would be nice. (opens fridge) Oh my god. There's nothing in here.",
        "(Rory pours some cleaner on a cloth and starts wiping off Emily's shoes.)",
        "R: I know, it's a little sparse.",
        "EMILY: It's the Grapes of Wrath.",
        "R: Don't worry. We eat fine.",
        "EMILY: No food, no drink. Do you at least have plates?",
        "R: Yes, we have plates.",
        "(Emily pulls a plate out the cabinet.)",
        "EMILY: There are women in bikinis on them.",
        "R: The original Charlie's Angels. It took us years to get a complete set. You can find the Kate Jackson's and the Shelly Hack's pretty easily. Even the Cheryl Ladd's. But the Farrah Fawcett's and the Jacklyn Smith's are a little harder to come by, but still accessible. The real trick however is to find the Tanya Roberts. We have three.",
        "EMILY: You have three Tanya Roberts?",
        "R: Yup.",
        "EMILY: And I was worried, silly me. (She puts the plate away) How are you doing with those shoes?",
        "R: All done. (hands Emily the shoes)",
        "EMILY: That's amazing. What is that you used?",
        "R: I don't know. We got if off one of those late night TV ads. Apparently it also gets rust off nails and hinges, waxes your car perfectly, and weatherproofs windows and doors.",
        "EMILY: Well, isn't that nice?",
        "R: Okay, about today. I think I should just give you the grand tour of the town. So we can start by walking to Kim's Antiques, which takes us by all the good sites.",
        "EMILY: Well, uh, Rory, I don't think I wore the right shoes for the grand tour. Why don't we just drive?",
        "R: You can borrow some of my mom's shoes.",
        "EMILY: Uh, no, I don't think so. Rory hold on a minute.",
        "R: Grandma, you will be missing the true Stars Hollow experience if you don't walk. Trust me.",
        "(Rory starts walking upstairs)",
        "EMILY: All right, but I won't wear anything with rhinestones or zebra stripes or anything that has batteries or that sings or make animal noises or moves on its own.",
        "R: Grandma, I got it.",
        "CUT TO DRAGONFLY",
        "(Lorelai and Rachel are standing in front of an old, rundown building.)",
        "LORELAI: Must have been something when it was all fixed up and nice.",
        "RACHEL: Can I ask what the fascination with this place is?",
        "L: Oh, well, me and my friend Sookie, we've been kind of toying with the idea of opening our own place together.",
        "RACHEL: Really?",
        "L: Yeah. I mean someday, obviously not now. We're still saving up.",
        "RACHEL: Are you close?",

        "R (to Lane): Uh, N'sync or 98 degrees?",
        "LANE: What kind of sick joke is this?",

        "R: You mean the Backstreet Boys?",

        "LUKE: I'll bet you that's exactly what she does.",
        "L: Well, let's say that is what she does. Don't you think there's the teensiest possibility that if Rachel leaves Stars Hollow this time its because she thinks you don't want her to stay?",
        "LUKE: Are you guys talking about me?",
        "L: No . . . Yes.",
        "LUKE: Okay, I don't mind if you hang out with her, but you will not talk about me.",

        "L: Well, I don't know exactly what's going on in Rachel's head because I'm not a Vulcan, but from the way she talks about you and the way she smiles when your name comes up, I'm pretty sure that she's serious about staying in Stars Hollow this time.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, let me guess. Rachel told you she wanted to put down roots, that she's serious this time, that she's tired of the road, and realizes what's lacking in her nomadic existence.",
        "L: She didn't use the phrase nomadic existence, but basically yes, that's what she said.",

        "L: I'm sorry. I missed the checkered flag, when did the argument start?",
        "EMILY: Is it because it's not a shack in the woods? Or is it the proximity to me that's making it so uncomfortable for you?",

        "EMILY: You hated us that much?",
        "L: What?",

        "L: Who uses the word hobo anymore?",
        "EMILY: I saw it. I saw that horrible little pit you so proudly ran to. I saw what you chose over your own family. You would've lived in the gutter, in the street, it a cardboard box, anywhere as long as you didn't have to be near us, isn't that true?",
        "L: Mom. .",

        "L: Yeah seriously, the other day I caught myself doing a \"9 and 4.\"",
        "R: Mom. .",
        "L: Well, if left uncorrected, that can only lead to a \"6 and 12\", or worse yet, an \"8 and 11\", which is not only dangerous but damn uncomfortable.",
        "R: Talk please.",
        "L: I just wish sometimes that certain things could be different.",
        "R: Like what?",
        "L: Like, um, wouldn't it be great if once, just once, I could make my mother hear me. I mean really hear me even if it was just for one second.",
        "R: Are you talking about the room?",
        "L: The room, the potting shed, my entire life after age 6.",
        "R: It's my fault.",
        "L: How is it your fault?",
        "R: I shouldn't have taken her there.",

        "R: I just thought if she saw how we lived and how pretty it was with the lake and the swans. . .",
        "L: That she'd do a happy dance?",
        "R: That she'd feel included and then maybe . .",
        "L: The whole me running away thing wouldn't be such a big deal? Oh honey, me running away from them is always gonna be a big deal. There is nothing you can do to change that.",
        "R: Can I ask you a question?",
        "L: Yes, I would date Steven Tyler.",
        "R: Can I ask you a question whose answer wouldn't horrify me?",
        "L: Oh, go ahead.",
        "R: Do you think you and Grandma will ever be able to talk about all the things you've gone through?",
        "L: No.",
        "R: You didn't even consider it.",
        "L: I'm sorry. . . . No.",
        "R: Why?",
        "L: Because it would just end badly.",
        "R: It doesn't have to.",
        "L: It would be like the first 15 minutes of Saving Private Ryan but at least those guys got to be in France.",
        "R: You've never tried.",
        "L: Oh no, that's not true. I have tried. I have tried my whole life. But my mother and I, we speak a different language. I talk, I think I'm being clear, and all she hears is 'Blah blah blah Ginger.'",
        "R: But if you won't talk and she won't listen, then how is anything ever gonna change?",

        "L: Oh that's great. You got a drawer.",
        "RACHEL: And a set of keys.",
        "L: Well you can put the keys in the drawer.",

        "L: We'll build a new kitchen Sookie.",
        "SOOKIE: I'll need plenty of ventilation. And an area for an outdoor fireplace for barbecues. Plus storage. Where do these people put anything? Ooh! And a pantry. And a canning room. And I'd love to smoke our own meats.",
