        "OPEN AT LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "[A bunch of catalogs are spread on the kitchen table, and Lorelai is going through them as Rory walks out of her bedroom]",
        "RORY: Morning.",
        "LORELAI: Morning.",
        "RORY: Wow, someone woke up in project mode today.",
        "LORELAI: I'm like the army, baby. I get more done before nine o'clock in the morning than others get done all day.",
        "RORY: Well, as long as you don't abandon it mid-project.",
        "LORELAI: I do not do that.",
        "RORY: Make your own seashell candles.",
        "LORELAI: Aw, not fair.",
        "RORY: The place smelled like melted crayons for three weeks.",
        "LORELAI: This is different.",
        "RORY: Fine, what's the project?",
        "LORELAI: This is a pile of every catalog we have received for the last three months.",
        "RORY: Okay.",
        "LORELAI: I have gathered them all together, and I will now proceed to call all the companies that are sending us duplicates and tell them to stop.",
        "RORY: That's very environmental of you.",
        "LORELAI: It's getting ridiculous. We get, like, eight of some of these.",
        "RORY: You're kidding.",
        "LORELAI: Check this out. [picks up a stack of catalogs] This is a stack of identical catalogs mailed to Lorelai Gilmore, Rory Gilmore, Lorelai Rory Gilmore, Lorelai V. Gilmore, Lorelai Victoria Gilmore, Lorelai Gilmo, Lorelai Gil, and Squeegy Beckinheim.",
        "RORY: How'd that get in there?",
        "LORELAI: I once told a store my name was Squeegy Beckinheim just to see how many catalogs they would sell my name to, and apparently my name is to catalog companies what Brooke Shields' picture is to Chinese restaurants.",
        "RORY: How many?",
        "LORELAI: Ten.",
        "RORY: Wow.",
        "LORELAI: Including one we were already getting seven catalogs from.",
        "RORY: So apparently you made the problem worse.",
        "LORELAI: Unintentionally.",
        "[Rory reads the label on another catalog]",
        "RORY: This one is addressed to Tookie Clothespin.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, I forgot my code name at the second store I tested, so I told them it was Tookie Clothespin.",
        "RORY: Which means we get even more catalogs.",
        "LORELAI: Again, it was unintentional.",
        "RORY: When you start a forest fire unintentionally, it's still your fault.",
        "LORELAI: You're putting calling myself Squeegy Beckinheim and Tookie Clothespin on a level with starting a forest fire?",
        "RORY: It's killing trees.",
        "LORELAI: You're depressing me now.",
        "RORY: Well, get on the phone and stop the madness. That'll cheer you up.",
        "LORELAI: I need coffee.",
        "RORY: There's more coffee.",
        "LORELAI: I should get ready, too.",
        "RORY: You're stopping mid-project.",
        "LORELAI: I'm bored.",
        "RORY: Then don't start these projects.",
        "LORELAI: I promise I'll finish. I just wanna check on the seashells.",
        "RORY: These catalogs will be sitting here forever.",
        "LORELAI: No, they won't. They're biodegradable.",
        "RORY: Come on, I'll call half, you call half, okay?",
        "LORELAI: Okay.",
        "RORY: Okay.",
        "LORELAI: You do yours first, then I'll do mine.",
        "RORY: Hey!",
        "LORELAI: We only have one phone. You're young. You'll dial faster. [leaves room]",
        "RORY: Squeegy!",

        "CUT TO MISS PATTY'S STUDIO",
        "[There's a town meeting going on]",
        "TAYLOR: The bottom line is that too many birds are landing atop the street lights and relieving themselves on helpless passersby. And I dare say that some of these birds seem to be doing it on purpose.",
        "BABETTE: You get dumped on, Taylor?",
        "TAYLOR: It's not just me. . .",
        "LUKE: Hey, if anybody has a picture of Taylor getting dumped on, I'll pay top dollar.",
        "KIRK: I'll check the internet.",
        "MISS PATTY: Taylor, all animals have to. . .you know. How are you gonna stop birds from doing that?",
        "TAYLOR: Easy. Put sharp metal spikes on the top of the fixtures, then when they land, pow \u0096 they're shish-kabobs.",
        "RORY: That's cruel.",
        "BABETTE: You can't do that.",
        "ANDREW: I'd rather have bird crap fall on my head.",
        "LORELAI: There it is \u0096 our new town slogan.",
        "RORY: I like it.",
        "LORELAI: I see coffee mugs, T-shirts.",
        "RORY: Don't forget stuffed shish-kabobbed birds.",
        "LORELAI: That moan when you squeeze them.",
        "[a man enters through the large sliding door]",
        "JESUS: Excuse me.",
        "TAYLOR: May I help you, sir?",
        "JESUS: Yes, I was looking for. . .ah, there she is. . .uh, Patricia.",
        "LORELAI: Patricia. . .well, well, well.",
        "EVERYONE: Woooooooo!",
        "MISS PATTY: Now stop it.",
        "JESUS: Are you ready?",
        "MISS PATTY: I'm right in the middle of something, Jesus, but I'll be right out. Patience.",
        "JESUS: Okay. [walks out]",
        "TAYLOR: Now, as we were saying. . .",
        "BABETTE: Who's the fox, Patty?",
        "TAYLOR: Excuse me.",
        "MISS PATTY: I met him at a funeral. Great guy, good dancer, Latin. . .",
        "EVERYONE: Wooooooo!",
        "TAYLOR: People, order please.",
        "LORELAI: He better treat you right, this guy.",
        "BABETTE: Yeah, how well do you know him?",
        "MISS PATTY: Well, I just met him.",
        "KIRK: I could look him up on the internet.",
        "TAYLOR: People, please! Now, due to the lack of response, we'll hold off on the bird spikes.",
        "LUKE: Good.",
        "LORELAI: Let Miss Patty's date begin.",
        "[Babette hands Patty a camera]",
        "BABETTE: It's a digital. I want a full visual account.",
        "TAYLOR: Hold it. There's one more issue that must be addressed before we can adjourn. All right. Now, that weird, taciturn fellow who's always walking around with his backpack has put in an absurd request to stage a protest in the town square.",
        "LORELAI: The town loner?",
        "LUKE: That guy still lives around here?",
        "BABETTE: Somewhere in the hills, right?",
        "LUKE: I thought he was long gone.",
        "ANDREW: No, he came into the bookstore a couple times last month, never said a word.",
        "MISS PATTY: He's a bit creepy.",
        "TAYLOR: Very creepy.",
        "LORELAI: But he's our Boo Radley, and we don't have a Boo Radley, unless you count the troubadour or Pete the pizza guy or the guy who talks to mailboxes.",
        "RORY: Well, I think the point is that every town needs as many Boo Radleys as they can get.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, that's my point.",
        "MISS PATTY: What's he protesting, Taylor?",
        "TAYLOR: Well, that's not indicated here, but it doesn't matter, because protesting is not allowed in the town square, period. It's un-American.",
        "LUKE: You mean like the Revolutionary War?",
        "BABETTE: And Rosa Parks?",
        "TAYLOR: That's different. They were against the British and buses. No one likes the British or buses.",
        "[Jesus walks in again]",
        "MISS PATTY: Yes, dear, what is it?",
        "JESUS: Oh, I'm sorry, I thought I heard my name.",
        "MISS PATTY: No, he said buses, dear, not Jesus.",
        "JESUS: Sounded like Jesus. [leaves]",
        "TAYLOR: Could this meeting be more disrupted?",
        "LORELAI: I could do a soft shoe.",
        "RORY: Yeah, while I pound out a beat on the bongos.",
        "BABETTE: Ooh, that sounds like fun!",
        "MISS PATTY: I got bongos in the back.",
        "TAYLOR: Seeing as how our attention spans are gnat-like tonight, as town Selectman I am refusing the town loner's request to protest and I am adjourning this meeting.",
        "LORELAI: She's all yours, Jesus!",
        "LUKE: We got nothing of substance done in this meeting.",
        "LORELAI: And the tradition stands.",
        "[People start to leave; Lorelai, Luke, and Rory walk out together]",
        "LORELAI: Hey, what do you know about this town loner guy?",
        "LUKE: Same as everyone. Just kind of skulks around with that backpack, never smiles.",
        "LORELAI: Does he also make cheeseburgers and secretly harbor a desire to wear a backwards baseball cap?",
        "LUKE: What?",
        "LORELAI: [sings] They're cousins, identical cousins. . .",
        "LUKE: Stop it.",
        "[Jess drives by in a beat-up car]",
        "LORELAI: Well. . . look who's back behind the wheel. Lovely.",
        "RORY: Mom, I'm gonna get going. I've got some studying to do.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, babe. I'll catch up with you.",
        "[Rory leaves]",
        "LORELAI: When did Jess get a car?",
        "LUKE: Oh, uh. . .recently.",
        "LORELAI: Where'd he get it?",
        "LUKE: He got it from a guy around here, at a place.",
        "LORELAI: A guy at a place?",
        "LUKE: Yeah.",
        "LORELAI: You had no idea he had a car, did you?",
        "LUKE: Not in the least.",
        "LORELAI: Ah, way to have a handle on things, Luke.",
        "LUKE: Well, he doesn't share a lot with me, you know? And he's got a license. What can I do?",
        "LORELAI: Stop him before he kills.",
        "LUKE: He's not gonna kill anyone.",
        "LORELAI: He's got a bad track record with cars.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, I know, okay? I'm not exactly thrilled with this.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. I'm sorry. It's your thing. I'll just butt out now.",
        "LUKE: Where'd he get the money?",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "LUKE: For the car. Where'd he get it?",
        "LORELAI: I don't know. Working at the diner?",
        "LUKE: I can barely afford a car on the money I get working at the diner.",
        "LORELAI: Maybe it was a gift from someone. . .who doesn't know it's gone yet.",
        "LUKE: Thanks.",
        "LORELAI: I'm helpful, aren't I?",
        "LUKE: Bye.",
        "LORELAI: Bye.",
        "[Lorelai leaves; Luke walks over to Jess]",
        "LUKE: Hey.",
        "JESS: Hey.",
        "LUKE: So. . .you got a car.",
        "JESS: Motor Trend's not gonna be giving it any awards, but it'll get me from point A to point B.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, I guess it'll get you around. So, uh. . .where'd you get the money for it?",
        "JESS: Mugged an old lady.",
        "LUKE: Jess.",
        "JESS: It didn't cost that much.",
        "LUKE: What's not much?",
        "JESS: Less than a lot?",
        "LUKE: Jess, where did you get the money?",
        "JESS: You know that hash you sling at the diner? I scrape it off the plates in the back. Remember I work for you?",
        "LUKE: Yeah, I know you do.",
        "JESS: Okay, then.",
        "LUKE: I also know I don't pay you enough to buy the car.",
        "JESS: I saved up my pennies and I bought the car from Gypsy. She gave me a good deal. That's how I got the car.",
        "LUKE: Okay, so you bought a car. Now, the price of the car is just one small thing. It's just the beginning.",
        "JESS: Oh, yeah?",
        "LUKE: Did you take the additional expenses into account?",
        "JESS: Like. . .",
        "LUKE: Insurance?",
        "JESS: I'm in good hands.",
        "LUKE: Liability, uninsured motorist?",
        "JESS: All the paperwork's in the glove compartment. Feel free to check it out.",
        "LUKE: Money for gas?",
        "JESS: You mean this didn't come with a never empty magical tank?",
        "LUKE: Jess.",
        "JESS: I factored that in.",
        "LUKE: You're gonna have repairs.",
        "JESS: Yeah, and I can fix most of them myself and save up for the rest. Plus, I'm gonna make sure to replace the oil every couple months.",
        "LUKE: Right, I bet you didn't think of that, the oil. That costs money.",
        "JESS: I'm the one that brought it up. You're the one that didn't think of it.",
        "LUKE: No, but. . .I just. . .",
        "JESS: Sign this. [hands him a piece of paper]",
        "LUKE: The registration?",
        "JESS: I'm still a minor.",
        "LUKE: I don't have a pen.",
        "[Jess hands him a pen]",
        "LUKE: I guess it's okay that someone else's name is crossed out on it and that yours it written in.",
        "JESS: Yup.",
        "LUKE: Just checking. [signs it and hands it back]",
        "JESS: Thanks. I'm glad we had this talk.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, same here.",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "[Rory is studying on the couch as Lorelai walks through the front door with the mail]",
        "LORELAI: Hello!",
        "RORY: I'm in here!",
        "LORELAI: Wow, you beat me home by two minutes and your nose is already in the books.",
        "RORY: I can go from zero to studying in less than sixty seconds.",
        "LORELAI: Very impressive. Mail call. [hands Rory a piece of mail]",
        "RORY: What's this?",
        "LORELAI: Mortgage payment. You mind picking it up this month sweetie, baby, cookie, honey?",
        "RORY: No, not at all.",
        "LORELAI: It's just something addressed to you.",
        "[Rory opens it]",
        "RORY: It's an invitation.",
        "LORELAI: Hm.",
        "RORY: [reads it] Oh.",
        "LORELAI: An invitation to what? Oh, is it the White House again? Those boys never give up.",
        "RORY: It's to Sherry's baby shower.",
        "LORELAI: Who?",
        "RORY: Sherry. Sherry Tinsdale. Dad's Sherry?",
        "LORELAI: You're kidding.",
        "RORY: It's at her and Dad's house on Sunday.",
        "LORELAI: Wow, that is very weird. We haven't had contact with Christopher in months. She must know we're on the outs with him, right?",
        "RORY: Yeah, but she may not know how on the outs.",
        "LORELAI: Well, zero contact is maximum on the outs.",
        "RORY: Yeah. . .although there may have been some.",
        "LORELAI: Some what?",
        "RORY: Some contact.",
        "LORELAI: Oh. . .you've been in contact with Christopher?",
        "RORY: Yeah, I'm sorry.",
        "LORELAI: On, no, hon, don't apologize. You've always been totally free to talk to him whenever you want. I've told you that. I mean, he's your dad, right? So don't apologize.",
        "RORY: Okay, I take the apology back.",
        "LORELAI: I think it's good you've been talking to him. It is a little weird you didn't tell me, though.",
        "RORY: Yeah, sorry.",
        "LORELAI: Will you stop apologizing?",
        "RORY: Even when I feel like I should apologize, I can't apologize?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, it's a little annoying.",
        "RORY: Sorry.",
        "LORELAI: Rory.",
        "RORY: I'm just trying to lighten the mood here.",
        "LORELAI: The mood is light. I just hate that you thought you had to hide something like that from me.",
        "RORY: I just kind of felt like I was betraying you or something.",
        "LORELAI: Well, you weren't.",
        "RORY: I know that now.",
        "LORELAI: So, how much contact have you had with him?",
        "RORY: Not tons. He emailed me a month or so ago, I emailed him back, and now we occasionally talk on the phone.",
        "LORELAI: Does he ever ask about me?",
        "RORY: What answer will freak you out the least?",
        "LORELAI: The honest one.",
        "RORY: Yes, he asks about you because Dad will always care for you very much, you know that. Do you want me to say hello for you next time we talk?",
        "LORELAI: No.",
        "RORY: Fine. [holds up invitation] What should I do about this?",
        "LORELAI: It's your call.",
        "RORY: I guess being in Dad's world automatically means being in Sherry's.",
        "LORELAI: And it is your little half brother or sister she's carrying.",
        "RORY: I know, it's weird.",
        "LORELAI: Sort of a good reason to make some connection with her.",
        "RORY: Yeah, but it's gonna be one of those brunchy quichey things where I don't know anyone, and it's all the way in Boston.",
        "LORELAI: I'll drive you there if you want.",
        "RORY: Really?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, I'll do some Boston shopping while you quiche it.",
        "RORY: And we can set up some sort of SOS signal that I can page you with if I want to bail early?",
        "LORELAI: Sure.",
        "RORY: What should the SOS signal be?",
        "LORELAI: How about. . .SOS?",
        "RORY: Perfect.",
        "LORELAI: So you're going.",
        "RORY: I guess I'm going.",
        "LORELAI: Good, I think you've made the right decision.",
        "RORY: So do I. And I shouldn't have hid that I'm talking to Dad. I'm really s\u0096",
        "LORELAI: Ah!",
        "RORY: Starving.",
        "LORELAI: I'll get some ice cream.",
        "CUT TO LUKE'S DINER",
        "[Luke is behind the counter as Jess walks down from upstairs]",
        "LUKE: You're up early.",
        "JESS: I got a few errands to run.",
        "LUKE: You got time before school?",
        "JESS: I got wheels.",
        "LUKE: Right, right, you got wheels. [Jess takes a donut from the display] Lid.",
        "JESS: By the way, I owe you ten bucks.",
        "LUKE: When did I loan you ten bucks?",
        "JESS: Last night.",
        "LUKE: I wasn't here last night.",
        "JESS: You're always here, Uncle Luke \u0096 in my heart.",
        "LUKE: You took money out of the register",
        "JESS: I'm going to the bank now. You'll get it back today.",
        "LUKE: I told you a hundred times, do not take money out of the register.",
        "JESS: Gotta run.",
        "LUKE: Lid.",
        "[Jess leaves, and Luke watches him out the window. Kirk, sitting at a table, clears his throat]",
        "LUKE: Oh, uh, what can I get you, Kirk?",
        "KIRK: Patty melt and a coke.",
        "LUKE: You want the melt cut into squares or stars today?",
        "KIRK: Half and half?",
        "LUKE: Okay, coming right up.",
        "KIRK: Thanks. [looks out the window at Jess' car] Man, that car's a honey. Duel piston cams, diplex overdrive with maximum torque, sixteen liter side by side, firing three on one. . . sweet.",
        "LUKE: Kirk, none of that makes any sense.",
        "KIRK: What?",
        "LUKE: I know a little about cars, that was all gibberish.",
        "KIRK: Oh, well, would you mind not telling people about this? I've cultivated a reputation as sort of a car aficionado and in reality, all I have is a Jan and Dean record.",
        "LUKE: I'll keep it to myself.",
        "KIRK: I should probably listen to it again.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, I would.",
        "KIRK: Man, I wish my mom would let me have a car. . .or a bike. . .or my roller skates back.",

        "[Gypsy is looking under Jackson's truck]",
        "GYPSY: You don't take care of it.",
        "JACKSON: I take great care of it.",
        "GYPSY: This truck doesn't like you.",
        "JACKSON: Oh, is it talking to you now?",
        "GYPSY: Your transmission's shot.",
        "JACKSON: I shift up and down a lot.",
        "GYPSY: Mr. Grind-it-\u0091til-you-find-it, huh?",
        "JACKSON: Just tell me what needs doing.",
        "GYPSY: Be faster to say what doesn't need doing.",
        "JACKSON: Whatever you want.",
        "GYPSY: You ride your breaks. Bad for the truck, good for me. I like replacing brakes. Pays for the cable TV.",
        "JACKSON: No problem. How \u0091bout I just make the check out directly to your cable company, would that be easier for you?",
        "GYPSY: Yeah, thanks. And get some extra checks \u0091cause you're gonna be making one out to my milkman, too. Oh, and looky here, you just bought me a couch. [Luke walks up to them] Hey Luke.",
        "LUKE: Hey Gypsy. I don't wanna interrupt.",
