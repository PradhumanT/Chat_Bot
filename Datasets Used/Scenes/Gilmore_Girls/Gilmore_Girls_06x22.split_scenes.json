        "JACKSON: Don't open the door, Davey. The door's loud.",
        "SOOKIE: Let daddy open the door! I'm worried about her.",

        "LOGAN: I don't even know why I'm doing this. Why am I doing this whole cap-and-gown thing?",

        "TAYLOR: Who's Neil Young?",
        "KIRK: One of the Monkees. Anyway I'm guessing when word hit the east coast troubadour community, every one of them thought to come to stars hollow for their shot at the big time.",
        "TAYLOR: There's an east coast troubadour community?",
        "KIRK: Oh, yes, our wandering musical storytellers. It's an honored American tradition going back to the puritans. Gierke Schoonhoven delighted his fellow pilgrims with his timely songs. His most popular was \"a beaver ate my thumb.\" It was quite catchy. I wonder if Neil still does \"Last Train to Clarksville.\" I love that song.",

        "TROUBADOUR3: I'm kind of doing a song here.",
        "TAYLOR: It won't take long. Please, people, your attention! I would just like to say that there is no bigger fan of music than the man standing before you. No memory is more precious to me than the one of my father taking me to the Hartford civic auditorium to see the great Pat Boone. But you, my friends, do not have the talent of Pat Boone. And if you insist on loitering and playing your hippie doo-wop music to the obvious detriment of the mercantile interests of this town, our authorities will forcibly remove you... with water hoses and canine units if necessary! Thank you for your time, and, uh... goodbye.",

        "LORELAI: Ah that's right, the graduation. Wow. How was it?",
        "RORY: I'm here now. It was nice. Logan looked great, very dignified. He didn't trip. He remembered to wear pants.",
        "LORELAI: He's quite a catch, that guy.",
        "RORY: I was very proud of him. I'm just waiting for him to extricate himself from those people.",

        "LORELAI: No! Why?",
        "RORY: I made reservations at this crappy Italian restaurant with Chianti bottles hanging from the ceiling, and the husband and wife that own the place wind up screaming at each other after 8:00, we love it.",
        "LORELAI: Sounds great.",
        "RORY: Well it's our last night together for a while. I want it to be really special.",

        "MISS PATTY: Oh, she had to go, honey. I told her I'd take the morning shift. She told me to tell you that everything went fine. Paul Anka ate all his food, and then he did something weird with your nightgown.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, are you cross-dressing again? I got here at 7:30. I gave him a little kibble and a new hoof, and he ran around the house a few times and then passed out in the corner. He's been quiet ever since.",
        "LORELAI: Thank you guys for doing this, Patty. Paul Anka's never spent the whole night alone before.",
        "MISS PATTY: Oh, it's our pleasure, sweetheart. So, you're staying out all night, huh? Anything illegal?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, no, no. Just a little girls' night out. Or in, I should say. Sookie and I had a slumber party.",
        "MISS PATTY: Oh, that sounds fun.",
        "LORELAI: Do you want some coffee, Patty?",
        "MISS PATTY: Oh, no, sweetheart. I need to get going. I'm teaching a cardio striptease class at 10:00. I have to make sure those poles are screwed in tight.",

        "MISS PATTY: Well, uh, I-I don't know. You know, half the time people speak to me, I'm thinking about Baryshnikov. Did you see \"turning point\"?",

        "MISS PATTY: Oh, that man was so beautiful.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, I'm sure.",
        "MISS PATTY: Pure s*x walking. Flying, actually. That man could fly. Have you ever thought of taking dance?",
        "LUKE: Me? No.",
        "MISS PATTY: Well, maybe you might want to think about it. There's nothing sexier than a man in tights.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, I'm sure that's true. Look, can you just tell Lorelai I came by?",
        "MISS PATTY: Oh, of course I will, honey.",
        "LUKE: Stop imagining me in tights, patty.",

        "LORELAI: I will.",
        "MISS PATTY: Oh, and, honey, don't freeze him out too long. Luke is a much better man than my first husband... or second husband. But he's neck and neck with the third one, though.",
        "LORELAI: Okay.",
        "MISS PATTY: Bye, Paul Anka! Thank you for letting me scratch your butt for an hour! Just like husband number four.",

        "MITCHUM: No, I was not.",
        "RORY: Yeah. 'Cause why would your son want to go out with his girlfriend the last day before he leaves, right?",
        "MITCHUM: Rory...",
        "RORY: And this gathering of yours, it turns into a business meeting on his graduation day? As if Logan's not gonna have enough time for that during the year you're forcing him to do in London.",
        "MITCHUM: It wasn't exactly a business meeting.",
        "RORY: Why are you doing this?",

        "RORY: Oh, please. You have done nothing but get involved.",
        "MITCHUM: How?",
        "RORY: You're sending him away, 5,000 miles away. What other reason is there but to separate us?",
        "MITCHUM: Well you flatter yourself if you think I put that much energy into thinking about your relationship.",
        "RORY: Here's the lobby.",
        "MITCHUM: Wait let's get this clear right now. I'm sending Logan away for one reason, because it is time, it is time for him to stop jumping out of planes in a gorilla mask and crashing boats and getting plastered every night and ending up in the hospital. It's time for him to stop being a child and to start being a man. It's time for him to start focusing on his future, and the only way he is gonna do that is to get him out of his environment and away from those dopes, Colin and Finn, and \"The Life and Death Brigade\" and get him on a path. Logan is talented he's talented. He's my son. I want him to achieve something. And he needs a push. It's what my father did with me. He pushed me, I grew up, and now Logan is gonna grow up.

I really had myself believing it was gonna happen. I bought that stupid dress, and now it's just hanging there, mocking me. And the crazy thing is, I am ready to get married. I am ready to start the next phase of my life. I want another kid, and I, I don't want to wait anymore. I don't want to be patient. I've been patient long enough. I'm not happy, and I feel crappy all the time. And I just think I've had it.",
