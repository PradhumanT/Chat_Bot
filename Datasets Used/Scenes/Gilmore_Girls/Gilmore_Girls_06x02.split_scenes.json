        "(OPEN in front of the Twickham House, night. Lorelai & Sookie are standing there, looking up at it)",
        "LORELAI: It's big",
        "SOOKIE: That's what she said.",
        "LORELAI: Good one",
        "SOOKIE: Hey, I'm still twelve.",
        "LORELAI: I meant the house. It's very big.",
        "SOOKIE: Very sweet of Luke to have that dream of his. You two living in this house!",
        "LORELAI: What do you think there are? Twelve rooms?",
        "SOOKIE: At least! I mean you can really go to town in this place. You could have a dedicated sewing room. I mean, that's a no-brainer.",
        "LORELAI: Are you kidding? I could put a whole loom in one of those rooms. Indulge my long harboured desire to make tapestries",
        "SOOKIE: You've been long harbouring that one?",
        "LORELAI: I just thought of it, but yeah!",
        "SOOKIE: So it's all feeling good, huh?",
        "LORELAI: Well it's a little on the Versailles side. I mean I have to keep an eye out for peasants with pitchforks.",
        "SOOKIE: I meant the relationship. You're engaged for Gosh sakes!",
        "LORELAI: Yes! I'm aware!",
        "SOOKIE: And sticking?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, Sookie, it's sticking!",
        "SOOKIE: Good, good!... How 'bout now?",
        "LORELAI: I'm totally re-evaluating the whole thing.",
        "SOOKIE: Really?",
        "LORELAI: (exasperated) NO!",
        "SOOKIE: Well...You've got priors!",
        "LORELAI: Sookie!",
        "SOOKIE: You say one thing, but your heart says another.",
        "LORELAI: Please! Don't give me the whole litany. Especially one that sounds so much like a Kenny Chesney song.",
        "SOOKIE: I'm just being honest.",
        "LORELAI: (determined) I'm not going to bolt. I'm staying put.",
        "SOOKIE: Good. (knowingly) Because the eyes will give you away.",
        "LORELAI: What do you mean?",
        "SOOKIE: If you're thinking of bolting they'll pop out on you, like that runway bride. It's like the eyes are trying to run away first.",
        "LORELAI: Sookie look at my eyes.",
        "(Sookie looks into Lorelai's eyes)",
        "SOOKIE: OK...",
        "LORELAI: How do they look?",
        "SOOKIE: Pretty socked in there.",
        "LORELAI: And there they will remain. Everything's good. Promise",
        "SOOKIE: Good. Pretty eyes too.",
        "LORELAI: I'm taken.",
        "SOOKIE: Sorry!",
        "LORELAI: (turns to look back at the house) WOW!",
        "SOOKIE: What?",
        "LORELAI: Is it me or...",
        "SOOKIE: (looks up at the house too) Nope! I think it just got bigger.",
        "LORELAI: That's what she said.",
        "SOOKIE: Good grief.",
        "LORELAI: What!? You can be twelve, but I can't be twelve?",
        "SOOKIE: No...You can be twelve.",
        "LORELAI: Thank you.",

        "(CUT to Community Service orientation. A supervisor is walking around the room, explaining the rules. All the \"felons\" are sitting on desks))",
        "SUPERVISOR: Remember to sign in at the get-go. If you do not sign in your work that day will not count against your community service hours, so do it! Same thing at the end. Sign out. Don't forget! Each shift is three and a half hours. Double shifts will include a half hour lunch break and it's bring your own. (picks up a stack of papers and hands them to a person sitting at one of the front desks). Take one down and pass it around. (camera pans to the \"felons\" sitting and follows as the papers get passed around the room). These are your guidelines. They outline safety procedures, behaviour requirements etc. If you cause any trouble you will come back here to see me, something I do not want to happen. Now lets talk about what you will not bring. First on the list weapons of any kind. I'll state the obvious first. You will not bring a gun. You will not bring chains. You will not bring knives of any kind, including penknives, nail files, razor blades, carpet cutters. (camera pans to Rory, she looks out of place with all the other people in the orientation) You will not bring rope, you will not bring brass knuckles or anything that can be used as a truncheon.",
        "(CUT to Luke's diner, morning. Luke & Lorelai come down from the apartment talking)",
        "LUKE: And they have those flash light thingies",
        "LORELAI: Yeah! That's the right name for those. Flash Light Thingies.",
        "LUKE: And Jedi powers of mind control, and they can move things, so they're telekinetic. And they hover on their jet saucers over molten lava, and they can jump and fly around like they're in Cirque Du Soleil...",
        "LORELAI: Ah! Coffee, please. (Luke goes behind the counter to get the coffee, Lorelai sits on a stool)",
        "LUKE:...But what gives one Jedi knight the edge over the other, huh? The ultimate advantage? They stand on a mound of dirt and declare, \"you can't win. I've got the high ground.\"",
        "LORELAI: Dude, if he said it that's the way it is. It's a fictional world.",
        "LUKE: He's four feet up a little sloap, and that wipes out all the other guys powers to fly, jump around, move things with his brain, use his flashlight thingy?",
        "LORELAI: You've got to learn the right term for that flashlight thingy!",
        "LUKE: This has been bugging me!",
        "LORELAI: For months! We saw that movie months ago. You've got to let it go.",
        "LUKE: I can't!",
        "LORELAI: George Lucas owns San Fransisco now. That's a city! You can't argue with a man who owns a city.",
        "LUKE: All the other guy has to do is scurry onto land, run up a hill a bit, and then he has the high ground. I mean, they can fly jetpods, but they can't scurry?",
        "LORELAI: Go on a website or something, OK? Cause there are thousands...no, millions of your kind out there debating all the minutiae of, not just this Star Wars movie, but every Star Wars movie!",
        "LUKE: You drag me to see these movies.",
        "LORELAI: No, you wanted to see that movie.",
        "LUKE: So I can't critique it because I wanted to see it?",
        "LORELAI: That's how it works.",
        "LUKE: What about \"Bewitched\"?",
        "LORELAI: (closes her eyes and breathes deep in restrain) Okay, I'm sorry. They screwed up \"Bewitched\". Nicole Kidman, good choice. But that concept?",
        "LUKE: You should go on a website",
        "LORELAI: No! but \"Bewitched\" is iconic!...Dr. Bombay, Larry Tate. There was no Larry Tate.",
        "LUKE: (a bit condescending) Hey! Let it go! We saw this months ago!",
        "LORELAI: This is different. You can't have \"Bewitched\" without Larry Tate.",
        "LUKE: Here's your coffee.",
        "LORELAI: (sighs and takes the to go cup) So should we stop going to movies?",
        "LUKE: We should stop caring.",
        "LORELAI: OK! Bye doll!",
        "LUKE: Bye",
        "(They kiss and Lorelai exits the diner. Camera follows as Luke walks behind the counter and as he reaches to clean a table we see TJ cleaning up some shelves. He starts to stroke them lovingly)",
        "TJ: You see these?",
        "LUKE: Yeah, I saw them before TJ. Stop doing that. It's creepy.",
        "TJ: (stands up straight by the shelves proudly) Some of my best work these shelves.",
        "LUKE: They seem very shelfy.",
        "TJ: You're not excited.",
        "LUKE: I tend not to get to excited about things like shelves.",
        "TJ: I hate that you've lost the little boy in you.",
        "LUKE: Don't cry for me",
        "(They walk away from the table. Luke goes behind the counter. TJ follows from the other side of the counter)",
        "TJ: By the way, I'm throwing in my top shelf as an engagement gift for you, brother-in-law.",
        "LUKE: Great! Thanks.",
        "TJ: Of course, my per-shelf rate's gone up since we last talked. So it all comes out to the same money.",
        "LUKE: Yeah...well, funny how that works.",
        "TJ: It's very exciting that Lorelai's gonna be my sister-in-law. Having another hot girl in the family is gonna be tres cool.",
        "LUKE: Uh-huh.",
        "TJ: People are really gonna stare when the two of us are squiring our delectable wives around.",
        "LUKE: I don't know just how much mutual squiring you and I are going to be doing.",
        "TJ: You got to admit our wives are hot. (draws in the air with his hands a woman's body) Va-va to the voom.",
        "LUKE: (disturbed) T.J... Your wife is my sister.",
        "TJ: That don't make you blind, does it? Va-va...(starts to do the air drawing thing again)",
        "LUKE: Don't go to the voom again!",
        "TJ: Mr. Sensitive.",
        "LUKE: You're done here, right? Don't you have somewhere to go?",
        "TJ: I'm pretty free. I was gonna go home and watch \"Bewitched\" on dvd, but your woman spoiled that for me.",
        "LUKE: Yeah...I got to check something out in the storeroom. (starts walking towards the storeroom. TJ follows him and stops him before he leaves)",
        "TJ: Wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait. Wait. Wait. I need your okay on something.",
        "LUKE: As long as it doesn't involve my sister.",
        "TJ: It pays to advertise, right? I want to put a sign up on the shelves to let people know who did them. \"Shelves by AJ\"",
        "LUKE: AJ? Why AJ? Why not TJ?",
        "TJ: 'Cause I'm going in the yellow pages, and I want to be up at the top. \"T\" puts me after everything except \"u,\" \"v,\" \"w,\" \"x,\" \"y,\" and \"z\" and I think a few others. Smart, huh?",
        "LUKE: Yeah, well I just don't want you advertising here, T.J.",
        "TJ: Well, is it okay if I give out my card to any inquiring party? (gets out a card from his toolbelt and gives it to Luke)",
        "LUKE: Sure, if they inquire, give them a card. (reads the card) You crossed out \"Ralph's Shoe Repair\" and wrote in \"AJ Construction.\" That's your card?",
        "TJ: I don't technically have cards. So I take them from other businesses and write my own stuff in it.",
        "LUKE: You wanna...You might want to cross out the picture of the guy shining the boot. It might confuse things.",
        "TJ: Thanks. (Luke exits to the storeroom) What a team, huh? What a team? (TJ approaches two customers sitting on the counter) How about those shelves, huh? You plus your fat cousins could sit on them. They wouldn't break. They're that strong. Here, take a card. (gives them a card)",
        "(CUT outside to Stars Hollow pet fair, same day. Lorelai is walking around looking at the animals)",
        "LORELAI: Hello, porky! Hello. O-h-h-H! Well, I'm feeling a little guilty because of the you-L.T I had yesterday. That's right, I'm sorry. Please forgive me. Hi, fellas. What's up? You both look like killers. (sees a cage with a cute furry mutt) Hey. Hey, you! Oh, someone seems very happy.",
        "FAIR SALES PERSON: He likes you, and he's picky.",
        "LORELAI: He's cute. You're cute. You're shaggy cute. Oh, we got a love thing going on, don't we? (Miss Patty approaches Lorelai)",
        "MISS PATTY: (accusingly) What are you doing?",
        "LORELAI: I'm just enjoying the animals, Patty.",
        "MISS PATTY: (to fair sales person) Honey, this is not right. She can't have a love thing with a dog.",
        "FAIR SALES PERSON: She can't?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, I can. Go about your business there, Patty.",
        "MISS PATTY: You must have her name on some blacklist back there, don't you?",
        "FAIR SALES PERSON: We don't have a blacklist.",
        "MISS PATTY: But this is Lorelai Gilmore.",
        "LORELAI: Ignore her. (to Patty) This dog loves me. And the pig...the pig loved me.",
        "MISS PATTY: It looks dead.",
        "LORELAI: It's sleeping. (to fair sales person) They sleep, right?",
        "FAIR SALES PERSON: Actually, that's very unusual for her to be sleeping. (to anohter fair member) Meg, make sure the pig's okay.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, the pig's fine.",
        "MISS PATTY: (accusingly) You didn't touch it, did you?",
        "LORELAI: I did not kill the pig, Patty.",
        "MISS PATTY: You got a bad record. You got to admit it.",
        "LORELAI: That thing with the hamster was a long time ago. It was a long time ago! And..and it was only a hamster. I mean it's not really in the same category as dog or pig, now, is it?",
        "MISS PATTY: What about the rabbit?",
        "LORELAI: Okay, the rabbit was sick when I got it. It was sick when I got it! It was actually very humanitarian of me to take it in the first place.",
        "MISS PATTY: And that poor turtle. It was supposed to outlive you.",
        "LORELAI: Kay! You're really kind of bringing down the pet fair here, Patty.",
        "MISS PATTY: Honey, go see \"March Of The Penguins.\" That's really as close to the animals as you should get. (walks away)",
        "LORELAI: (to fair sales person) She's a comedienne, that one. She just gets a bit, and then she keeps on going, you know, even with one that's not funny. It's a (far sales person walks away)...(to the dog) Hi. See you later, kiddo.",
        "LIZ: (running towards Lorelai) Lorelai!",
        "LORELAI: Liz, hi. (they hug)",
        "LIZ: You and Luke engaged!",
        "LORELAI: Yes, we are!",
        "LIZ: I want to eat your face.",
        "LORELAI: Is that good?",
        "LIZ: You're my sister-in-law. Mrs. Danes, not that you're changing your name. You don't got to. Go modern.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, I'm not sure what I'm gonna do.",
        "LIZ: (takes Lorelai's hand in hers and inspects the ring) This ring. My brother has good taste.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, he does.",
        "LIZ: You ever see my ring?(hold out her ring finger) It's a beaut, huh?",
        "LORELAI: Definitely.",
        "LIZ: Had a problem with it for a while. It turned my finger green.",
        "LORELAI: Well, that's common with metal.",
        "LIZ: No, it's worse than that. The finger turned green, then it turned blue, then purple. So, I went to this doctor, and he's talking amputation.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, my god!",
        "LIZ: But TJ picked it out for me, so I love it, I really do.",
        "LORELAI: It's the thought that counts.",
        "LIZ: Well, I got to get going. I actually have a finger-therapy session I have to go to. Sister-in-laaaws! (hold up her ring, and Lorelai reluctantly joins her)",
        "LORELAI: Sister-in-laws!",
        "LIZ: Oh, I'm a jerk.",

        "LIZ: I forgot to ask you about Rory.",
        "LORELAI: Right.",
        "LIZ: So, is she staying here with you during the summer break?",
        "LORELAI: (uncomfortable) Oh, well, actually...Luke didn't tell you about all this?",
        "LIZ: All what?",
        "LORELAI: She's staying with her grandparents for the summer.",
        "LIZ: Really?",
        "LORELAI: For a change of pace. And she'll be working and...yeah.",
        "LIZ: Ah! Your whole extended family. You, your parents, so close. It's nice.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, it is.",

        "RICHARD: Try! I've given up.",
        "EMILY: I told him to take that mp3 device off his head while he worked, and he did. Then I hid behind the curtains, and he put his mp3 device right back in his ears. (Rory walks in the dinning room and stand around awkwardly)",
        "RICHARD: We're paying him too much if he's able to afford an mp3 device.",

        "EMILY: And what was that language?",
        "RORY: Spanish.",

        "LORELAI: Come in, come in, come in! I want to show you something.",
        "LUKE: OK.",
        "LORELAI: (giggles) Or...more accurately, I want to show you someone. (they walk in the living room, which is filled with doggie stuff) Ta-da! Where'd he go?",
        "LUKE: Where'd who go? What's all this crap?",
        "LORELAI: (disappointed) Aaaww! Yoo-hoo! Come on, dude. We had it all rehearsed and everything. A! Aha! Ha ha. Yeah. Okay. (produces the dog from behind an armchair) Ta-da!",
        "LUKE: (surprised and weirded out) It's a dog.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah! Very good. (to the dog in a funny voice) He's smart, too. Not as smart as you.(carries him to the coffee table and sets him there, sits next to him and starts to pet him)",
        "LUKE: What are you doing with a dog?",
        "LORELAI: I bought him. Doesn't he look happy?",
        "LUKE: Yeah, I guess. (disbelievingly) You bought a dog!",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, and he loves me. And he doesn't give his love easily. The only drawback is the name. Cocoa. It's too cutesy. But he's a rescue, so I don't want to freak him out by giving him a new name right away, so, I'm gonna get to the name I want to givr him in baby steps. For the first week, I'll call him Cocoa to get him acclimated.",
        "LUKE: Acclimated.",
        "LORELAI: Second week, I'm gonna call him Cokey. Third week \"Kooky\". Fourth week \"Tooky\".",
        "LUKE: So, you're gonna name him Tooky?",
        "LORELAI: No. I'm gonna name him Paul Anka, but it's gonna take a while to get to Paul Anka.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, I'd say so.",
        "LORELAI: (gets up from the table) And, you know, this little guy has already taught me something I didn't know! Just because they make it for a dog doesn't mean a dog is gonna like it. Toys, including squeakies (picks up a toy and squeezes it, makes a sound) and the \"whazzup\" variety (picks up another toy that looks like a monkey, squeezes it and it says \"whazzup?\"): No interest. Rawhide bones: no interest. Popcorn: scared of it.",
        "LUKE: Scared of popcorn?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, and also of tissue holders, paperbacks, cds, framed pictures, and lint. Oh! And when I drink something, he gets freaked out like I'm gonna die, and I have to pick him up and rock him like a baby until he calms down. It's been quite a first day for us.",
        "LUKE: Look, should I ask the question",
        "that immediately came to mind when I first saw the thing, or should I just shut up?",
        "LORELAI: No. Shoot.",
        "LUKE: Is it okay for you to...",
        "LORELAI: (cuts Luke off)...That hamster was defective. Period. Plus, they only live like three years, I looked it up. And...and...and he would have been dead by now anyway. So, world, stop with the hamster already.",
        "LUKE: But the turtle...",
        "LORELAI: (cuts him off again) The same thing with the turtle.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, but they live to be 90.",
        "LORELAI: I will take care of this dog. I promise. Now, would you like a beer?",
        "LUKE: Sure.",
        "LORELAI: OK. Just distract him while I'm drinking. And don't let him see the (whispers) bottle opener. (they walk to the kitchen. PA is left in the living room)",
        "(CUT to Lorelai's kitchen, continuous. Luke and Lorelai enter. Lorelai goes to the fridge)",
        "LUKE: How much did you spend on all this?",
        "LORELAI: Tons. (gets two beers out of the fridge and gives one to Luke)",
        "LUKE: For a stupid dog.",
        "LORELAI: You're acting like you don't like dogs.",
        "LUKE: I don't like dogs.",
        "LORELAI: (PA enters the kitchen) Shh! He heard you.",
        "LUKE: He speaks English?",
        "LORELAI: Since when do you not like dogs?",
        "LUKE: Since all the times I made that really, really clear, which is every time I've ever been around a dog.",
        "LORELAI: What is there not to like about dogs?",
        "LUKE: (sits at the table. Lorelai puts some food for PA) They're dirty, they're a pain to train, they're a pain to wash, they bark when they shouldn't, they jump on you when you don't want them to, they chew things, they shed, they lick themselves, they make your house smell, they make your car smell, and they make you smell.",
        "LORELAI: (sighs and joins him at the table) You know I think it's very sad that you've lost the little boy in you.",
        "LUKE: The little boy didn't like dogs, either.",
        "LORELAI: Oh! You know. I just realized what this is. This is our thing.",
        "LUKE: What thing?",
        "LORELAI: This tradition of ours. You claim to hate everything at first, but it's just your initial stance in a negotiation. And then we talk, and our opinions merge, and we find a happy middle.",
        "LUKE: No. A lot of times, it's just how I feel, and my mind doesn't change.(PA goes over to his food bowl)",
        "LORELAI: OK, oh! he's eating. Come on, let's go! (she gets up and gestures Luke to follow) But don't make any sudden movements, and don't drink and don't look at him. He's very self-conscious about his eating. I'm the same way. That's how I know this is gonna work! Go! Go, go, go! (they exit the kitchen and stare at PA while he's eating through the kitchen door window)",
        "LUKE: You do realize your dog has just driven us out of the house?",
        "LORELAI: Don't worry. He's a quick eater. Come on. (they start walking)",
        "(CUT to Lorelai's porch, continuous. Lorelai and Luke are walking on the porch)",
        "LORELAI: Shh.",
        "LUKE: This is silly.",
        "LORELAI: What? We can hang out here.",
        "It's a nice night. (they sit on the couch on the porch) Okay. Now, fill me in. How was your day?",
        "LUKE: Well, I talked to some contractors about the Twickham House.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, yeah?",
        "LUKE: As soon as we make the offer, they'll let us in. We can start planning stuff. Remodelling, whatever.",
        "LORELAI: Good.",
        "LUKE: And as soon as we're out of escrow, we can start work.",
        "LORELAI: Cool. Excellent.",
        "LUKE: I was thinking we could even pull the crew over here. Do some quick touch-ups before selling.",
        "LORELAI: Wait. Touch-ups? Where? Here?",
        "LUKE: Yeah. It hasn't been painted in a while. Fixing it up will help it sell.",
        "LORELAI: Right. You know, I've been thinking?",
        "LUKE: What?",
        "LORELAI: Maybe...we should...hang on to this house.",
        "LUKE: To rent?",
        "LORELAI: No! Not to rent. To use...in some other way.",
        "LUKE: What other way?",
        "LORELAI: Uh...I don't know. we...It could be, like, a paint studio.",
        "LUKE: We don't paint.",
        "LORELAI: Well, maybe we'll start. Maybe it's the lack of a studio that's kept us from realizing our love of watercolours.",
        "LUKE: I don't have a love of watercolours.",
        "LORELAI: Or I could use it as my recording studio. That would be cool, huh? And when I'm not laying down tracks, I could rent it out to Korn or Iggy Pop or someone. Right? You and me just hanging with Iggy Pop, rocking out, telling stories. Ig's got stories!",
        "LUKE: (understanding drawing on him) Uh-huh.",
        "LORELAI: Or we could use it as a safe house, in case we decide to take up a life of crime. (through the window PA walks up on the staircase and lies down)",
        "LUKE: I doubt we're going to do that.",
        "LORELAI: Well, we could be wrongly accused of a crime we did not commit. And then we'd have to hide out until society realized the mistake, and then we'd be like, \"Hey, no hard feelings. It happens. This is a great country, and thank god we had the safe house.\"",
        "LUKE: If you want, we can just hang on to it and rent it out.",
        "LORELAI: I don't want anyone else living in it.",
        "LUKE: They can't live in it, but they can record songs in it?",
        "LORELAI: I just think we could use this place. Think about it, OK?",
        "LUKE: Yeah, sure. We'll think about it.",
        "LORELAI: OK. (looks around into the living room and gasps) Oh, look, he's done. And he's in there fast asleep.",
        "LUKE: Great! Let's go back in.",
        "LORELAI: OK. Just be careful because he gets scared when you wake him up.",
        "LUKE: Of course.",
        "LORELAI: OK. (they start walking back to the house) Oh, and try not to say any words that begin with the letter \"Q\".",

        "LIZ: Whaaa...I'm just excited about all this. A new adventure!",

        "LIZ: I want to talk to you about something, Luke.",

        "LUKE: Yes.",
        "LIZ: And you know who I'm married to.",
        "LUKE: Yes.",
        "LIZ: He'd be perfect for this!",

        "LIZ: Oh, but he is.",
        "LUKE: Since when?",
        "LIZ: Since he almost passed the test for his contractor's license last month. I mean, he was so close. If he hadn't used all those curse words during the written exam, he'd have had it.",
        "LUKE: He used curse words?",
        "LIZ: When he's enthusiastic about something, he gets very foul. But I blame his mother. She has got a mouth on her. Garbage mouth!",
        "LUKE: I don't think he can do the job, Liz. (he walks to a table to clean it up. Liz follows him around)",
        "LIZ: Oh, but, my brother, he's working so hard for his license. You should see him! It is so cute. He sits up in bed at night poring through his books and his manuals. He's got this system where he reads a chapter then rewards himself with a junior mint. It's been working great for him.",
        "LUKE: There is no way in the world that he is getting this job, Liz.",
        "LIZ: But what about the shelves he made you? I thought you liked them.",
        "LUKE: They're just shelves.",
        "LIZ: Oh, what happened to the little boy in you?",
        "LUKE: Look, the shelves are nice, but this is a big job. Lorelai loves this house. This is a great house. (he walks back behind the counter, Liz follows him yet again)",
        "LIZ: Luke, his life depends on it.",
        "LIZ: How?",
        "LUKE: Because if he doesn't get his ass out of the house and work more...I'm gonna kill him.",
        "LUKE: There's a housing boom out there. There's plenty of work for a good carpenter like TJ.",
        "LIZ: But every time he interviews for jobs, he starts cursing. He can't help it. People mistake it for him being weird or something.",

        "LORELAI: TJ's a contractor?",
        "LUKE: No, and I said \"No\"! But she made me promise to think about it. And then she sat in the diner staring at me, and then she started to cry, so I kicked her out. And then she went outside and cried and so I could see it through the window. And I couldn't take it anymore, so I said, \"OK\", knowing we had weeks to figure out how to get out of it. And no work could be done 'cause George hadn't made up the plans. And, in the meantime, TJ could've changed occupations or injured himself bouncing up and down on his trampoline and backed out of the job.",
        "LORELAI: But how could you risk saying \"oK\" to anything with TJ?",
        "LUKE: Did I mention the crying? Liz is a walking tear duct. Oh, TJ's good! You never see what's coming. Like a big, dumb tsunami. He's that good!",
        "LORELAI: So, what do we do?",
        "LUKE: I'm gonna talk to TJ, but I'm gonna be smart about it, I'm not gonna spook him. I'm gonna be like Michael Corleone dealing with that slimy brother-in-law of his. Get a couple of tickets to a ball game, invite him along. And we'll talk about the beer and the hot dogs we're gonna eat. And then I'm gonna get him to admit that he did this. And then when we get in the car on the way to the ball park, I'm gonna put a rope around his neck and pull it till he's (pulls an imaginary rope) Dead!",

        "LUKE: No, he's not that bright. It'll work!",

        "LUKE: Well you said it, and I agreed, so I win.",

They're on their honeymoon in Florida. And they got these smiles on their faces like their lives are gonna work out the way they dreamt or something...suckers! Those things.",
        "LORELAI: You played right into her hands. You can't do that. She can't just play on our emotions. She has to undo what she's done. Get out of my parents' house. Go back to school.",
        "LUKE: Fine! Maybe I shouldn't have told her anything. Maybe I should've kicked her out, ignored her, whatever! But you got to understand something: I'm in the middle! Yeah, she's your daughter, but I'm in the middle!",
        "LORELAI: (apologetic) I know. You are in the middle.",
