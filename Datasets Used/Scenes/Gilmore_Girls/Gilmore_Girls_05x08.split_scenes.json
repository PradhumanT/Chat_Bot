        "LORELAI: I smell meat, is that meat?",
        "VALET: Why, yes, miss, it is meat.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, he called me miss. There's meat and a miss, I'm happy.",
        "RORY: What's the occasion?",
        "RICHARD: Well, I thought we might like some appetizers with our cocktails tonight.",
        "LORELAI: Would we ever.",
        "VALET: The first batch is ready, sir.",
        "RICHARD: Wonderful, on the table please.",
        "LORELAI: Mm, God it smells good.",
        "RORY: I love a good steak on a stick.",
        "RICHARD: Me, too.",
        "RORY: We should form a club.",
        "LORELAI: Steak-On-A-Stick club.",
        "RICHARD: We could have t-shirts made up.",
        "RORY: Grandpa, I've never seen you wear a t-shirt.",
        "RICHARD: Well, I've just never found a proper occasion.",
        "LORELAI: Hmm. To the proper occasion. [They toast.]",
        "RICHARD: I'll drink to that.",
        "EMILY [storming in]: I knew I smelled something, you're barbecuing!",
        "RICHARD: So what?",
        "EMILY: So what? The agreement was the girls have drinks with you and dinners with me!",
        "RICHARD: We are having drinks. Drinks and appetizers.",
        "EMILY: Those are not appetizers! Those are skewers!",
        "LORELAI: Little skewers.",
        "RORY: Little tiny skewers.",
        "EMILY: This is not tiny! [She rips a skewer from Lorelai's hand as she's about to bite.]",
        "LORELAI: Mom, that's mine!",
        "EMILY: This is a main course and a cheap way of cheating me out of my dinner.",
        "RICHARD: You are the most paranoid woman I've ever met.",
        "EMILY: I highly doubt that.",
        "RICHARD: You were the one who designated the drinks portion of the evening to me.",
        "EMILY: You love drinks.",
        "RICHARD: Drinks last one hour at most. Then you get the dinner portion, which can last several hours. Especially the way you structure things. You get more time. I should at least be able to serve appetizers with my drinks.",
        "EMILY: Fine. I'll leave. Have you drinks and your appetizers. [Points at",
        "RORY and Lorelai.] You two better be hungry when you get inside, or else! [Leaves.]",
        "LORELAI [whispers, mimicking]: Or else!",
        "RORY: Sounds serious.",
        "LORELAI: So, one more?",
        "RORY: Well, two more at the most.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, 'cause she was really mad.",
        "RORY: Mm-hmm.",
        "[Elder Gilmore house: dining room]",
        "[Awkward silence.]",
        "EMILY: Something wrong?",
        "LORELAI: No, why, why?",
        "EMILY: You're not eating.",
        "LORELAI: No, I am eating.",
        "EMILY: You've taken two bites.",
        "LORELAI: Two really big bites.",
        "EMILY: Rory's taken none.",
        "RORY: I did, you just missed it.",
        "EMILY: You're full.",
        "LORELAI: No!",
        "EMILY: He can't stick to a simple agreement! He makes deals all the time in business, but \"drinks there, dinner here\", somehow that's too difficult for him to manage.",
        "RORY: He was just -",
        "EMILY: He was trying to upstage me. He was trying to make his part of the evening the \"fun\" part. He's a child. A spoiled four-year-old. I should take his dump truck away and send him to bed without supper. Or, as he calls it, appetizers.",
        "LORELAI: Mom, seriously, we are starving. Look. Mmm, wow. [To Rory] Eat some carrots, eat some carrots.",
        "RORY [weakly]: Carrots. Delicious.",
        "EMILY: Well, if you're both that hungry, you must want more. Olga! Good timing! The girls are famished. Load 'em up.",
        "[Olga serves up more food. A cell phone rings.]",
        "EMILY [scolding]: Lorelai!",
        "LORELAI: What? It's not me!",
        "RORY: It's me, Grandma. I'm sorry. [Checks caller ID] I have to take this. Promise I'll be quick. [She gets up to leave.] Hello? Hi. No, now's fine.",
        "EMILY: Who's she talking to?",
        "LORELAI: How should I know?",
        "EMILY: Well, you're the one who taught her to leave her cell phone on at the dinner table.",
        "LORELAI: That's for safety, Mom. In case someone forces her to eat five chickens and she has to call 911.",
        "EMILY: She's talking to a boy, isn't she?",
        "LORELAI: I don't know.",
        "EMILY: She certainly sounds like she's talking to a boy. Does she have a new boyfriend?",
        "LORELAI: Mom!",
        "EMILY: Did she finally meet someone at Yale?",
        "RORY: I don't know.",
        "EMILY: Oh, of course you know!",
        "LORELAI: Because I'm the one who taught her to leave her cell phone on at the dinner table?",
        "RORY [coming back in]: Sorry, Grandma. That won't happen again.",
        "EMILY: That's all right. So, who were you talking to?",
        "RORY: Dean, you remember Dean?",
        "EMILY: The boy who made you the car?",
        "RORY: Yep.",
        "EMILY: I didn't know you were still seeing him.",
        "RORY: Umm, well, we got back together recently.",
        "EMILY: Really? Well, that's a surprise, isn't it, Lorelai?",
        "LORELAI: I know. I'm floored!",
        "RORY: He's been working crazy shifts lately and I've had so much schoolwork that we keep missing each other, so I told him to call me tonight.",
        "EMILY: Well thank you for telling me. I'm just glad I got to hear it from you and didn't have to pick it up on the street somewhere.",
        "LORELAI: 'Cause you hang out on the street so often, Mom, you and Melrose Larry Green.",
        "EMILY [Glares at Lorelai, then turns to Rory]: So, are you happy with this",
        "DEAN?",
        "RORY: Yes, I am.",
        "EMILY: Well, good. Now eat up, we have the fish course coming.",
        "LORELAI: Fish course?",
        "EMILY: Yes, Olga makes a mean pickled herring.",
        "LORELAI: Oh. Well. What a delightful skill.",
        "[Elder Gilmore house: exterior]",
        "[Rory and Lorelai walk sluggishly out of the house.]",
        "RORY: Grandma's mean.",
        "LORELAI: If it flew, swam or crawled on this earth we just ate it.",
        "RORY: I can't breathe. [Lorelai pinches her.] Ow! What was that for?",
        "LORELAI: 'Cause you told my mother about Dean.",
        "RORY [rubbing her arm]: What do you mean?",
        "LORELAI: Well, I was totally covering for you with the phone call, and then you waltz back in and just tell her?",
        "RORY: My arm is swelling up!",
        "LORELAI: You were totally off the hook. I was very skillfully covering for you. Well, not skillfully, but there was a certain aplomb to my evasiveness.",
        "RORY: I'm not going to lie to Grandma about Dean. Why should I?",
        "LORELAI: Because she's her.",
        "RORY: Mom, I am with Dean. She's already met him, Grandpa's already met him, what is the problem besides this permanent welt on my arm?",
        "LORELAI: All right, fine. [sighs] You know, I'm actually hungry.",
        "[Pool house. A knock on the door. Richard goes to answer it.]",
        "EMILY: We need to talk. [She walks in, uninvited.]",
        "[Opening credits.]",
        "[Luke's Diner. Lane is refilling the coffee pot.]",
        "LANE [to Luke]: The man at table three wants to send an orange juice to the woman at table four.",
        "LUKE: As long as he's paying.",
        "LUKE [To Liz, reading a paper at the counter]: If someone who wants to eat comes in here...",
        "LIZ: I'm outie, I got it.",
        "LORELAI [Coming in]: Hey, Lane.",
        "LANE: Hi! Oh, potential hookup at table four!",
        "LORELAI: Oh, wow, diner love. \"Over easy\" takes on a whole new meaning. [Sits at the counter next to Liz.] Hey, Liz!",
        "LIZ: Hey!",
        "[They hug, genuinely happy to see each other.]",
        "LORELAI: I didn't know you were back!",
        "LIZ: Yeah, just cruised in.",
        "LORELAI: Well how are you? How's TJ?",
        "LIZ: He's great. He's gotten taller.",
        "LORELAI: I'm so glad to hear it.",
        "LIZ: So you and my brother, uh?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, well...",
        "LIZ: I'm so jazzed. I want private details.",
        "LUKE: Tell her nothing.",
        "LORELAI: Really, nothing? Not even about your Canadian mountie hat?",
        "LUKE: Liz, you have been sitting there for over an hour.",
        "LIZ: I know. I'm almost done.",
        "LORELAI: Whatcha doing?",
        "LIZ: TJ and I are thinking about buying a winter place, you know, something nice for when the Renaissance Fair season's over.",
        "LORELAI: You're moving to Stars Hollow?",
        "LUKE: No.",
        "LIZ: Thinking about it. There's some great places for sale around here.",
        "LUKE: They're not for sale, they've all been sold.",
        "LIZ [ignoring him]: Plus there's a few stores around here that are willing to sell my jewelry on consignment. And I'd like a house, you know, with a fence and a lawn...",
        "LUKE: No lawns in Stars Hollow, we had them taken out.",
        "LIZ: Hey, how much did you pay for your house?",
        "LUKE: Oh, don't ask her that. You can't ask people questions like that.",
        "LIZ: Why not?",
        "LUKE: 'Cause you can't! [To Lorelai] Don't tell her how much you paid for your house. [To Liz] You don't want to live here.",
        "LIZ: Yes I do.",
        "LUKE: It's too quiet for you.",
        "LIZ: I like quiet.",
        "LUKE: You do not like quiet. TJ does not like quiet. He likes monster trucks, and baboons that get really mad at the zoo.",
        "LIZ: That's true, he does like that.",
        "LORELAI: Luke, stop. You're going to like living so close to your family.",
        "LUKE: Yes, I've seen how much you enjoy living so close to yours. What can I get you?",
        "LORELAI [Looks at the menu]: Hmm. Nothing looks good.",
        "LUKE: I'll make you a burger.",
        "LORELAI: I don't want a burger.",
        "LIZ: Make her your gumbo. Oh, he makes the most amazing gumbo.",
        "LORELAI: You make gumbo?",
        "LIZ: And great Mexican food.",
        "LORELAI: Really?",
        "LIZ: Makes his own tortillas.",
        "LUKE: Gotta make your own tortillas. The ones in the package are crap.",
        "LIZ: And garlic soup, and paella... He was really into lasagna for a while, got obsessed. Made hundreds of lasagnas trying to find the perfect recipe. He wore an apron -",
        "LUKE: Okay! Liz, you don't even live here yet.",
        "LIZ: Fine. I gotta bail anyhow. TJ's meeting me at the realtor's office.",
        "LORELAI, it was great seeing you again.",
        "LORELAI: You too!",
        "LIZ: Later, bro.",
        "LUKE: Uh-huh.",
        "[Liz leaves.]",
        "LORELAI: You've been holding out on me.",
        "LUKE: What?",
        "LORELAI: Um, paella, gumbo, lasagna king?",
        "LUKE: You know, I have many talents, okay?",
        "LORELAI: I know. I mean, the way you keep that mountie hat perfectly balanced the entire time we're -",
        "LUKE: Okay, so, if you keep making mountie hat jokes, you're going to eventually believe that there's an actual mountie hat.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I'm very impressed. Or at least I would be, if I had any proof of these extraordinary cooking skills of yours.",
        "LUKE: Okay. I'm going to cook you the most amazing meal of your life.",
        "LORELAI: This weekend?",
        "LUKE: Stop making the mountie jokes and you're on.",
        "LORELAI: Deal. Blueberry muffin to go?",
        "LUKE: You got it. [He gets the muffin. She's looking at him strangely.] You're still picturing me in a mountie hat, aren't you?",
        "LORELAI: Uh-huh.",
        "LUKE: How do I look?",
        "LORELAI: Mm, I'll tell you this weekend.",
        "[She leaves, Kyon enters. Lane rushes over.]",
        "LANE: You cannot put those flyers here! I'm surprised that my mother told you that you could, but you can't! So, go stand on a street corner like I had to do, ages six through fourteen! [Kyon just stands there.] Go! What?",
        "KYON: I'm so hungry.",
        "LANE: What?",
        "KYON: It's flaxseed muffin month. Flaxseed muffin in the morning, flaxseed muffin at night. I'm having trouble lifting my toothbrush.",
        "LANE: Okay, come here.",
        "KYON: Not fast, please.",
        "LANE: Sit.",
        "KYON: She made a lot of food with flaxseed. It lasts a very long time.",
        "LANE [Sets down a plate of fries]: There.",
        "KYON: What's this?",
        "LANE: Fries.",
        "KYON: But Mrs. Kim, she says that fries are the devil's starchy fingers.",
        "LANE: They're hot and delicious and they don't have any flaxseed in them.",
        "KYON: But they are a gateway food. They lead into harder things. Pizza, movie popcorn, deep fried Snickers bar...",
        "[Lane waves the fries under her nose.]",
        "KYON: Oooh. [takes a bite.] Oh, my.",
        "LANE: Welcome to America.",
        "[Yale: cafeteria.]",
        "RORY: So now I've got three days to do this comparative religion paper, and the teaching fellow who runs our group spends all his time explaining to us how much he disagrees with the professor, and - what are you looking at?",
        "PARIS: That guy over there is staring at me.",
        "RORY: Which guy?",
        "PARIS: The one in the Santa Claus red sweater.",
        "RORY: Professor Prady?",
        "PARIS: Shh! He'll hear you.",
        "RORY: You think Professor Prady is looking at you?",
        "PARIS: He is more than looking at me. God, this is so annoying. Ever since word leaked out about me and Asher, every faculty member over fifty thinks I'm easy.",
        "RORY: Paris, I don't think Prady's hitting on you.",
        "PARIS: You are so naive. He's practically licking his lips. You sleep with one old guy, and suddenly you're Catherine Zeta-Jones.",
        "[Rory's phone rings.]",
        "RORY: Hello?",
        "EMILY: Rory, it's your grandmother.",
        "RORY: Oh, hey, Grandma.",
        "EMILY: Your grandfather is here also.",
        "RICHARD: Hello, Rory. How are you?",
        "RORY: Fine, Grandpa, and you?",
        "RICHARD: We're wonderful, thank you for asking.",
        "EMILY: Rory, we're sorry to bother you at school, but next Friday your grandfather and I agreed to host a little Yale alumni event at our house.",
        "RICHARD: It completely slipped our minds the other night.",
        "EMILY: So we'll have to cancel our usual Friday night dinner.",
        "RORY: Oh. That's okay.",
        "EMILY: However, we were wondering if maybe you'd like to come.",
        "RORY: Me?",
        "RICHARD: The alumni always like to meet the next generation of Elis, and plus, we'd love to be able to show you off to all of our friends, wouldn't we, Emily?",
        "EMILY: Yes, we would!",
        "RICHARD: You might even make a few connections that could come in handy somewhere down the road.",
        "EMILY: Please come! We'd hate to miss our weekly Rory fix. And I promise you, there won't be any chicken.",
        "RICHARD: Or steak on a stick. [They laugh, the whole conversation sounds very rehearsed.]",
        "RORY: Well, sure. I'd love to come.",
        "RICHARD: Wonderful. Your grandmother and I are thrilled.",
        "RORY: Is it fancy? What should I wear?",
        "EMILY: Oh, just pick out a pretty little dress.",
        "RICHARD: And bring that face.",
        "RORY: Well, the face comes with the package.",
        "EMILY: Oh, and I know you usually come at seven, but could you make it at six instead?",
        "RORY: Six is fine.",
        "RICHARD: We'll see you Friday.",
        "RORY: See you Friday. [She hangs up.]",
        "PARIS: What's going on Friday?",
        "RORY: My grandparents are having a party.",
        "PARIS: Damn it. [She gets up.] Dean Treadwell just came in. He's been throwing s*x daggers out his eyes at me all week. [She picks up her plate and leaves. Rory turns around and sees a feeble-looking old man with a cane entering.]",
        "[Luke's diner.]",
        "LANE: Chili fries, extra cheese and onions.",
        "KYON: Thank you. [Folds her hands.]",
        "LANE: Didn't you just say grace?",
        "KYON: Yes, but that was for the soda.",
        "LANE: Kyon, tip, if you pray over every single thing you eat you might never be able to leave the table. Breakfast will run into lunch which will run into dinner.",
        "KYON: I'm telling God I'm thankful!",
        "LANE: He gets it. Do a blanket thank you and move on.",
        "[Zach bursts in.]",
        "ZACH: We've got free passes to Tory's band on Saturday.",
        "LANE [excited]: No! Seriously?",
        "ZACH: Totally seriously. All we have to do is carry the equipment and we are in.",
        "[Lane shrieks and jumps on him.]",
        "ZACH: Okay, cool, you're jazzed. So I'll tell him it's a go?",
        "LANE: It's a total go.",
        "ZACH: You free for dinner tonight?",
        "LANE: We'll discuss it when I get home.",
        "ZACH: Okay. Bye.",
        "LANE: Bye.",
        "[Zach leaves, while Liz and TJ enter.]",
        "TJ: Ladies and gentlemen, I am in escrow.",
        "LUKE: You're what?",
        "TJ: I am in escrow, I've got the paperwork to prove it.",
        "LUKE: What is he talking about?",
        "LIZ: We bought a house!",
        "TJ: Beautiful. White.",
        "LUKE: You just started looking.",
        "LIZ: I know, we bought the first home we saw.",
        "LUKE: Oh, Liz.",
        "LIZ: No, I'm telling you, I walked into this place, and just felt it.",
        "LUKE: Felt what?",
        "LIZ: The vibe.",
        "TJ: That's right, she felt the vibe and now I'm in escrow.",
        "LUKE: Did you at least have an inspector look at this place?",
        "TJ: Hey, we don't need some guy with a clipboard to tell us what we already knew, which was this white house was for us!",
        "LIZ: Please don't be worried about this, the place is great.",
        "TJ: It's on a corner, it's got room for a pool, it's air-conditioner ready, it's, uh, landscaper ready, it's lawn ready, and it's got three bedrooms, if you build on two.",
        "LUKE: It's got a roof, right?",
        "TJ: Of course it's got a roof. And as soon as we replace it it won't leak as much.",
        "LIZ: Just be happy, okay?",
        "LUKE: Oh, sure.",
        "TJ: That's right, buddy, smile, man, 'cause I'm in escrow! [yells out] Coffee! On the house! You like that, on the house?",
        "LUKE: You're paying for coffee for the entire diner?",
        "TJ: What am I, made of money? I'm in escrow! Throw in the coffee, buddy, we're celebrating.",
        "LANE: I got it.",
        "LIZ: You're not really bugged we're moving here, are you?",
        "LUKE: Does he even know what escrow means?",
        "LIZ: I doubt it, but he's so happy.",
        "TJ [High-five-ing strangers]: I'm in escrow. [To Kyon] Give it up, sister, I'm in escrow.",
        "[Yale: Rory is walking the halls talking on her cell phone.]",
        "RORY: So, you're off the hook.",
        "LORELAI: Off the hook, for what?",
        "RORY: Friday night. Grandma and Grandpa are having a party for their Yale alumni friends.",
        "LORELAI: Really? This is news!",
        "RORY: So you're free as a bird.",
        "LORELAI: Wo-ow, Friday night without my mother! I don't know if I can deal! You might have to come over and force-feed me pickled herring and tell me what a disappointment I am. Hey, you want to go to the movies?",
        "RORY: Can't, I'm going to the party.",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "RORY: They asked me to.",
        "LORELAI: Huh. Okay. I can get you out of it.",
        "RORY: Mom -",
        "LORELAI: Whoop, hold on, just a moment. Let me formulate a plan.",
        "RORY: I don't need to formulate a plan, I want to go.",
        "LORELAI: You don't want to go, you feel obligated to go. That's very different.",
        "RORY: Mom, they're giving the party together.",
