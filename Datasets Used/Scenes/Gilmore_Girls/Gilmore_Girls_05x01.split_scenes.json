        "DEAN: My arm is fine.",
        "RORY: I could move.",
        "DEAN: Don't you dare move.",
        "RORY: This right here, is -- the textbook definition of a perfect moment.",
        "DEAN: Yeah, it is.",
        "RORY: And earlier? [pause]",
        "DEAN: That was pretty perfect too. However, as a guy, I was trying not to be a pig. [kisses her shoulder gently]",
        "RORY: And I'm happy, are you happy?",
        "DEAN: I'm very happy.",
        "RORY: [smiling] Happy, but not chatty?",
        "DEAN: I'm just... trying to make sure that all this is really happening.",
        "RORY: It is. [they kiss] Hey, you know what I think we need?",
        "DEAN: What?",
        "RORY: A song. Like a song that's \"our song\".",
        "DEAN: Okay.",
        "RORY: Something romantic, but not mushy, something that will make us remember this.",
        "DEAN: [chuckle] Ah, believe me, I'm remembering this.",
        "RORY: Oh, I know. [She reaches over to the nightstand and loads a nearby CD into her player and turns it on.] Okay. Perfect. So, from now on, no matter what you're doing, where you are, you'll stop and think of me when you hear this [clicks remote on. Sammy Davis Jr.'s \"The Candy Man\" plays.]",
        "DEAN: [laughs] That's not gonna be our song.",
        "RORY: Why not? It's perfect. It's happy. It's hopeful. It has the word 'candy' in it. Hey, what is more hot than candy?",
        "DEAN: Pick something else.",
        "RORY: [She bobs to the music beat and repeats the lyric in a high squeaky voice] \"Who can take the sunrise... sprinkle it with dew\"",

        "RORY: No.",

        "RORY: Bye, Dean.",
        "[Dean walks out the kitchen door and closes it. He listens to the conversation coming from inside]",
        "LORELAI: [OS] So, what did he borrow?",
        "RORY: [OS] I'm sorry I didn't talk to you about it first. I - I know I promised I would, but I swear, I didn't know that this was going to happen. I mean, I didn't know he was going to show up tonight, and it just happened. It's awful for you to find out like this, I know, but everything's okay. I'm okay, and we were, you know, safe - so all those Trojan Man jokes all these years really apparently stuck. And I'm lucky, too, because Dean, he's -- well, aren't you glad that it happened with someone who's good and really loves me?",
        "LORELAI: [OS] He's married.",
        "RORY: [OS] You don't understand the situation.",

        "LORELAI: [OS] Then I understand the situation.",
        "[Outside, Dean cringes and walks around to the front of the house to leave. The conversation still audible, he sees Rory through the lacey drapes and pauses.]",
        "LORELAI: [OS] I just want what's best for you, that's all!",
        "RORY: [OS] You're just mad because I didn't come running to you to discuss whether or not I was ready for this step. I decided it on my own.",
        "LORELAI: [OS voice fades as Dean exits] Obviously, you weren't ready for this step.",

        "LORELAI: Hey. [Rory flinches from her touch] Let's just talk.",
        "RORY: No. [She stands and stumbles back into the house. Lorelai looks grim.]",

        "[Door opens and Emily rushes in with determined purpose. Richard enters at a slower pace and follows her to small cluttered desk in a corner.]",
        "RICHARD: You do realize you just leapt out of a moving vehicle.",
        "EMILY: Everything cannot be on your schedule, Richard. [shuffles through small drawers on the desktop] Now, where is it? I know I put it in here. [She picks up a small, thin blue booklet.] Aha!",
        "RICHARD: In all the years we've been together, I have never seen you behave as irrationally as -- Emily, I'm talking to you! Will you stop? [Emily storms down the hallway, brushing aside a nearby potted palm tree frond] Emily, this feud of ours has now reached comical heights that... Charlie Chaplin, himself, would find hilarious, and he's dead.",
        "EMILY: Don't follow me, Richard.",
        "RICHARD: Oh, wait, come back. Let me get you a cane and a derby.",
        "[CUT TO BASEMENT]",
        "[Emily descends the stairs to a room crowded full of boxes, trunks, unused furniture, dusty oil paintings, a discarded pool table, old silver trays and brass pieces. Richard follows her.]",
        "RICHARD: What are you doing?",
        "EMILY: I'm looking for my European luggage, which some imbecile has chosen to hide from me.",
        "RICHARD: What do you need your European luggage for?",
        "EMILY: To put things in.",
        "RICHARD: You're making a mess.",
        "EMILY: I don't care if I'm making a mess.",
        "RICHARD: Well, who's going to clean all this up, you?",
        "EMILY: Yes, me, or the maid, or perhaps Pennilyn Lott could come by after one of your clandestine luncheons and take a stab at it.",
        "RICHARD: Oh, for heaven's sakes. Not that again. She's just a friend!",
        "EMILY: [provoking grin] I am going to Europe, Richard. I am going to Europe, and I'm going to have a marvelous time. I'm going to get up at 10:00, and I'm going to have two glasses of wine at lunch every single day.",
        "RICHARD: Only prostitutes have two glasses of wine at lunch.",
        "EMILY: Well, then buy me a boa and drive me to Reno because I am open for business.",
        "RICHARD: I -- I can't talk to you when you're like this. I'm going to bed. [exits to stairs]",
        "EMILY: You go to bed. I'll go to France.",
        "[Richard climbs the stairs to the main floor. Door slams ]",
        "[ After a pause, light piano music begins playing faintly from upstairs. Emily struggles with a large steamer trunk, dragging it up the stairs. As she reaches the door, she grasps the door knob and discovers the door won't budge.]",
        "EMILY: Richard! Richard! [pounds on the door] The door is stuck! Richard! This isn't funny!",
        "[She descends the stairs and looks around anxiously. Spying a high set window, she approaches and opens it and calls out.]",

        "RICHARD: [OS] I did not lock you in.",
        "EMILY: You certainly did lock me in.",
        "RICHARD: [OS] The door must be jammed. Did you try jiggling the knob?",
        "EMILY: I suppose I could do that, or you could just get the hell down here and let me out!",
        "RICHARD: [OS] Give me a moment, please.",
        "EMILY: If you don't come down here right now, I will climb out the window.",
        "RICHARD: [OS] You will not climb out the window.",
        "EMILY: I will. I will climb out the window right now.",
        "RICHARD: [OS] Don't you dare.",
        "EMILY: I'm doing it. I'm climbing out the window. [she begins crawling out the window]",
        "RICHARD: [OS] You better not climb out the window.",

        "RICHARD: [OS] Emily Gilmore, I better not catch you climbing out the window. [sounds of footsteps]",
        "EMILY: [panics and unzips her skirt to break free] I'm out the window. I'm out the window.",
        "RICHARD: [descends the stairs] Get down from there.",
        "EMILY: No! [slips out the window in only her sweater and hose]",

        "RICHARD: Are you having an aneurysm or something? Get inside and put this on.",
        "EMILY: Get away from me!",
        "RICHARD: Do you seriously think after 39 years of marriage, I would resort to locking you in a basement? [follows her to front of house]",
        "EMILY: I don't know what you'd resort to. I don't know who you are at all.",
        "RICHARD: I knew the mental illness in your family would catch up with you eventually.",
        "EMILY: Aunt Cora was not mentally ill! She was athletic!",
        "[flashing lights of a car approaches]",
        "RICHARD: Oh, fine.",

        "SECURITY OFFICER: Is there some sort of problem here, folks?",
        "RICHARD: No. There's no problem.",
        "SECURITY OFFICER: We got a call from some of your neighbors complaining about a disturbance.",
        "RICHARD: We apologize. We're going inside right now.",
        "EMILY: Do not tell me what to do.",
        "SECURITY OFFICER: Can I have your security password, please?",
        "RICHARD: [sarcasm] Look, it's getting late, so either shoot us or go away.",
        "SECURITY OFFICER: Fine. We'll just write up a report here and be on our way.",
        "EMILY: Are you happy, Richard? Now there's a report, and a report means we'll be in the police blotter. Petal Huffington reads the police blotter religiously. It's like heroin to her. You've turned us into the scandal of the neighborhood. [Officer exits.]",
        "RICHARD: Do you know what, Emily? If nothing else, this display tonight demonstrates clearly that you are no longer the woman I married.",
        "EMILY: The woman you married was your partner. You listened to her. You consulted with her. You respected her. So, you are right, Richard. I am definitely not the woman you married. [ Engine turns over as she exits to the house]",

        "[Lorelai enters and immediately sees Luke in the front sitting room. Kirk is propped face first on the sofa naked, his butt in the air and a blanket covering him. ]",
        "LORELAI: Oh, no.",
        "LUKE: It's okay.",
        "LORELAI: What happened?",
        "LUKE: He landed butt first in Taylor's rose bushes.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, poor thing!",
        "LUKE: Didn't slow him down, though. I managed to tackle him as he headed toward the miniature goat pen, dragged him back here, threw one of your blankets over him, and, well, there he is -- he's gonna be fine.",
        "LORELAI: Well, that's good.",
        "LUKE: Yeah. So, you were gone for a while.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, I just had some things to take care of at home. Are you sure he can breathe?",
        "LUKE: Oh, yeah, I propped his head up. ? [He notices she is distracted.] So, uh...you okay?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, I'm fine.",

        "[Luke and Lorelai approach Sookie]",
        "SOOKIE: I was just going to check on my loaves and make sure they're rising properly. The air's a little more humid than I thought it was going to be, and if the loaves aren't rising properly, then -- what are you doing? [They both pull Sookie closer to the sofa]",
        "LORELAI: We need you to look at Kirk's butt.",
        "SOOKIE: Why?",
        "LORELAI: Well, because he ran into some rose bushes, and he's got some thorns stuck in it, and I thought of you.",
        "SOOKIE: Me? Why me?",
        "LORELAI: Well, because... you're a chef.",
        "SOOKIE: What?",
        "LUKE: And you have a kid.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, that's better. You have a kid.",
        "LUKE: Neither of us has kids. Well, she does, but it's big and -- and -- and can look at her own butt.",

        "KIRK: They were after me, so I ran away.",
        "SOOKIE: Who was after you, honey?",
        "LUKE: Assassins. He thinks assassins are after him.",
        "KIRK: They were under my bed in my room, so I ran, and they followed me down the hall, down the stairs, past Luke and Lorelai kissing, through the yard, over that fence. [Sookie rolls her eyes and smiles in disbelief, Luke looks uncomfortable]",
        "SOOKIE: Well, the assassins are gone now, Kirk.",
        "KIRK: I imagined them?",
        "SOOKIE: I think so.",
        "KIRK: What about Luke kissing Lorelai?",
        "SOOKIE: [ Chuckles ] I think you imagined that, too. [she glances at Luke and does a double take when she sees his expression]",
        "KIRK: They looked so real.",
        "SOOKIE: Okay, Kirk, you just settle down and relax, and I'll be right back. [She drags Luke away from the sofa out of earshot.] Ohh. [ Gasps ] Oh, my God!",

        "SOOKIE: Ooh, Luke, that's wonderful! [pulls him into a big hug]",
        "LUKE: [ chuckles ] Thanks.",
        "SOOKIE: [giggling with excitement] I can't wait to tell Lorelai it's wonderful!",
        "LUKE: Um, could you maybe not say anything for a little while?",
        "SOOKIE: Why?",
        "LUKE: Well, I'm just not so sure she wants this out yet.",
        "SOOKIE: What makes you think that?",
        "LUKE: Do me a favor and keep it to yourself. Let her tell you if she wants to, okay?",

I mean he calls to tell me, and you answer, and he thinks maybe he doesn't have the right number, and he hangs up, and then I just lose out, which means we lose out. God, Lindsay, you know, you don't -- you don't get it, do you? I mean, you have absolutely no respect for me at all. That's just obvious.[ Sighs ]",
        "LINDSAY: I don't want to fight. We always fight. I won't answer your phone anymore. I was asleep. I didn't think. I'm sorry, okay?",
