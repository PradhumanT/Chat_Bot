        "LORELAI: Balkans.",

        "LORELAI: Ugh, I'll take any other subject in the world for two hundred Alex.",
        "RORY: Why don't you want to think about this?",
        "LORELAI: Because I haven't made my mind up about the yes or no part, so I don't want to start fantasizing about dresses and flowers or doves and tulle until I do, so please change the subject.",
        "RORY: I think the bridesmaids should be able to pick their own dresses.",
        "LORELAI: You know how on All in the Family when Edith would be yapping about something and Archie would pretend to make a noose and hang himself or shoot himself in the head?",
        "RORY: Yeah?",
        "LORELAI: I don't know. Something about this moment just made me think of that.",

        "LANE: Just give me a hint.",
        "MRS. KIM: Children will know what their parents think they can handle.",

        "RORY: Lane, come on.",
        "LANE: It's gonna be just like that Sally Field movie when her husband took them to Iran and wouldn't let them come back, except that I won't have to keep my head covered.",

        "RORY: Yes, I think you're freaking out a little prematurely.",
        "LANE: Oh really?",
        "RORY: Yes, I mean, let's think about this. Maybe there's some deal with the airline and that's why the ticket's one way. Or maybe they haven't worked out the plans with your cousins yet. Or there's a weather consideration or a holiday you don't know about or. . .Wow, I'm really gonna miss you.",

        "RORY: Tell him.",
        "LORELAI: Everything about me repulses that man. My coffee drinking, my eating habits. Remember when I called him Ranger Bob last week, he hated that!",

        "LORELAI: Oh, I don't know.",
        "LUKE: Crazy people. Whole town should be medicated and put in a rec room with ping pong tables and hand puppets. What?",
        "LORELAI: Nothing. I. . . well, I have something to tell you. No I have something to share with you actually.",
        "LUKE: To share with me.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, 'cause when exciting things happen in your life, you want to share them with the people in your life who you think will find them exciting, which I think you will.",
        "LUKE: What is it?",
        "LORELAI: Well, it's very. . .",

        "LUKE: Yeah, I figured.",
        "LORELAI: You did?",
        "LUKE: Well, it was obvious. You know, you too were getting kind of close. He was around a lot. Then last night with that life changing thing comment, you know, I put two and two together and figured it out.",
        "LORELAI: Oh.",
        "LUKE: Congratulations by the way.",

        "LORELAI: How do you know?",
        "LUKE: Well, you're making a big deal about telling me he proposed.",
        "LORELAI: Uh, I don't think I'm making a big deal.",
        "LUKE: And you wouldn't do that if you weren't gonna say yes.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, I'm sharing something with you. Sharing is not making a big deal, sharing is a nice gesture. Like when you're a kid and you have one of those popsicles and you break it in two and offer half to another kid. That is sharing, that is what I'm doing.",
        "LUKE: You offered me half a popsicle?",
        "LORELAI: Yes. Okay, so now you know.",
        "LUKE: Now I know.",
        "LORELAI: Uh, I guess I'll just have two blueberry muffins and some coffee.",
        "LUKE: Coming right up.",
        "LORELAI: Okay.",
        "LUKE: You know, I think it's good you're doing this.",
        "LORELAI: You do? Good, me too. I mean, not that I'm definitely doing it, but if I do, then it'll be good.",
        "LUKE: Where you gonna live?",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "LUKE: Here? Hartford?",
        "LORELAI: Here. I don't know, we haven't talked about it actually.",
        "LUKE: Hartford's probably good, closer to Rory's school.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, yeah, I guess.",
        "LUKE: Of course, it is a little far from the inn.",
        "LORELAI: Uh, yeah.",
        "LUKE: But who knows how long you'll work after you're married.",
        "LORELAI: Excuse me?",
        "LUKE: Oh, but you probably already talked about that, right?",
        "LORELAI: Uh, no, but I do think he and my father have come to an agreement on how many goats I'm worth.",
        "LUKE: Hey, I'm just talking here. It's great, really. You gonna have more kids?",
        "LORELAI: Hi, personal.",
        "LUKE: I mean, he wants kids right?",
        "LORELAI: In the world? Yes, he wants kids.",
        "LUKE: You haven't talked about that either.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, you know, what we have and have not discussed is none of your business.",
        "LUKE: Joint checking accounts?",
        "LORELAI: Luke!",
        "LUKE: You do know his last name don't you?",
        "LORELAI: I want my popsicle back.",
        "LUKE: Fine, it's your business.",
        "ORELAI: Yes it is. It's my business.",
        "LUKE: Hey, some people go their entire lives without having these kinds of conversations. My parents didn't discuss a damn thing my entire childhood. Worked fine for them. Of course, when my mom died she had to tell my dad where the coupon drawer was. Took him ten years to find it. Used a coffee can the whole time.",
        "LORELAI: Okay.",
        "LUKE: I don't care what anybody says, a coupon can is not as good as a coupon drawer.",
        "LORELAI: How are those muffins coming?",
        "LUKE: But you know what, you might like a coupon can. You never know. Here you go. Two blueberry muffins.",
        "LORELAI: Thank you.",
        "LUKE: And congratulations again.",

        "LORELAI: Fine, I'm just tied to the emergency break.",
        "RORY: How did you do that?",
        "LORELAI: With a flourish and a big ending. Okay, I got it. Let's go. Oh, my coat.",
        "RORY: It's pretty warm out for a coat.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, well, it tends to cool off the minute I get in that house.",
        "RORY: You good?",
        "LORELAI: I'm good. My keys.",
        "RORY: Mom.",
        "LORELAI: They're in the ignition. Okay, I got 'em. Let's go.",

        "LORELAI: Nothing.",

        "RORY: Mom.",
        "LORELAI: Oh look, doorbell. Pretty sound.",
        "RORY: You know, you always make me tell you what I'm thinking.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, and the lesson we have learned from that is you should never become a spy.",

        "EMILY: You're here. Richard, they're here.",
        "RICHARD: [from another room] Wonderful!",

        "LORELAI: Uh, no.",
        "EMILY: Why?",
        "LORELAI: Because you're scaring Rory.",
        "EMILY: Oh stop that. Get in here. Scaring Rory, you're so silly sometimes. Let's get you a drink. Put your coat down. Oh, and are you hungry? I had Antonia make some Roqueford puffs. Antonia, bring the puffs! Come, sit down, sit down. Richard!",
        "RICHARD: Say nothing until I get there.",

        "LORELAI: Mom, why don't you just tell us what's happening now?",
        "EMILY: Oh, all right. I can't wait for your grandfather any longer. Well, you know I'm very good friends with Bitty Charleston, the headmaster's wife.",
        "LORELAI: Mm Hmm.",
        "EMILY: Well, we had this little arrangement where she keeps me aprised of all the goings on at Chilton. You know, she tells me all the gossip on the students and their parents, and any piece of information I might find useful. Well, this afternoon she called to tell me the class list just came out, and Rory has finished in the top three percent!",
        "LORELAI: I know.",
        "EMILY: You do? Well, who do you know at Chilton?",
        "LORELAI: Um, Rory.",

        "RORY: Grandma, all of your dinners are special.",
        "EMILY: Well, this one will be extra special. We'll make all your favorite foods, and you can invite some of your friends.",
        "RICHARD: There's an excellent chance that presents might be involved.",
        "RORY: You guys do not have to do this.",
        "RICHARD: For the top three percent?",
        "EMILY: We most certainly do.",
        "RICHARD: You start late, have to catch up, and by the end of the year, you've overtaken everyone. A true Gilmore.",

        "MAX: Okay, but. . .",
        "LORELAI: And I have stuff. I have a lot of stuff. You haven't seen my closet yet, but you would not believe the amount of stuff one person can accumulate. I don't even know what this stuff is, but it's there and it's mine and it needs a place to live.",

        "MAX: Okay hold on.",
        "LORELAI: It's small and the teller's name is Margie and she can't count. And I think there's something so poetic about banking at a place where the teller can't count.",

        "LORELAI: What?",
        "MAX: Are you saying yes?",
        "LORELAI: Why are you asking me that?",
        "MAX: Because you call me, out of the blue, completely panicked about where we're gonna live and bank and coupon drawers and Margie.",
        "LORELAI: Well, these are important things to discuss.",
