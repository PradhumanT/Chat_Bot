        "LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "[Lorelai sits quietly at the kitchen table, feet up, cordless phone to her ear. Her eyes move back and forth over the floor. Switch to Rory's dorm. She is doing the same thing. Camera pans out back at Lorelai's to show that she is watching an automatic vacuum roll around. So is Rory.]",
        "LORELAI: So is this more or less fun than watching the same T.V. show at the same time?",
        "RORY: I think it's more.",
        "LORELAI: You know, if we died right now, and decomposed, it would vacuum us up and no one would ever know.",
        "RORY: Freaky.",

        "YALE DORMS - RORY'S COMMON ROOM",
        "[Paris enters from outside, wearing a pink bathrobe and toweling her hair.]",
        "PARIS [singing]: I'm walking on sunshine! Whoa! I'm walking on sunshine, whoa! I'm walking on sunshine, whoa! And don't it feel good! Hey, all right!",
        "[Rory emerges from her bedroom.]",
        "RORY: Hey!",
        "PARIS: What?",
        "RORY: Learn a new song, or I am tying you to a chair and putting Hotel Rwanda on again.",
        "PARIS: It's love, baby. Deal. [She brushes her hair.]",
        "RORY: You're not going to use that as a microphone, are you?",
        "PARIS: Oh, no, Reverend has the town band dancing and singing? [Paris grins.] I'm really happy.",
        "RORY: Doyle, I assume?",
        "PARIS: You know, he calls me his girlfriend now with no visible shaking.",
        "RORY: I'm happy you're happy.",
        "PARIS: So, how are things with Logan?",
        "RORY [smiling]: You want to hand me that hairbrush?",
        "PARIS: Look at us. We're happy, we have boyfriends! This is infinitely better than any mood stabilizer I have ever been on.",
        "[Someone knocks on the door.]",
        "RORY: Oh, shoot, what time is it?",
        "PARIS: It's Hammer time.",
        "RORY: It's Logan. Hairbrushes down.",
        "PARIS: You got it.",
        "[Rory walks over and opens the door.]",
        "LOGAN: Evening, Ace.",
        "RORY: Hi.",
        "[They kiss.]",
        "PARIS: Nice. Very nice.",
        "RORY: Hey, you want to see my room? It's far away from here.",
        "LOGAN: Super idea.",
        "[They go into her room and close the door. They kiss some more.]",
        "RORY: Hello.",
        "LOGAN: Hello.",
        "RORY: What are you thinking about?",
        "LOGAN: Whether or not you've ever woken up with Paris standing over you with a knife.",
        "RORY: Not recently. She's been in a good mood.",
        "LOGAN: Why is that?",
        "RORY: Because she's in love.",
        "LOGAN: With Doyle?",
        "RORY: Yes, with Doyle. And do not mock or make fun, because when Paris is happy, the whole world is happy. But when she's not happy, the whole world is Deadwood.",
        "LOGAN: Got it. You hungry?",
        "RORY: Yes, I'm starving. Just let me get my sweater. [She opens her closet.] Hey, what do you think of this dress? Does it look newspaper-y enough?",
        "LOGAN: What?",
        "RORY: I'm trying to figure out what to wear on my first day at the paper.",
        "LOGAN: Ah, the internship rears its ugly head again.",
        "RORY: I want to look professional but not too Lois Lane-y, and I don't want to look like a college kid.",
        "LOGAN: You are a college kid.",
        "RORY: Not on Monday. On Monday, I am a newspaper woman. And I have to look like a newspaper woman.",
        "LOGAN: Whatever you wear will be fine.",
        "RORY: I'm so excited. [She hangs up the dress.]",
        "LOGAN: I can tell.",
        "RORY: Oh. Last night, I couldn't sleep, so I Googled your father.",
        "LOGAN: Excuse me?",
        "RORY: Twelve thousand fifty three items came up. I could only pull up a couple thousand, but it really helped. [She holds up the stack of papers, flipping through them. Logan looks amused and a little disturbed.] He was born in 1953, Episcopalian, second of four children, oldest boy, Yale undergrad, star of the track team. No grad school. Interesting. Then he had a couple of lost years. Kind of a blank period, a little Jesus thing going on there. Worked as a reporter and editor for two of the Huntzberger papers before taking over as CEO of the company!",
        "LOGAN: Uh -",
        "RORY: I mean, when you look at all these accomplishments, the man must never sleep!",
        "LOGAN: Well -",
        "RORY: Ah. Mm-hm, four hours a night. Just like Clinton.",
        "LOGAN: You don't have a wall in a secret room with pictures of my father pasted all over it, do you?",
        "RORY: Logan, I'm going to be interning for him. I need to know everything about him. Is he an egghead? Because he seems very roll-up-the-sleeves-y. But he's written about everything, from foreign affairs, domestic policies. He had a wine column, for God's sake. I should learn more about wine.",
        "LOGAN: Look, Rory -",
        "RORY: What are his politics? He's unbelievably neutral in his writing! Right wing, left wing, middle wing. Oh, the man was short-listed for the Pulitzer for covering the Iranian hostage crisis when he was twenty-five!",
        "LOGAN: Yeah, I heard something about that.",
        "RORY: Twenty-five! How did he do that? Especially considering his lost years? He's a born journalist. I mean, what does he read? What papers, what journals? Come on, tell me something.",
        "LOGAN: He hates peas.",
        "RORY: Logan, I need your help here.",
        "LOGAN: Rory, my dad and I basically have two conversations. 'Logan, you're not living up to your potential' and 'Logan, when you're sailing close-hauled, wait until you gain that last bit of boat speed before you pull in the jib sheet.' That's it.",
        "RORY: But -",
        "LOGAN: Ace! You've learned more about my father in one night than I've learned in my whole life! Don't worry. You're going to be fine! Now, I thought we've established that we're both starving.",
        "RORY: Yes, we have. Let's go.",
        "[She puts down her notes on Mitchum, grabs her sweater and turns to leave. She remembers something else, and turns around to write it down.]",
        "RORY: Oh! Wait! Your dad covered Haiti in 1985. Must learn more about Haiti. Got it. Okay, let's go. Hey, have you ever discussed Pinochet with him? Because one time he wrote -",
        "LOGAN: Peas, Ace. Peas.",
        "RORY: Right. Sorry.",
        "[He directs her out the door.]",
        "YALE CLASSROOM",
        "[Rory and classmates sit around a large round table. The professor lectures.]",
        "PROFESSOR: As we move on from the empiricist to the rationalist, it would be good to start thinking about the differences between the A posteriori truths, and the Apriority truths of the rationalist, which exists independent of experience. So for Wednesday if you would all take a crack at the first five chapters of Spinoza's Ethics. That is, those of you who's entire weekend won't be consumed by books on wine and Haiti.",
        "[He gestures at the stack of reference books piled in front of Rory.]",
        "RORY: Yes. My interests are teasingly diverse.",
        "PROFESSOR: Whatever. See you all on Wednesday.",
        "[The students pack up their things. Rory's cell phone rings.]",
        "RORY: Hello?",
        "[Scene cuts from the classroom to Stars Hollow Street, where Lorelai is walking.]",
        "LORELAI: Ah, thank God. Did you return the blue sweater?",
        "RORY: Oh, no.",
        "LORELAI: Answer, please.",
        "RORY: Two days ago.",
        "LORELAI: Why?",
        "RORY: Why? Because two days ago you asked me to take it back. Demanded me, in fact.",
        "LORELAI: And suddenly you're just so freakin' reliable, you just hop to it and do whatever I say?",
        "RORY: I've always been freakin' reliable. It's how I was raised.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, so blame me.",
        "RORY: I am not returning the blue sweater again, so don't think about asking.",
        "LORELAI: But I want it, I need it.",
        "RORY: I've already returned the Capri pants twice. I've tried to return a couple of your other items that were all sales final, which makes me look retail simple. And this is not the first, but the second time I will have returned the blue sweater.",
        "LORELAI: Ooh, the Capri pants. Have you taken those back yet?",
        "RORY: I can't show my face in any stores in New Haven. They think I'm Paper Mooning them.",
        "LORELAI [proud]: Oh, she was very cute in Paper Moon. You're very cute, too.",
        "RORY: Calling me cute is not going to persuade me. And I have classes. A life.",
        "LORELAI: Monday afternoon. That's your free time, right? I remember some bragging to that effect. Go back on Monday.",
        "RORY: Oh. Well, Monday used to be free.",
        "LORELAI: Used to be? It's not free anymore?",
        "RORY: I guess we haven't talked in a couple of days. Um, I actually got an internship.",
        "LORELAI: Really?",
        "RORY: Kind of an important high-profile one.",
        "LORELAI: Wow! That's great!",
        "RORY: It's for a newspaper in Stamford that Logan's dad acquired. He offered me the spot himself.",
        "LORELAI: Logan's dad.",
        "RORY: Yeah. It was kind of out of the blue.",
        "LORELAI: So when did you hear?",
        "RORY: Just a few days ago. I forgot I hadn't told you, I start on Monday.",
        "LORELAI: Wow, congratulations!",
        "RORY: It's a pretty amazing opportunity.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, sounds like it. You'll be having lunch with the off-bet editors from the Times. Hanging out with Peter Jennings. Dan Rather will be valet parking your car.",
        "RORY: Yeah, it's more likely that I'll be pulling wire reports off the AP machine, but sure.",
        "LORELAI: Good, good. So, no worries on the blue sweater front.",
        "RORY: It's off my radar screen.",
        "LORELAI: Really? So you're really not going to make the effort?",
        "RORY: I'll see if I can swing by on Tuesday.",
        "LORELAI: Just send your assistant. You're getting an assistant, right?",
        "RORY: Oh, I'm sure. I'll see you Friday night.",
        "LORELAI: Bye, hon.",
        "RORY: Bye.",
        "STARS HOLLOW - TWICKHAM HOUSE",
        "[Luke walks into the diorama room.]",
        "LUKE: Taylor?",
        "TAYLOR [OS]: Hello, is someone out there?",
        "LUKE: Where are you, Taylor?",
        "TAYLOR [OS]: Over here! I can't move!",
        "[Luke wanders through the room, notices the horse mannequin with the Jebediah family on top of it. Taylor's hand waves from underneath the pile.]",
        "LUKE: Oh, I have got to get a camera.",
        "[He walks over to look at Taylor.]",
        "LUKE: How in the hell did you do this?",
        "TAYLOR: I was doing a little light dusting, and was toying with the idea of repositioning the horse's hindquarters, and the whole thing came tumbling down.",
        "LUKE: You can't leave anything alone, can you?",
        "TAYLOR: Are you going to help me, or not? I feel like I've been lying here for days.",
        "LUKE: You have not been lying here for days. Kirk came into the diner two hours ago.",
        "TAYLOR: You waited two hours to come and get me?",
        "LUKE: I have a business. I can't come running every time a family of mannequins decides to attack you.",
        "[He starts to lift the horse off of Taylor.]",
        "TAYLOR: Ow!",
        "LUKE: Just lie still.",
        "TAYLOR: Oh, this is so humiliating.",
        "LUKE: Taylor, don't you think it's time?",
        "TAYLOR: Time for what?",
        "LUKE: You've been trapped under the Jebediahs for two hours and no one has come in here.",
        "TAYLOR: What's your point, Luke?",
        "LUKE: My point is the museum's a bust.",
        "TAYLOR: Well, I'll admit. Attendance is low.",
        "LUKE: No one is coming!",
        "TAYLOR: I was reading an article about the power of bus bench ads for getting the word out. Very big in the music industry. Apparently the rapper, Fitty Cent, swears by them.",
        "LUKE: Taylor, come on. Isn't it time to sell? Let somebody who really wants this place have it!",
        "TAYLOR: I guess it is. I had such dreams.",
        "LUKE: There'll be other dreams.",
        "TAYLOR: I guess. You can resume your attempts to get me out of here.",
        "LUKE: You're definitely ready to sell the house?",
        "TAYLOR: Yes.",
        "LUKE: Then let's get you out of here.",
        "ELDER GILMORE'S HOUSE",
        "[Emily, Richard and Rory are eating dinner.]",
        "RORY: Tennis lessons? That sounds great, Grandma.",
        "EMILY: I've always liked tennis. And I have to say, I'm excited by the prospect of getting some good, healthy exercise.",
        "RICHARD: I'm excited by the prospect of those fetching tennis costumes.",
        "EMILY: Richard, not in front of Rory.",
        "RORY: Oh, I'm fairly worldly now, Grandma.",
        "RICHARD: She was a heck of a tennis player in her day. And very competitive.",
        "EMILY: I wasn't that competitive.",
        "RICHARD: This woman was kicked off the field hockey team in Smith for elbowing Ceci Everetts in the neck.",
        "EMILY: She got in my way.",
        "RICHARD: And this happened in the parking lot after the game.",
        "EMILY: Now, now. Rory, tell us a little more about this internship. It sounds very exciting.",
        "RORY: Well, all I really know is that I'm going to be shadowing Mitchum Huntzberger, just to sort of learn and observe, plus pitching in here and there.",
        "RICHARD: You are going to learn a hell of a lot.",
        "EMILY: It was very sweet of Logan to arrange this for you.",
        "RORY: Well, actually, Mitchum Huntzberger offered it to me himself.",
        "EMILY [impressed]: Really?",
        "RICHARD: Now, how about that? He just called you up? Your reputation for excellence preceded you?",
        "RORY: Well, he came by Yale, actually. I had met him when I had dinner at his house, and then -",
        "EMILY: Dinner? What dinner?",
        "RORY: Um, just a dinner that Logan took me to.",
        "RICHARD: At the Huntzbergers' house?",
        "RORY: Well, yes.",
        "EMILY: When? When?",
        "RORY: About a week ago, I guess.",
        "RICHARD: Good Lord.",
        "EMILY: Richard, it's already been a week!",
        "RICHARD: We need to invite him right away!",
        "RORY: Who?",
        "EMILY: Logan! The ball's been dropped!",
        "RICHARD: I'll put an invite in the mail first thing tomorrow.",
        "EMILY: We really should have had him over first. We probably should call him as well.",
        "RICHARD: We could messenger it in by tonight, it isn't even eight.",
        "RORY: Well, it's really nice of you to want to have him over, really, but you don't need to.",
        "EMILY: Rory, if you could mention it to him yourself, preferably tonight, I'll get a note over to him tomorrow.",
        "RICHARD: He'll need a choice of dates.",
        "EMILY: I'll get my book.",
        "RICHARD: I'll get mine, too.",
        "[They get up and rush off.]",
        "EMILY: Rory!",
        "RORY: Mm! Oh, call him now!",
        "RICHARD: Right now, right now, right now.",
        "RORY: Oh, okay!",
        "[She gets up and goes to the phone. Scene cuts between the Gilmore's living room and Logan's dorm, where he is reading on the couch.]",
        "LOGAN: Hello?",
        "RORY: Listen. You're going to be getting a note from the Gilmores sometime soon. Maybe in the mail, maybe hand delivered tonight. For all I know, a carrier pigeon is heading for your room as we speak. You might want to open your window.",
        "LOGAN: Why is a carrier pigeon heading here?",
        "RORY: They want to have you over for dinner.",
        "LOGAN: Oh.",
        "RORY: They're flipping out about it. She's sending an apology for being so remiss as to wait one whole week since I had dinner at your house to extend an invitation. I mean, they're losing it. So I'm calling to warn you, and, I want you to know, I didn't suggest us having dinner with them or encourage it in any way. And I definitely did not refer to you as my b-word in front of them or even imply it in any way. Because, you know, I'm really happy with the way things have been going and I don't want any pressure put on us, and I'm sorry, and I think I already said that, and that's it.",
        "LOGAN: What are the odds of getting out of this?",
        "RORY: Pretty much zero.",
        "LOGAN: Then let's do it.",
        "RORY: Really?",
        "LOGAN: Yeah, it won't be so bad.",
        "RORY: Well, you are a true gentleman. [She hears a bang from Logan's end of the phone.] Oh, my God, what was that?",
        "LOGAN: Carrier pigeon. Should have opened the window.",
        "RORY: Not funny.",
        "LOGAN: Kinda funny.",
        "RORY [smiling]: Bye.",
        "LOGAN: Bye.",
        "LUKE'S DINER",
        "[Luke serves Lorelai dinner.]",
        "LUKE : Burger rare, cheddar cheese, barbecue sauce on the side.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, hey, save Rory some lemon pie.",
        "LUKE: Rory's coming in tonight?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, she's going to see Lane's band play at Positively Four Street tonight. They have the coveted three in the morning slot.",
        "LUKE: I hear that's how Zeppelin started.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, her genius plan is to come home, go to bed early, set the clock for two, get up and go rock.",
        "LUKE: Solid plan.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, except that when the clock goes off at two, she will be dead asleep and won't hear it. I, however, will. I will then proceed to get up, drag myself downstairs, recreating a classic Zucker Brothers moment and then I'll shake her awake. She'll get up, throw on some jeans, a t-shirt, and no make-up and look like a Neutrogena ad, whereas once she leaves, I'll pass out on the couch, too exhausted to make it all the way upstairs, and in the morning I will have bags under my eyes that should have Tumi stamped on them. I love being a mom. [They see some men carrying a mannequin down the street.] Aw. Are the guys in town unusually lonely these days?",
        "LUKE: No, they're from the museum. I think they're getting ready to close it.",
        "LORELAI: Close it? No! Why?",
        "LUKE: Oh, well, you know, no one was going.",
        "LORELAI: I was going.",
        "LUKE: Oh, well, you went once.",
        "LORELAI: No, I was going to go again! Just as soon as the nightmares about the 'I love Jesus' mannequin subsided.",
        "LUKE: Well, you saw it once.",
        "LORELAI [sighs]: I guess.",
        "[Rory enters.]",
        "RORY: Here's your sweater, and I hope you're happy, because the saleswoman called me a name. Where's my pie?",
        "LORELAI: Luke! Pie!",
        "[She pulls the sweater out of the bag and wrinkles her nose.]",
        "LORELAI: What do we think?",
        "RORY: It's great.",
        "LORELAI: Huh.",
        "RORY: No.",
        "LORELAI: I thought it was light blue.",
        "RORY: No, it was dark blue.",
        "LORELAI: Oh. Did they have one that was light blue?",
        "RORY: You are officially banned from ever shopping in New Haven again.",
        "LORELAI: Well, thank God I have you to do it for me.",
        "[Luke brings over Rory's pie.]",
        "RORY: Hey, Luke. You're the only one I like around here at the moment.",
        "LUKE: Right back at you.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, so, other than your stylist duties, what else is going on in the life of the young and hopeful?",
        "RORY: I'm considering taking Russian.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, very practical. How's Logan?",
        "RORY: He's fine. Grandma and Grandpa invited him to dinner.",
        "LORELAI: You're kidding.",
        "RORY: It was actually less of an invite and more of a freak-out. They heard about the dinner I went to.",
        "LORELAI: Heard how much?",
        "RORY: The Reader's Digest version.",
        "LORELAI: Got it.",
        "RORY: Apparently they've already exceeded the polite reciprocal invite window, and if he doesn't come to dinner soon, Grandma has to give back her pearls.",
        "LORELAI: Wow. So, um, when is this dinner happening?",
        "RORY: Three dates were proposed. Logan's picking one of them.",
        "LORELAI: Huh. So it should be an interesting evening.",
        "RORY: Yep. I'll take notes and pictures.",
        "LORELAI: Cool, okay. You do that.",
        "LORELAI'S HOUSE - RORY'S BEDROOM",
        "[The digital clock says it is 12:30. Lorelai suddenly pounces on sleeping Rory. Rory whines.]",
        "LORELAI: I want to go to dinner.",
        "RORY: Where's the clock?",
        "LORELAI: I mean, you said that I could meet Logan properly, and you know how good I am when there's food involved!",
        "RORY: Twelve thirty!",
        "LORELAI: I mean, is there a reason I wasn't invited?",
        "RORY: Ah. Can't we talk about this tomorrow?",
        "LORELAI: It is tomorrow. I just don't think it's right that they get first dibs on him. I mean, I am your mom, and we are very close, in case you haven't heard, and I should get to know him first!",
        "RORY: Grandma and Grandpa already know him!",
        "LORELAI: Huh! Okay, so they have a head start! Fine. But I bet they won't know him, know him like I will know him if you let me go to dinner.",
        "RORY: I didn't think you'd want to come to dinner.",
        "LORELAI: Why not?",
        "RORY: Well, it's at their house, first of all, and I don't know how you feel about the Logan situation.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, this guy is in your life and I want to know him. Don't you want me to know him?",

        "RORY: Of course she'll be cool. She's the essence of cool. Cool's her street name. She's got it monogrammed on her towels and everything.",
        "LOGAN: Well, if she's got it monogrammed on her towels, there's nothing to worry about.",
        "[Rory rings the doorbell.]",
        "RORY: What'd you bring, anyway?",
        "LOGAN: Cigars for Richard, chocolates for Emily, and Mrs. Eleanor Shubick's silver lighter.",
        "RORY: Huh? What's that for?",
        "[Emily and Richard answer the door.]",
        "EMILY: Rory! Logan, welcome!",
        "RICHARD: Come in, come in!",
        "RORY: Hi, Grandma!",
        "EMILY: Hello! And our guest of honor.",
        "RICHARD: L'invit\u00e9 d'honneur.",
        "LOGAN: How are you, Richard? Emily?",
        "EMILY: Wonderful, now.",
        "RICHARD: Yes, wonderful.",
        "EMILY: Oh, look at you two, you're just perfect. Aren't they perfect, Richard?",
        "RICHARD: Perfect.",
        "RORY: We're not perfect.",
        "EMILY: Nonsense, you're perfect!",
        "LOGAN: No, she's right. I've got split ends like you wouldn't believe.",
        "[Emily and Richard laugh.]",
        "RICHARD: And a sense of humor.",
        "LOGAN: Emily, these are for you. A small token of my gratitude.",
        "EMILY: Vunderschen chocolates, I absolutely adore these!",
        "LOGAN: I picked them up last time I was in Switzerland.",
        "EMILY: Well, aren't you clever.",
        "LOGAN: And here's a little something for you, sir.",
        "RICHARD: Oh, Romeo y Julietas. You are a good man, Logan Huntzberger!",
        "EMILY: Come on, let's all go in the living room, shall we?",
        "[Emily takes Logan's arm, and Richard takes Rory's. They enter the living room.]",
        "EMILY: I just adore this jacket you're wearing. Isn't this a fine jacket, Richard?",
        "RICHARD: Oh, I like how the lapels are cut. Aren't those nice lapels, Rory?",
        "RORY: Uh, sure, Grandpa. His lapels look great.",
        "RICHARD: Most modern tailors cut lapels too low. It's so sloppy, having one's lapels hang down around the chest like a basset hound's ears or something.",
        "EMILY: But those are excellent.",
        "RICHARD: Oh, they really are.",
        "RORY [notices Lorelai]: Hi, Mom.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, how am I sitting?",
        "RORY: Great. Mom, you remember -",
        "EMILY: Logan, this is Rory's mother, Lorelai. Lorelai, this is Logan Huntzberger.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, we've met, actually. Nice to see you again, Logan.",
        "LOGAN: Nice to see you.",
        "EMILY: Come on, sit, sit, sit. Let's get drink orders.",
        "RICHARD: Mm.",
        "EMILY: Logan, what will you have?",
        "LOGAN: McKellen neat, if you have it.",
        "EMILY: Oh, I adore a man who drinks his scotch neat.",
        "RICHARD: That is a fine drink indeed.",
        "EMILY: Rory?",
        "RORY: Just club soda.",
        "EMILY: So demure. Isn't she demure?",
        "LOGAN: The demurest.",
        "RICHARD: One club soda.",
        "EMILY: And your usual, Lorelai? A sidecar?",
        "LORELAI: Sidecar? No.",
        "EMILY: Isn't that your drink?",
        "LORELAI: No, my drink is a martini. It's always been a martini.",
        "EMILY: Really?",
        "LORELAI: Yes. Pretty much every one of the other eight thousand times I've had a drink here it's been a martini.",
        "EMILY: I would've sworn you were a sidecar girl.",
        "LORELAI: Not even sure what's in a sidecar, Mom.",
        "EMILY: Well, Richard, apparently Lorelai would like a martini.",
        "RICHARD: Can do.",
        "EMILY: I just can't get over those lapels.",
        "RORY: Grandma and Grandpa are very taken with Logan's lapels.",
        "LORELAI: They look fine to me.",
        "EMILY: You'll have to excuse Lorelai, Logan. It takes a certain eye to be aware of this kind of thing.",
        "RICHARD: One scotch neat, and a club soda.",
        "LOGAN: Thank you.",
        "RORY: Thanks, Grandpa.",
        "RICHARD: And one martini. [He returns to the bar to make it.]",
        "EMILY: That's with a twist, Lorelai?",
        "LORELAI: Nope. An olive.",
        "EMILY: In a vodka martini?",
        "LORELAI: Not vodka, Mom. Gin. It's always been gin. Gin martini.",
        "EMILY: Really?",
        "LORELAI: Yes! Always!",
        "EMILY: I don't remember that at all.",
        "LORELAI: Uh, so. Logan. Where exactly do you live at Yale? Are you in Rory's building?",
        "LOGAN: No, I'm at Berkeley.",
        "LORELAI: Is that far from Rory?",
        "LOGAN: No, I'd say it's about ninety Kropogs or so.",
        "RICHARD: Kropogs! Did somebody say Kropogs?",
        "EMILY [laughing]: Kropogs. Now that is clever.",
        "[Everyone laughs.]",
        "LORELAI: Uh, fill me in here. What's a Kropog?",
        "LOGAN: Years ago, someone at Yale started measuring things based on the height of a kid named Kropog.",
        "RICHARD [sitting down]: I can't believe that today's Elis are still using Kropogs. Now that is really something. Maxwell T. Kropog was his name, class of forty-four. Oh, Lorelai, I'm sorry. I forgot your drink. I made it and everything.",
        "LORELAI: Well, you remembered now.",
        "[Richard starts to get up.]",
        "EMILY: No, Richard, stay, I'll get it.",
        "RICHARD: I'm glad to hear that Kropog is still part of the Yale vernacular. Tradition is so important.",
        "RORY: Why don't we talk about something other than Yale?",
        "EMILY: Nonsense, there's nothing better to talk about than Yale. Because Yale men are the greatest. I dated a few Princeton men and a Harvard man back in my day, and they had nothing on Yale men.",
        "RICHARD: They'd better not.",
        "EMILY [handing Lorelai her drink]: Here you go, Lorelai.",
        "[Lorelai takes the martini, looks at it, and looks back at Emily.]",
        "LORELAI: Mom, there's an onion in here.",
        "EMILY: Is that not what you wanted?",
        "LORELAI: Olive. I said olive.",
        "EMILY: Well, I heard onion.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I said olive.",
        "EMILY [glances at Logan and gets up]: Let me get you an olive.",
        "LATER",
        "[Lorelai sadly holds her empty martini glass.]",
        "EMILY: And the racquets have changed too. Honestly, the people at the club must have thought I was there to play badminton when I showed up with my old wooden thing.",
        "LOGAN: Oh, you have to get a new racquet, Emily. The materials available today make all the difference.",
        "RICHARD: I told her the same thing.",
        "LOGAN: I know this guy, he's one of the top manufacturers of ceramic racquets. Pete Sampras loves them. I could totally set you up.",
        "EMILY: Did you hear that, Richard? Logan can set me up!",
        "RICHARD: Well, how about that!",
        "BEATRICE [entering]: Dinner is ready, Mrs. Gilmore.",
        "RICHARD: Well, shall we?",
        "EMILY: I'm just going to pop into the kitchen to check on a thing or two. Richard, will you come carve the roast?",
        "RICHARD: Certainly.",
        "LORELAI: Is there going to be alcohol with dinner, Mom?",
        "EMILY: What?",
        "LORELAI: You know, booze? 'Cause I haven't been able to get even a Kropog of gin since that first drink.",
        "RICHARD: A Kropog is a unit of distance, Lorelai. Not volume.",
        "EMILY: And there'll be wine with the meal. There's always wine with the meal, Lorelai! Honestly! You're acting as if you've never been here.",
        "[Emily and Richard walk out.]",
        "LORELAI: Sorry. Just wasn't sure.",
        "[Rory, Logan and Lorelai stare awkwardly at the table.]",
        "LOGAN: Roast. Sounds good.",
        "RORY: It does.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah. Who doesn't like a good roast?",
        "[They get up to go into the dining room. Lorelai goes ahead, but is still within earshot. Logan holds Rory back.]",
        "RORY: What are you doing?",
        "LOGAN: A little Life and Death Brigade business. Every time we're in a rich person's house we take a knick-knack. Then I leave the knick-knack I took from the last rich person's house. I've been doing this up and down the eastern seaboard for years.",
        "[He picks up a small box from a table, replaces it with the lighter from his pocket, and takes the box. Lorelai sees this, and disapproves, but goes into the living room without saying anything.]",
        "RORY: Logan, no.",
        "LOGAN: Trust me. They never notice.",
        "RORY [smiling]: You're crazy!",
        "LOGAN: It's fun to be crazy.",
        "[They join Lorelai in the dining room.]",
        "RORY [referring to the chairs on the side of the table]: Grandma probably wants us here.",
        "EMILY [entering]: All right, the salads will be out in just a moment. Everybody, sit.",
        "[Emily walks around the table, then stops, staring at the living room.]",
        "EMILY: Wait a minute.",
        "RICHARD: What's wrong, Emily?",
        "EMILY [walking into the living room]: Well, I don't know. Wait. My antique sewing box! It's missing!",
        "RICHARD: Well, that can't be.",
        "EMILY: It is! It's gone! Was it here during drinks?",
        "RICHARD: Well, I can't say that I noticed.",
        "[Beatrice approaches.]",
        "EMILY: You, hovering there! What do you know about this?",
        "BEATRICE: Ma'am?",
        "EMILY: My antique sewing box. Did you move it somewhere?",
        "BEATRICE: No.",
        "EMILY: And yet it's not here. Do you have any explanation as to why it's not here, Beatrice?",
        "LORELAI [from the table]: I'm sure it's just a mix-up, Mom.",
        "EMILY: And - what's this? What's this lighter? Richard, is this from the pool house?",
        "[Lorelai glares across the table at Logan.]",
        "RICHARD: Well, I don't recognize it, but, well, you never know. One of the guys might have left it after a poker game.",
        "EMILY: Well, Beatrice. I don't know what to say. I almost feel like I should go through the whole house and make sure nothing else has been misplaced.",
        "LORELAI: Mom, I found it.",
        "EMILY [not hearing her]: However, we have company and I don't want to be rude.",
        "[Lorelai holds out her hand to Logan. He hesitates, and then gives her the box.]",
        "EMILY: Let's just leave it for later and then you and I will have a very serious discussion.",
        "LORELAI: Mom, I found it!",
        "EMILY: What?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, here it is.",
        "EMILY: Really? Where was it?",
        "LORELAI: Behind the centerpiece. I guess the flowers kind of hid it.",
        "EMILY: Behind the centerpiece?",
        "[Beatrice sees the box, and smiles.]",
        "EMILY: What on earth are you smiling about?",
        "BEATRICE: I'm just glad you found it.",
        "EMILY: Would you please go into the kitchen and bring out the salad course? [Beatrice leaves. Emily sits down.] Rory, Logan, I'm so sorry.",
        "RICHARD: Well, never a dull moment, as we say.",
        "EMILY: Ah, here we are. Avocado salad with beet dressing.",
        "[Beatrice serves the salad.]",
        "RICHARD: Oh, wonderful. I'm starving.",

        "LOGAN: Believe me, Rory's the real star at the Yale Daily News. People hate her.",

        "RORY: I'm not hated. Am I hated?",
        "LOGAN: She's had more pieces printed above the fold this year than anyone.",
        "RICHARD: Well, you are both enormously talented. Because if you have one tenth of your father's ability, young man, you are going to go straight to the top.",
        "EMILY: A power couple. That's what you are.",
        "RICHARD: We were thrilled to hear that Rory is going to be working with your father, Logan.",

        "RORY: I relax.",
        "EMILY: Speaking of relaxation, does your family still have their place on Martha's Vineyard?",
        "LOGAN: I think they bought it from Martha. They're not giving that up. It's not going anywhere.",
        "EMILY: It's lovely in the vineyard. A few years ago, Richard and I attended a wedding there. I thought there could be no more gorgeous a spot for a wedding.",
        "LOGAN: It's beautiful.",
        "EMILY: But then we went to one on Cape Cod and it was wonderful too. Either place would be good for a wedding, don't you think?",
        "[Lorelai glares.]",
        "LOGAN: Sure, I've been to weddings at the Cape myself.",
        "EMILY: So you like Cape Cod?",
        "LOGAN: Yes.",

        "EMILY: No. [To Logan] There are a lot of kids in your family, aren't there?",
        "LOGAN: Yeah. The extended family's been pretty busy procreating lately.",
        "RICHARD: They have, have they?",
        "EMILY: Do you like kids?",
        "LOGAN: Sure.",
        "EMILY: Kids love Cape Cod.",
        "LORELAI: I think internships are a Communist plot.",
        "RICHARD: What?",
        "LORELAI: Forcing someone to work without pay? It's a little Pinko, isn't it? I mean, where's Roy Cohn when you need him?",
        "EMILY: Have you lost your mind?",
        "LORELAI [shaking her head around]: No, no. It's still sloshing around up there.",

        "RORY: Oh, no thanks. They were really good, though.",
        "EMILY: How about you, Logan? Apple?",
        "LOGAN: Thank you, but I don't think I could eat another thing, and unfortunately we should be going. I have an early day tomorrow.",
        "EMILY: Oh, Logan, an early day. I'm so sorry we kept you.",
        "LOGAN: I wish I could stay longer.",

        "LOGAN [OS]: Oh, absolutely. I'll call you this week, or maybe I'll just shoot you an e-mail.",
        "EMILY [OS]: Shoot me an e-mail. That is so clever.",

        "[The door opens.]",
        "EMILY [OS]: Now, would you look at that! What a cunning little car! I adore sports coupes.",

        "[Emily and Richard sit down. Lorelai looks at Emily.]",
        "EMILY: What?",
        "LORELAI: Um, nothing. Just on those National Geographic shows, people are so sweaty after a mating ritual. But you two are powder dry.",
        "EMILY: What on earth are you talking about?",
        "LORELAI: They're just kids, and they're still figuring things out, and they don't need you two dropping all these heavy-handed hints about weddings and babies and Cape Cod.",
        "EMILY: You should be thrilled by this match, Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: Well, who says I'm not thrilled?",
        "RICHARD: Well, you're not acting very thrilled.",
        "LORELAI: I'm annoyed at you. That's why. Putting all this pressure on them? They are in their early twenties, for God's sake.",
        "EMILY: You are letting your own personal tastes cloud your judgment of this boy. He is perfect for Rory, and you don't see it!",
        "LORELAI: This is not about my personal taste!",
        "EMILY: You're uncomfortable around people like Logan. He's not your type. That's well documented.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, that was a nice not-so-subtle dig at Luke.",
        "EMILY: Luke?",
        "RICHARD: Who said anything about Luke?",
        "EMILY: You're very sensitive tonight.",
        "LORELAI: I'm not sensitive. It's just you're busy marrying Rory off into a family that wasn't even nice to her!",
        "RICHARD: Who wasn't nice to her?",
        "LORELAI: The Huntzbergers. She went over there for dinner and they treated her like trash.",
        "RICHARD: I highly doubt that.",
        "LORELAI: Well, they did!",
        "RICHARD: If the Huntzbergers were so horrible to Rory, why on earth did Mitchum give her a very valuable internship?",
        "LORELAI: He was buying her off.",
        "RICHARD: So, the internship was like hush money?",
        "LORELAI: Yes!",
        "RICHARD: There's no money! It's an unpaid position!",
        "LORELAI: It's a figure of speech.",
        "RICHARD: Rory got this internship by making a contact. In a way, similar to me setting you up with Mike Armstrong. Is there something wrong with that?",
        "LORELAI: No.",

        "LORELAI: There is still something wrong with this internship.",

        "RICHARD: They're perfect for each other!",
        "LORELAI: Okay, that word, perfect, he is not. I mean, no one is, okay, but especially him! I mean, at your wedding, I caught him and Rory in the back room [she hesitates] uh, kissing.",

        "LORELAI [with emphasis]: Kissing.",

        "EMILY: The sewing box is sitting on the table in the living room, Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: No, no. He's just a -",
        "RICHARD: Are we done here?",
        "LORELAI: No!",
        "RICHARD: Good. I have a call to make. You might want that cup of coffee. Clear your head a bit before you drive home. [He leaves the table.]",
