        "[Lorelai, Rory, and Emily are sitting at the dining room table]",
        "EMILY: Richard, please, we are starving!",
        "RICHARD: [calls from kitchen] I will be right there, Emily.",
        "EMILY: This is ridiculous.",
        "LORELAI: Mom, relax.",
        "EMILY: He woke up this morning and suddenly just had to have this dish that his grandmother would make him.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, we all understand the cravings.",
        "RICHARD: [calls] It's a family secret.",
        "EMILY: Well, last time I checked, I was family.",
        "RORY: He's having fun, Grandma.",
        "EMILY: I saw an open can of cream of mushroom soup. Nothing good can come of that.",
        "[Richard walks in carrying a casserole dish]",
        "RICHARD: Here we are, a treat for the masses.",
        "RORY: Smells good.",
        "RICHARD: Oh, this is my favorite thing to eat as a boy. My gran used to make this for me whenever I was feeling a little sad. You know, if my cricket team lost or a girl I fancied turned up her nose at me.",
        "LORELAI: Well, then load me up because there was this really cute chick at the pharmacy today. I used my best material on her and nothing.",
        "EMILY: Richard, at least let Pina serve it.",
        "LORELAI: No comment on my lesbian hilarity. My, how far we've come.",
        "RICHARD: Pina will serve tiny, proper servings. Johnny Machete needs to be presented in a heap.",
        "RORY: Johnny Machete?",
        "EMILY: That's the name of this vile concoction.",
        "RORY: It's delicious.",
        "LORELAI: It's not bad.",
        "EMILY: It's twelve different colors.",
        "LORELAI: Come on, Mom, eat it.",
        "EMILY: It looks like someone already did.",
        "RICHARD: Emily.",
        "EMILY: I'm sorry. I'm happy you're happy, and to prove it, I will take exactly three bites of this before I throw it out.",
        "RICHARD: Thank you.",
        "EMILY: You're welcome.",
        "RICHARD: So, good food, good company. Now, let's move onto good conversation. Rory, what is new in your life?",
        "RORY: Well, funny you should mention it. . .",
        "LORELAI: Now?",
        "RORY: Why not?",
        "LORELAI: Okay. Mom, Dad, we have some really big news.",
        "RORY: I got my college acceptance letters back.",
        "LORELAI: Harvard, Princeton, and Yale.",
        "RORY: And after giving it a lot of thought, I have decided. I'm going to Yale.",
        "LORELAI: Did you hear that \u0096 Yale!",
        "RORY: I'm going to Yale!",
        "LORELAI: That's where you went, Dad.",
        "RORY: You liked it, remember?",
        "EMILY: Pass the Johnny Machete, please.",
        "LORELAI: Pass the. . .",
        "RORY: I don't understand. I thought you wanted me to go to Yale.",
        "EMILY: No, we didn't.",
        "RICHARD: Absolutely not.",
        "EMILY: What gave you that idea?",
        "LORELAI: Mom, Dad, look, I know we've had our differences over where Rory should go to school, but that's behind us now. She's going to Yale, and that's good. Really good.",
        "RORY: Nothing but smiles.",
        "LORELAI: We're both very happy about it.",
        "RORY: Both.",
        "LORELAI: Her and me.",
        "RORY: She and I.",
        "LORELAI: Everybody in this room named Lorelai is over the moon about the \u0091going to Yale.'",
        "RORY: Which means that everybody else in this room not named Lorelai can be equally over the moon about the \u0091going to Yale.'",
        "RICHARD: I'm getting the champagne.",
        "EMILY: I'm calling the Talbotts.",
        "RICHARD: Oh, make sure you gloat over that dimwitted son of theirs who couldn't even get into Brown.",
        "EMILY: She's going to Yale!",
        "RICHARD: She's going to Yale!",
        "[they start to walk away, then both turn back to kiss Rory]",
        "RICHARD: When I get back, I'll teach you the fight song.",
        "[opening credits]",
        "CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN",
        "[Lorelai is in the lobby talking with the construction worker]",
        "LORELAI: So?",
        "TOM: It looks burned.",
        "LORELAI: Thank you. How long to make it not looked burned?",
        "TOM: Uh, geez, maybe two \u0096",
        "LORELAI: Tom, let me help you out. The answer I'm looking for is ten days because that's when I have to get guests back in here again.",
        "TOM: Okay, ten days.",
        "LORELAI: Are you lying to me?",
        "TOM: What's the answer you're looking for there?",
        "LORELAI: Never mind, just go fast.",
        "TOM: Go fast, huh? Never heard that one before.",
        "[Sookie walks over]",
        "SOOKIE: Well, everything's fine in the kitchen. We just have to get the gas line reconnected.",
        "LORELAI: How long's that gonna take?",
        "SOOKIE: I don't know. The plumber's in there now looking at everything.",
        "[Michel walks over]",
        "MICHEL: We forgot to call the Rappaports and they showed up.",
        "LORELAI: Oh my God, what did you do?",
        "MICHEL: Well, luckily they are not too bright so I convinced them they got their days mixed up and I sent them home.",
        "LORELAI: You sent them home? You didn't even try to get them a room somewhere else?",
        "MICHEL: You're welcome.",
        "LORELAI: [to worker] Hey Laura, try to track down the Rappaports and see if you can get them into the Bunnyhop Inn. Thanks. [to Michel and Sookie] Okay, grab a seat and let's get the meeting started.",
        "[a man walks into the lobby]",
        "TOBIN: I'm here, I brought bagels.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, Tobin, great. I'm starving.",
        "TOBIN: Normally I wouldn't think of it, because what bagel stands a chance next to Sookie's magical muffins and scones?",
        "SOOKIE: Oh, Tobin, stop!",
        "TOBIN: Two full pants sizes, my friend, all because of you.",
        "MICHEL: What is he doing here? He is the night manager \u0096 it's day.",
        "LORELAI: Michel, this is an emergency staff meeting, I need him here.",
        "MICHEL: I told you I cannot be in the same room with him.",
        "LORELAI: It's an hour out of your life, deal with it.",
        "TOBIN: Hold it. In case of soot. [spreads a handkerchief on the seat of Lorelai's chair]",
        "LORELAI: You're very sweet.",
        "TOBIN: Wait, wait. [wipes off the back of Lorelai's chair] Let's let the dry cleaners drum up their own business, huh?",
        "[Tobin starts to sit down]",
        "MICHEL: My chair!",
        "TOBIN: Oh, I'm sorry. [sits in another chair]",
        "[Michel sits down and scoots his chair close to Lorelai]",
        "LORELAI: Okay, so, should we get a room or what?",
        "MICHEL: Will you just start your meeting?",
        "LORELAI: All right. Here's the situation.",
        "TOBIN: Excuse me, Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah?",
        "TOBIN: Michel, did you get a bagel?",
        "MICHEL: I don't want a bagel.",
        "TOBIN: Are you sure? They're Kosher.",
        "MICHEL: I don't eat bagels. Bagels are like glue in your intestines and ensure that everything that enters your body will remain there until you die.",
        "SOOKIE: Ew, shut up.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, let's focus. As you know, the fire pretty much wiped out the dining room and five of the upstairs rooms.",
        "[Tobin sighs]",
        "LORELAI: Tobin, are you okay?",
        "TOBIN: I'm sorry, I just. . .I just love this place so much. I've been the night manager here for five years and I've spent so much time walking these halls, listening for friendly ghosts flying around, playing \u0096",
        "MICHEL: Make a point, bagel boy.",
        "TOBIN: It just hurts me to see it wounded, that's all.",
        "LORELAI: Well, it won't be wounded forever. We will rebuild and we'll be back and better than ever. We just need to keep it going until then. So I need some ideas on what to do.",
        "TOBIN: You know, I was thinking. . .I'm sorry, may I?",
        "MICHEL: No.",
        "LORELAI: Go ahead.",
        "TOBIN: Well, if we could get a celebrity in here, that would generate a lot of publicity.",
        "LORELAI: Hm. But how could we get a celebrity in here?",
        "TOBIN: I know Tony Randall and Renee Estevez. I'd be happy to put in a call.",
        "MICHEL: Okay. Look, I hate to bring this up, especially since \u0096 I mean, how do you top Renee Estevez? But we have a small number of rooms, yes?",
        "LORELAI: Yes.",
        "MICHEL: And the lobby's fine, and Sookie can make certain things at home \u0096 muffins, baked goods, jams, et cetera.",
        "LORELAI: So?",
        "MICHEL: So that's breakfast, and we have beds, and if we add some free wine and cheese around five in the afternoon. . .",
        "LORELAI: Uh, no. We're not becoming a bed and breakfast. Who's next?",
        "MICHEL: You're being stubborn.",
        "LORELAI: Bed and breakfasts are cutesy and annoying.",
        "SOOKIE: It forces people to mingle.",
        "LORELAI: I do not support the mingling.",
        "MICHEL: Adding a little gimmick will be an incentive for people to keep their reservations.",
        "TOBIN: You know what, I hate to say it, not being a B&B man myself, but Michel is making sense.",
        "MICHEL: Get off my side immediately.",
        "LORELAI: All right, I'll consider it.",
        "MICHEL: Sure, if he says it, you will consider it.",
        "[Tom walks over]",
        "TOM: I gotta show you something.",
        "LORELAI: Is it bad?",
        "TOM: No, it's great. You're gonna be thrilled, really. Warm up, cartwheels are coming.",
        "LORELAI: Keep talking. Be right back.",
        "[Lorelai starts following Tom. Tobin walks up to her]",
        "TOBIN: Excuse me, Lorelai? Listen, I know you're crazed right now, but I also remembered that your birthday is coming up on Friday, and well, I got you a little something.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, you didn't have to do that.",
        "TOBIN: It's very small.",
        "LORELAI: Tobin, I love candles.",
        "TOBIN: And it's scented, cappuccino.",
        "LORELAI: God, that smells great.",
        "TOBIN: I'm really glad you like it.",
        "LORELAI: I do, thanks.",
        "TOBIN: And listen, I'm the night manager here and I'm very proud to be the night manager, but with everything so wacky crazy around here right now, if you need some extra help during the day, please call me.",
        "LORELAI: I may take you up on that offer, Tobin. Thanks.",
        "[Lorelai walks away. Michel and Tobin share a look]",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "[Lorelai and Rory walk down the stairs into the living room]",
        "LORELAI: Stairs squeak.",
        "RORY: Stairs squeak.",
        "LORELAI: There's a chip on the banister.",
        "RORY: Chip on the banister.",
        "LORELAI: The paint's chipped in the archway, and there's a board loose in the entryway. Ooh, and the chimney needs to be swept.",
        "RORY: Mom.",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "RORY: Luke cannot sweep our chimney.",
        "LORELAI: Why not?",
        "RORY: Because you need to be a chimney sweep to sweep a chimney.",
        "LORELAI: Please. If Dick van Dyke can do it, so can Luke.",
        "RORY: Luke is going to be very sorry he ever made this offer to you.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, Luke has given me five free hours of handyman work for my birthday for the last five years.",
        "RORY: And you have grossly exploited that gift every year for the past four years.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I need to make up for that first year where I didn't milk it like I should've.",
        "RORY: The spirit of giving is completely lost on you.",
        "LORELAI: But the spirit of getting is alive and well and it wants its chimney swept. Ooh, put down laundry, too.",
        "RORY: Fine, then can he also build me another bookshelf?",
        "LORELAI: I've never been prouder of you than I am right at this moment.",
        "[the phone rings]",
        "RORY: And tell him to paint little flowers on it.",
        "LORELAI: \u0091Cause he's so good with the florals.",
        "[Lorelai walks toward the kitchen as Rory answers the phone]",
        "RORY: Hello?",
        "PARIS: I finished the paper on Dickinson, the Physics test was for a third grader, and I picked the history of the Egyptian political process as my International History project.",
        "RORY: You've been very busy.",
        "PARIS: I've been very bored.",
        "RORY: When are you coming back to school?",
        "PARIS: My parents return tomorrow. I think my mom's bringing home a new face.",
        "RORY: Really?",
        "PARIS: There's a doctor in France who injects some kind of gel into your head and then molds it to give you better cheekbones.",
        "RORY: You are kidding me.",
        "PARIS: She has to sleep on her back for a month, otherwise her face will flatten like a crepe.",
        "RORY: Oh my God, it's Brazil.",
        "PARIS: Anyway, I'll probably have to go back to school when they get home, so. . .",
        "RORY: It will be fine.",
        "PARIS: Are people still talking about my meltdown speech?",
        "RORY: No.",
        "PARIS: Great.",
        "RORY: Who cares what they're saying, Paris?",
        "PARIS: Just give me more homework, it will keep my mind off my life.",
        "RORY: There is no more homework. In fact, I think you've almost finished your first year of college.",
        "PARIS: Well, I just can't sit here thinking. I'll go crazy.",
        "RORY: Why don't you go out and do something fun?",
        "PARIS: Like what?",
        "RORY: I don't know, but it's your last day of freedom. Go be wild. Go crazy. Don't think, just do.",
        "PARIS: Do what?",
        "RORY: You're thinking.",
        "PARIS: But \u0096",
        "RORY: Still thinking.",
        "PARIS: What if \u0096",
        "RORY: Paris, don't think.",
        "PARIS: Okay, I won't think.",
        "RORY: I'll see you tomorrow.",
        "[hangs up and walks to the kitchen]",
        "LORELAI: Hey, do you think Luke can knock this wall out and build us a bigger kitchen in five hours?",
        "RORY: You'll have to drop the laundry.",
        "LORELAI: Never mind. Oh my God, I'm exhausted.",
        "RORY: Are you too exhausted to talk about birthday week?",
        "LORELAI: I'm never too tired to talk about birthday week.",
        "RORY: Okay, so, Monday I thought we'd start with facials at Sloopy's after school.",
        "LORELAI: Mudpack Monday, I love it.",
        "RORY: Then we'll have double feature Tuesday, Sephora Wednesday, complimentary makeover Thursday, and then, big fat fabulous Friday.",
        "LORELAI: D-day!",
        "RORY: BD-day!",
        "LORELAI: Culminating in the fabulous blowout of a party you're planning.",
        "RORY: Oh, I'm sorry, you wanted a party? I told everyone you didn't wanna make a big deal out of your birthday this year.",
        "LORELAI: You're not funny.",
        "RORY: Miss Patty and Babette wanted to hire these two hot guys to carry you around all day and feed you Bon-Bons, and Kirk wanted to hire the Red Hot Chili Peppers to play a concert in the square, but I said, \u0093Hey, please respect the lady's wishes. She deserves that at her age.\u0094",
        "LORELAI: Why are you so cruel to Mama?",
        "RORY: I have to go.",
        "LORELAI: Where?",
        "RORY: None of your business.",
        "LORELAI: You are planning something for Friday night, aren't you?",
        "RORY: I'll bring back Chinese for dinner.",
        "LORELAI: And you tell people no matter what they say, I just couldn't accept a new car. It would be beneath me and I'd be completely humiliated. And a convertible would just make me fling myself off a building.",
        "[the phone rings]",
        "RORY: Bye.",
        "LORELAI: Bye.",
        "[Rory leaves]",
        "LORELAI: [answers phone] Hello?",
        "KAREN: Lorelai Gilmore?",
        "LORELAI: You got her.",
        "KAREN: I'm calling from Richard Gilmore's office.",
        "LORELAI: Never heard of him.",
        "KAREN: Richard Gilmore, your father.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, tall, bow tie?",
        "KAREN: Yes.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, I'm with you now, go ahead.",
        "KAREN: Okay. Well, he'd like to set up an appointment to meet you for coffee. Would tomorrow work for you? Two o'clock?",
        "LORELAI: Well \u0096",
        "RICHARD: Make it three, Karen. I have that conference call at two.",
        "LORELAI: Is that my father?",
        "KAREN: Excuse me?",
        "LORELAI: Put him on the phone, please.",
        "KAREN: But \u0096",
        "LORELAI: Hand it over, honey.",
        "KAREN: I -",
        "LORELAI: Come on, let's go, chop chop.",
        "RICHARD: What are you doing?",
        "KAREN: She wants to talk to you.",
        "RICHARD: Just tell her I'll meet her tomorrow.",
        "KAREN: I tried, it didn't work.",
        "RICHARD: But I pay you to make my appointments.",
        "LORELAI: Dad!",
        "RICHARD: Lorelai, hello.",
        "LORELAI: Are you telling me that you were sitting right next to this woman while she called me?",
        "RICHARD: She is my secretary, Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: You were sitting right there?",
        "RICHARD: This is the way a proper business is conducted.",
        "LORELAI: Two feet from the phone?",
        "RICHARD: I'm not going to argue with you. Are you available tomorrow or not?",
        "LORELAI: What is this Dad?",
        "RICHARD: I have something I need to discuss with you.",
        "LORELAI: Well, discuss it now.",
        "RICHARD: I don't have the time now.",
        "LORELAI: Well, put Mrs. Huh-wiggins on the phone. Have her tell me.",
        "RICHARD: Please, Lorelai, can you meet me tomorrow at three o'clock or not?",
        "LORELAI: Fine, where?",
        "RICHARD: I will have Karen call you tomorrow to confirm it and tell you the place.",
        "LORELAI: Why can't you just tell me now?",
        "RICHARD: Leave me just a semblance of my structure, please.",
        "LORELAI: Fine. I'll talk to the woman sitting right next to you tomorrow.",
        "CUT TO WESTON'S BAKERY",
        "[Rory is at the counter placing an order]",
        "FRAN: So, that's a four foot chocolate cake with individual vanilla cupcakes on top spelling out \u0093Happy 16th Birthday Lorelai\u0094?",
        "RORY: That's right.",
        "FRAN: Would you like butter cream or whipped cream frosting on that?",
        "RORY: Can you do both?",
        "FRAN: That's a lot of frosting.",
        "RORY: I know, but it's my mom's favorite part. Once we tried to make a cake entirely out of frosting, which turned out to be better in theory than in actual execution.",
        "FRAN: Well, both frostings it is then. What time do you want to pick it up?",
        "RORY: Miss Patty will pick it up around five.",
        "FRAN: All right, you're all set.",
        "RORY: Thanks, Fran.",
        "[Lane walks in]",
        "LANE: We have a glitch.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LANE: Well, apparently, the world's largest pizza was 122 feet, 8 inches.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LANE: It says it right there.",
        "RORY: Well, obviously we can't do that.",
        "LANE: Obviously.",
        "RORY: So, then, we'll have to make it the largest pizza in Connecticut.",
        "LANE: Actually, Litchfield made one last year that was 98 feet.",
        "RORY: Pete said the biggest they could do was a twelve footer.",
        "LANE: Maybe you could make her the world's biggest something else.",
        "RORY: Like what?",
        "LANE: I don't know. Taco?",
        "RORY: I think the world's biggest taco would be a little difficult to serve, don't you?",
        "LANE: Well, it would definitely be more of a commitment.",
        "RORY: We'll just have to tell her it's the world's biggest pizza.",
        "LANE: Lie to her on her birthday?",
        "RORY: It's for her own good. So, how's the music selection coming?",
        "LANE: Good. I've decided to choose one song from each year in Lorelai's life. I'm almost done, though I've hit a snag in 1974.",
        "RORY: Bad year?",

So last night I pulled out the old Time Life series, and I have to admit, there's some pretty terrific ideas in here. For example, we can putty up the cracks in the drywall and then give the lower part of the wall a good coat of paint. Then we can take a strip of wallpaper, put it around the top, thus creating sort of a border, if you will. Also, I gathered up all the broken China from the dining room because I read here in Martha that chipped teacups make great votive holders, and we all know, when in doubt, it's candles, candles, candles, right? So I cleaned them up, filled them with tealights, and I think they look terrific. Oh, the pieces that were too far gone to save, I just smashed them up and used the pieces to make this nice picture frame.",

So last night I pulled out the old Time Life series, and I have to admit, there's some pretty terrific ideas in here. For example, we can putty up the cracks in the drywall and then give the lower part of the wall a good coat of paint. Then we can take a strip of wallpaper, put it around the top, thus creating sort of a border, if you will. Also, I gathered up all the broken China from the dining room because I read here in Martha that chipped teacups make great votive holders, and we all know, when in doubt, it's candles, candles, candles, right? So I cleaned them up, filled them with tealights, and I think they look terrific. Oh, the pieces that were too far gone to save, I just smashed them up and used the pieces to make this nice picture frame."
