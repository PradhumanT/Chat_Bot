        "Luke has his hands full as family members return to Stars Hollow: Liz for her high school reunion and Jess for his car. Lane busies herself at Yale by being the suite's Helpful Hannah. Lorelai agrees to accompany Jason on an office furniture shopping trip on his morning off, but the press of international business calls keeps getting in the way. Jamie's in town, and Paris keeps avoiding him. Lorelai and Jason agree that Emily and Richard need to be told about their relationship, but Lorelai just can't bring herself to do it after Emily mocks both Jason and the idea that he would ever hit it off with her daughter. Rory's finally speaking her mind on Paris's romantic entanglements backfires when Paris decides she has a future with Asher and breaks up with Jamie. Rory becomes concerned that her mother is having financial problems. When Lorelai and Rory discover Jess sleeping in his car in the freezing cold after an argument with his uncle, Lorelai intercedes on his behalf with Luke, who relents and allows Jess to come inside while Luke spends the night in Litchfield."

        "[Lorelai walks down the sidewalk past people putting up decorations on streetlight for upcoming Firelight Festival. She enters Luke's Diner to find busy lunch hour customers everywhere.]",
        "LORELAI: Unbelievable. [she pulls her cell phone from her pocket and hits speed dial]",
        "CUT TO RORY'S DORM BEDROOM",
        "RORY: Hello?",
        "[Scenes change from dorm to diner]",
        "LORELAI: There are no empty tables at Luke's.",
        "RORY'S VOICE: And I can do what about that?",
        "LORELAI: Well, I was hoping you'd develop mind control powers since I last saw you and you could will people to leave.",
        "RORY: No. If I could do that, I'd be using it to play the ponies or something. Your table would be low on the list.",
        "LORELAI: Selfish! [she looks around and sees Kirk alone at a table] Ooh, hold on a sec. [approaches Kirk] Kirk, may I?",
        "KIRK: May you what?",
        "LORELAI: Sit with you?",
        "KIRK: Here?",
        "LORELAI: Yes.",
        "KIRK: I have a girlfriend.",
        "LORELAI: I'm not flirting with you Kirk.",
        "KIRK: Oh. Then, have a seat.",

        "KIRK: It's an Arnold Palmer.",
        "LORELAI: That was flirting.",
        "KIRK: Oh, man. [looks uncomfortably around]",
        "LORELAI: [returns to her cell phone call with Rory now ignoring Kirk] I'm back. So, what's going on with Lane?",
        "RORY: She's here. She's fine. She's uh, still a little bit in denial. She hasn't talked to her mom since the kick-out.",
        "LORELAI: Poor Mrs. Kim.",
        "RORY: Poor Mrs. Kim? She kicked Lane out, I'm mad at her.",
        "LORELAI: Why? She must be very lonely without Lane.",
        "RORY: Well, Lane's getting along pretty well here. She kind of fallen into a - rhythm. [Lane rushes into the bedroom with travel tray of coffee] Hey.",
        "LANE: Hey, Take. [she offers coffee tray to Rory]",
        "RORY: Thanks you. Hey, you're out of breath.",
        "LANE: There were incredibly slow people in the coffee line, and I promised to wake Paris. [hurries over to Paris' bed] Up and at 'em!",
        "PARIS: Die.",
        "LANE: I got you a triple espresso that I'm going to put here right out of reach, so sleepyhead has to get up to get it.",
        "PARIS: Die twice.",
        "LORELAI: Was she at the professor's again last night?",
        "RORY: Yes, but she claims she was up all night cramming.",
        "LORELAI'S VOICE: Well, she was.",
        "RORY: Oh, ick!",
        "PARIS: [eavesdropping] Ick what? Are you talking about me? Who is that?",
        "RORY: It's my mom. We're not talking about you. You're so paranoid.",
        "LORELAI: Uh, hold on a sec. Luke's here.",
        "LUKE: [grumpy] I swear, it feels like these stupid Firelight Festivals happen every week.",
        "LORELAI: And a happy, happy to you too.",
        "LUKE: Order please.",
        "LORELAI: Coffee and whatever muffin you have.",

        "CUT TO DORM",
        "RORY: [loads her book bag while talking] You never told me why you're up so early.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I've got a quick meeting at the Dragonfly, and then Jason is coming here for the day.",
        "RORY: [disbelief] Jason?",
        "LORELAI: He's taking the morning off, so I'm taking him shopping for new furniture for his office.",
        "RORY: Sounds fun.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah. He's never really seen Stars Hollow, so I uh - [quickly hushes as Luke returns to table to fill her coffee cup]",
        "RORY: [she finishes Lorelai's sentence]...get to - show him around, right?",
        "[Luke pours coffee]",
        "LORELAI: Hm. Um-hm.",
        "LUKE: Did I interrupt something?",
        "LORELAI: No.",
        "LUKE: Would my reminding you of the cell phone policy affect your behavior in anyway?",
        "[Lorelai hold up her cell phone to the vicinity of Luke's face]",
        "LORELAI: It's Rory.",
        "LUKE: [he leans closer to the phone] Hello Rory! [to Kirk] How does it feel to be a step-dad?",
        "KIRK: [scolding] Knock it off. [Luke walks away]",
        "RORY'S VOICE: Gooood thinking.",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "RORY: Clamming up. He's always had a problem with your guys. Best to ease into it.",
        "LORELAI: Oh. No, no that's not why I stopped talking.",
        "CUT TO YALE DORM ROOM",
        "[Paris is now sitting up in bed taking first gulp of her espresso, Lane standing near by]",

        "CUT BACK TO LUKE'S DINER",
        "LORELAI: What was that?",
        "RORY'S VOICE: Paris. She likes to do this thing in the morning with the triple espresso. It's like Jack Nicholson in Easy Rider.",
        "PARIS: [leaps to her feet] Jumping Cattle Hockey!",
        "RORY: Hey Paris, can you take this somewhere else, please?",
        "LORELAI: Ahh, wait, wait, wait. We got a little something else goin' on here -- [An oddly dressed woman stands at the counter talking animatedly]",
        "RORY: What's going on?",
        "LORELAI: A kinda odd rock-and-roll, hippy-chick came in, she's deep in conversation with Luke, who is not looking too happy --",
        "RORY'S VOICE: What are they saying?",
        "LORELAI: Uh, they are rudely out of range. [to Kirk in a sweet voice] Hey hun, hun? Try to move in so you can hear 'em. Go.[motioning him to move closer to Luke]",
        "KIRK: [With a nervous chuckle he says to anyone in earshot] She's joking. We're just friends, ha-ha.",
        "RORY: A mystery woman!",
        "LORELAI: Maybe she has something to do with his apartment? I mean he might be leasing out whichever one he's not using, or it's about his divorce with Nicole or the lack of one if the divorce is definitely off.",
        "RORY: Or maybe she's a friend of Nicole's or another attorney if it's not definitely off.",
        "[In the background, Lane straightens Paris' bed covers smoothly.]",
        "LORELAI: Wait, Luke is the most complicated guy I know who also owns a Doobie Brothers record.",
        "PARIS: [off camera] Sweet Mamma Jamma!",
        "LANE: Oh! I've gotta wake Tanna. [rushes off]",
        "LORELAI: Wait, wait... denoument! [whispers into her phone] He sent her upstairs!",
        "RORY: Weird!",
        "LORELAI: So what do you think? An early morning tryst with the county dominatrix?",
        "RORY: [she takes a sip of her coffee] Hmm, does she have a bag?",
        "LORELAI: No.",
        "RORY: Then where would all her dominatrix stuff be?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, maybe they're using all the stuff he keeps on hand?",
        "RORY: Fishing pole?",
        "LORELAI: Nolan Ryan's rookie card?",
        "RORY: Mystery!",
        "LORELAI: Mystery!",
        "RORY: Go ask him!",
        "PARIS: [off camera] Who's yer daddy!",
        "LORELAI: [disappointed] He's in back.",
        "RORY: So go back there and ask him! I have to know what's going on.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. [loud crashing noise comes from the storeroom]",
        "LUKE: [off camera] Aww, crap, crap crap!",
        "LORELAI: Oh, maybe later, I don't think now is such a good time. I'll talk to you later.",
        "RORY: Later.",
        "[Lorelai puts her cell phone away and begins pouting and sighing at Kirk. He looks back dumbly. Lorelai winks and begins making loud kissing noises.]",

        "LANE: Your stylist concurs.",
        "[Rory enters from the bedroom looking around the common room.]",
        "RORY: Wow, so organized out here.",
        "LANE: I tidied up a little. Excess stuff went into the cabinet.",
        "PARIS: [enters] Impressive.",
        "[phone rings from bedroom]",
        "RORY: I'll get it. [exits]",
        "TANNA: [to Paris] How good do I look?",
        "PARIS: Would a comedic reply crush you?",
        "TANNA: [pause] Probably.",
        "PARIS: Terrif.",
        "RORY: [from bedroom] Where's the phone?",
        "PARIS: Buried somewhere.",
        "LANE: [proudly] Tanna's gonna knock boys out today.",
        "PARIS: With what? Sheer peculiarity?",
        "TANNA: I am hoping that one boy notices. Chester Fleet.",
        "LANE: Chester Fleet?",
        "TANNA: His father was instrumental in conducting research showing that neurons in the brain fire actively during REM sleep - with the exception of nerve cells involved with the transmitter chemicals serotonin and norepinephrine.",
        "PARIS: I'd forgot the first part of that sentence by the time you finished, but I say jump him.",
        "TANNA: [uncomfortable] Thanks Lane. See ya later. [she leaves]",
        "RORY: [enters from the bedroom] Finally. [answers the phone] Hello?",
        "JAMIE: Hi Rory, its Jamie. How you doin'?",
        "RORY: Good Jamie. It's been a while. How's the second best school in the country?",
        "JAMIE: Princeton's fine. Hard, not as easy as slacker schools like Yale.",
        "RORY: I'm assuming you're looking for Paris?",
        "JAMIE: Yeah. I'm actually in town for a couple of days, so I'll probably see you at some point.",
        "RORY: Great. Here she is. [she hands the phone to Paris and prepares to exit.]",
        "PARIS: [briskly]Hey, I was just stepping out the door, what's up? [pause] Fine. [pause] Your hotel room's good? [pause] Good. [pause] Well, probably not tonight, unfortunately. Things are really bad on my end. [pause] I know, I'm so sorry but tonight was tentative, remember? Tonight wasn't set in stone. [pause] Well, I'm - dead tired, I have tons of studying to do and we have a little drama going on here at the suite. Rory's small town friend, Lane, is crashing in with us. She got kicked out of her house, and she's in pretty bad shape. She's pretty heavy into the drugs, totally Nancy Spungening it, chasing the dragon, and I kind of have to be here for support. The chick's bouncing off the walls. [pause] Yeah. Tomorrow, sure, absolutely. [pause] Tonight was tentative, Jamie, I'm sure I told you to pencil it in. Pencil. Okay, bye. [Paris clicks off the phone while both Lane and Rory are frowning at her]",
        "PARIS: What?",
        "RORY: Nothing.",
        "PARIS: I had to say something like that. He doesn't always respond to the fact that I have to study, which I do, you know that.",
        "RORY: Oh, sure.",
        "PARIS: And I'm seeing him tomorrow anyway.",
        "LANE: What's \"chasing the dragon?\"",
        "PARIS: I've gotta go [walks off with Lane pursuing]",
        "LANE: But I don't think you should be saying that. [far away] it might get around and I don't...",
        "CUT TO STARS HOLLOW WET STREETS",
        "[Luke is driving his truck with an annoying tail-gaiter behind him. The black sports car's horn honks, with it's lights flashing - obviously in a hurry]",
        "LUKE: Hey, take it easy! [Luke eventually pulls over to curb, and the flashy car roars past. Luke exits his truck.] Jerk!",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S LIVING ROOM",
        "[Lorelai is sitting with her purse in lap, waiting. She checks a nearby clock then wanders to her front window and looks out. To her dismay, she sees Jason's black sports car is parked in the driveway with Jason inside.]",
        "CUT TO OUTSIDE LORELAI'S FRONT DOOR.",
        "[Lorelai approaches Jason's car with muffled sounds of Japanese voices coming from inside. Jason is on a business conference call via his car's speaker-phone. She softly taps the window glass. Jason lowers the window and motions for quiet from Lorelai. The voices sound increasingly agitated.]",
        "JASON: Gentleman, gentlemen. There is no way to one hundred percent avoid liability for on-site accidents at any of your plants. It is unfortunate, but international accords preclude it. Uh, can you please translate Mr. Watanabi?",
        "MR. WATANABI VOICE: Okay - [continues in Japanese]",
        "JASON: [whispering] I'm sorry.",
        "LORELAI: What happed to taking the morning off?",
        "JASON: I have the morning off. Japan does not have the morning off. Here. [pats the seat next to him] Care to join me?",
        "LORELAI: With all those Japanese business men in the car? Kinky.",
        "MR. WATANABI VOICE: Kinky? I'm sorry, what is kinky?",
        "JASON: Uh, y-you don't have to translate that, Mr. Watanabi. Where are we?",
        "MR. WATANABI VOICE: They must confer.",
        "JASON: [under his breath] Oh, they really dig conferring. [normal tone] Please tell them that I will call them again tomorrow. Minna-san domo arigato. Gozaimasu.",
        "MR. MIDI VOICE: [responds politely in Japanese and disconnects transmission]",
        "JASON: Here come on, get in here. It's cold out side.",
        "LORELAI: I thought we'd take my Jeep. It holds more stuff.",
        "JASON: That's good thinking. [he gets out of the black Mercedes and gives Lorelai and brief but warm kiss] Hello.",
        "LORELAI: Hello.",
        "JASON: So, where are we off today?",
        "LORELAI: Well, I've got a fabulous little list here. [she pats her purse] Lots of places in neighboring Woodbury and we'll have to get a newspaper.",
        "JASON: For --",
        "LORELAI: -- finding dead people.",
        "JASON: Ah, estate sales, got it.",
        "LORELAI: Then we can come back, hit a few places here and then grab some lunch.",
        "JASON: Do we have time for coffee now? I haven't had any for hours.",
        "LORELAI: For hours? When did you get up?",
        "JASON: Five.",
        "LORELAI: Wow, they have one of those in the morning too?",
        "JASON: You know how Asia is not taking the morning off? Neither is Europe.",
        "LORELAI: Well, coffee, it is then.",
        "JASON: How about you taking me to that place you're always talking about. What is it, um - Duke's.",
        "LORELAI: [chuckles] Duke's. Sure. Or, uh, we could go some place else.",
        "JASON: Why? Why not Duke's?",
        "LORELAI: It's not so special.",
        "JASON: You go there daily.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, but I think Duke's is closed... and it's Luke's.",
        "JASON: Closed at eight in the morning on a Friday?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah. Sabbath.",
        "JASON: Duke's a Jew.",
        "LORELAI: No, Luke's a Jew.",
        "JASON: Sabbath's not 'til sundown.",
        "LORELAI: Well, he likes to get an early jump on his - Sabbathing.",
        "JASON: I bet he's open.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, but we run the risk of going and then discovering it's closed.",
        "JASON: Well, I say live dangerously or not at all.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah. Yeah, you're right. All the other coffee in town sucks. Let's just go to Duke's - which is Luke's.",
        "JASON: Which is Luke's?",
        "LORELAI: [grinning] Dukes.",
        "JASON: What? [Lorelai giggles]",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S JEEP IN STARS HOLLOW TRAFFIC",
        "[Jason is talking on cell phone while Lorelai drives]",
        "JASON: No, no Rietgaard, those documents were Fed-Ex'd to you on Wednesday. Uh, the dok-umen-ten were Fed-Ex'd, on - aw, shoot, on... Monday is maandag, Tuesday is dinsdag... [to Lorelai] How's your Dutch?",
        "LORELAI: Oh great. I just don't like to share it.",
        "JASON: I'll just have the office fax it all over to you today. It's okay.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, is he ice-skating under a windmill, that's the picture I have in my head.",
        "JASON: Okay, Rietgaard, good bye. Bye. [closes cell phone and sighs] I am exhausted.",
        "LORELAI: Aww, and on your morning off!",
        "JASON: Yeah, I stink at taking mornings off.",
        "LORELAI: Well, here we are. [she pulls up in front of Luke's diner and turns off Jeep]",
        "JASON: Ahh, wait.[A pause as he recognizes Luke's green truck across the street]",
        "LORELAI: No more calls.",
        "JASON: Whose truck is that? [pointing] Duke's?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, Luke's.",
        "JASON: Are they different people?",
        "LORELAI: Same person.",
        "JASON: And that's his truck.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, it's practically an appendage.",
        "JASON: [Indicating the familiar diner owner through the window] Sooooo, that would be Luke.",
        "LORELAI: Boy, you sure like to do a lot of research before getting a cup of coffee. That's the doorknob. It twists to the right. C'mon. [starts to remove safety belt]",
        "JASON: Ahhh -",
        "LORELAI: What is with you?",
        "JASON: Yeah, I'm not in the mood for coffee anymore.",
        "LORELAI: [gasps at the obvious lie] You were jonesing not 5 minutes ago.",
        "JASON: No, it's passed. My 5 a.m. coffee just kicked in again.",
        "LORELAI: You drink time-released coffee?",
        "JASON: [shrugs] It's all the rage.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. Well, I want coffee. [pulls off safety belt and prepares to get out]",
        "JASON: Okay, I'll wait for you here.",
        "LORELAI: What is with you?",
        "JASON: [Pause] I-I was kind of tailgating Duke on the drive in.",
        "LORELAI: You were tailgating Luke?",
        "JASON: Pretty rudely. There was honking.",
        "LORELAI: Aw, geez.",
        "JASON: Well, I didn't know it was Duke.",
        "LORELAI: How fast was he going?",
        "JASON: Snail's speed. Like twenty.",
        "LORELAI: The speed limit here is twelve!",
        "JASON: Okay See this is one of the problems I have with small towns - proximity. [During Jason's rant, Luke looks out the window, recognizes Lorelai's jeep out front. Looking closer he sees a man sitting next to her] You tailgate a guy in Manhattan and you never see him again, you tailgate a guy in a small town, he is the keeper of the coffee. [He looks over at the diner window]. And he is looking at us!",
        "LORELAI: Who Luke?",
        "JASON: Is that his name?",
        "LORELAI: YES! [she peers past Jason to see Luke]",
        "JASON: Okay, don't look at him! Don't look at him!",
        "LORELAI: This is ridiculous!",
        "JASON: Okay go, go, go! [motions for her to drive away]",
        "LORELAI: Where?!",
        "JASON: Anywhere - else - for coffee, please.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. [starts up the engine and drives 5 feet and stops]",
        "JASON: Why are we stopping?",
        "LORELAI: Um, the next best place for coffee is at this place. [pointing to the next building]",
        "JASON: Okay Please find us coffee at least fifty yards away from Duke's.",
        "LORELAI: [mocking] Oh, oh okay finding coffee fifty yards from Luke's is another matter. [they drive away]",

        "JAMIE: Sorry to pounce on you like that.",
        "RORY: That's okay, you're not pouncing. Wanna sit? [she sets her lunch tray on table]",
        "JAMIE: Thanks. [they both sit] Listen, do you - ?",
        "RORY: Do I what?",
        "JAMIE: Look, I need to find out what's up with Paris, and I don't know who else to ask.",
        "RORY: Oh.",
        "JAMIE: I mean, I had to rearrange a million things to come here, and I could only manage two days and she won't see me.",
        "RORY: Well, you're going to see her tomorrow, aren't you?",
        "JAMIE: If she doesn't cancel.",
        "RORY: She's not going to cancel. [Jamie gives her a doubtful look] She wouldn't.",
        "JAMIE: Well, she's been canceling plans for weeks. She's not calling me as much - I know, I sound pathetic.",
        "RORY: No you don't, and Paris has been so busy. You've been a freshman in college, you know what that entails.",
        "JAMIE: Yeah. [unconvinced]",
        "RORY: Plus, I heard her telling you about my friend, Lane. She's been living in our suite and it's been really unfair to all my roommates.",
        "JAMIE: What is \"chasing the dragon?\"",
        "RORY: I don't know, but that's what Lane says she's been doing. She's in cold turkey now - going it, I mean - cold turkey and -- um -- Paris has been really great helping out.",
        "JAMIE: Has she been seeing someone else?",
        "RORY: [shrugs] Not that I know of.",
        "JAMIE: [smiles and rises to go] I'll let you go. Thanks, this actually helped.",
        "RORY: Good. It will get better, Jamie. I really think that.",
        "JAMIE: Good. [backs away] It's my birthday.",
