        "OPEN IN STARS HOLLOW - SIDEWALK OUTSIDE DOOSE'S MARKET",
        "[Lorelai appears around the corner and prepares to enter the grocery store.]",
        "JACKSON: [loud whisper OS] Psst! Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: Jackson.",
        "[She spots him hiding on the side of the building. He's curiously dressed in a thick coat and a concealing lumberjack hat - flaps arranged to hide his face. She is intrigued and approaches him.]",
        "JACKSON: [stage whisper] Shh. Just come here a second. I need you to get some stuff for me from Doose's.",
        "LORELAI: Jackson, what are you doing?",
        "JACKSON: [continues speaking quietly] Stop saying my name. Look, Sookie's got major food cravings, and I can't go in to \"Leech Headquarters\". They'll be all over me in two seconds flat.",
        "LORELAI: [sympathetic] Selectman job isn't getting any easier, huh?",
        "JACKSON: No, it's getting worse. Like last week -- Ann Benninghoff comes to me, right? She wants to put a sales cart outside the colonial museum selling revolutionary war books and \"just a few arrowheads.\" Fine, but then Sally Lannigan hears about that, and she wants to sell her pine-needle sachets out in front of the gazebo. Fine, but then Kirk comes to me in an outrage because he's allergic to all pine-scented things, and how could I not know this? And pretty soon, I'm nothing but an empty suit of Jackson skin.",
        "LORELAI: Ew. Well, what do you need?",
        "[Jackson pulls a rumpled piece of paper from his coat pocket and unfolds it.]",
        "JACKSON: Oh, thanks. Uh...let's see here. Grapefruit juice, Milk Duds, bloody mary mix, extra-spicy turkey sausage -- this is all going in the same blender, by the way -",
        "LORELAI: Good Lordy.",
        "JACKSON: Chives -- I'm getting a stomachache just reading this list.",
        "LORELAI: Give it to me. I'll brave headquarters for you.",
        "JACKSON: Thank you, thank you, thank you.",
        "[Lorelai pauses and smiles expectantly.]",
        "JACKSON: [ Sighs ] Do not go where you're going.",
        "LORELAI: Well, what's one leech versus a swarm?",
        "JACKSON: [looks to the skies and whimpers] I have no sanctuary.",
        "LORELAI: The pothole on the road to the Dragonfly is getting worse. Kids are starting to swim in it.",
        "JACKSON: I'll put it on the list, along with everything else.",
        "LORELAI: Top of the list, please? [louder] Jackson!",
        "JACKSON: Don't. Shh.",
        "LORELAI: [feigned innocence] Was that too loud? Can't always tell.",
        "JACKSON: It's on top of the list.",
        "LORELAI: [grins] Be back in a flash.",
        "[She exits into the store as another pedestrian walks by. Paranoid, Jackson quickly turns away, tries to look casual.]",
        "CUT TO SOOKIE AND JACKSON'S HOUSE - INTERIOR - FRONT DOOR",
        "[Jackson enters the house with Lorelai following, both laden with grocery bags.]",
        "JACKSON: Sookie, I'm home.",
        "LORELAI: I'm home, too!",
        "JACKSON: Were we followed? [peers around edge of curtain]",
        "LORELAI: I don't think so. Good thing we ditched that Audi in Marseilles. Now we just have to find that tracking device. [hears crying from next room] Sookie, honey, what's wrong?",
        "SOOKIE: [ Crying ] I just -- it's just -- it's just so sad.",
        "[Jackson and Lorelai join Sookie in the living room]",
        "LORELAI: Oh! People Magazine. Jackson, you know we don't allow soft human-interest stories around Sookie when she's pregnant.",
        "JACKSON: She must have snuck it in.",
        "SOOKIE: [whimpering] I feel like they were perfect for each other, you know?",
        "LORELAI: [sympathetic] Uh-huh. Who, honey?",
        "SOOKIE: [hiccupping stutters] The two of them. I mean, with the hair and the teeth and the -- you know?",
        "LORELAI: Who's got hair and teeth?",
        "SOOKIE: And then the Divine Brown thing happens, and bammo -- their love's in the toilet.",
        "LORELAI: We're talking Elizabeth Hurley and Hugh Grant?",
        "JACKSON: She must have found an old one somewhere.",
        "LORELAI: [encouragingly] That was years ago, Sookie.",
        "JACKSON: Tons of people have broken up since then.",
        "SOOKIE: [horrified] and Oh, my God!",
        "LORELAI: No, no, it's okay. Everyone's together and happy. Dispose, please.",
        "JACKSON: Gladly. [exits with the magazine]",
        "SOOKIE: Oh, is that my food?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, yes, look. We got, uh, turkey sausage -- extra-spicy like you wanted.",
        "SOOKIE: Yuk.",
        "LORELAI: And grapefruit juice.",
        "SOOKIE: Ugh.",
        "LORELAI: Rappini.",
        "SOOKIE: Ugh. Puke.",
        "LORELAI: You're not craving things anymore, are you?",
        "SOOKIE: I'm sorry.",
        "LORELAI: No.",
        "[Jackson returns to join his wife - sits on the arm of the sofa to comfort her]",
        "SOOKIE: Oh, I mean, I'm so friggin impossible. You're so good to me, and you go to all this trouble, and you get me everything I want, then I don't want it anymore. [Lorelai smiles warmly at her friend] I'm sorry that you have to be in love with a crazy person.",
        "JACKSON: Come here. [Sookie leans into his embrace] I'll tell you what -- I'll deal with as much moodiness and food weirdness as you can dish out as long as you do the actual \"squeezing a human being out of your body\" part.",
        "SOOKIE: [chuckles] Deal.",
        "[Jackson's gaze wanders out the front window. He stands suddenly, causing Sookie to grunt as she leans into nothing. ]",
        "JACKSON: Okay. That car just slowed down as it went past the house.",
        "LORELAI: Jackson, why don't you get away from the window and go relax or something?",
        "JACKSON: Oh, I shouldn't be near a window.",
        "SOOKIE: Why don't you take it easy, sweetie, and go check on Davey?",
        "JACKSON: All right, but if anyone calls for me, I'm not here... and I'm armed and dangerous. [exits again]",
        "LORELAI: [warm tone] He lo-o-o-ves you.",
        "SOOKIE: Then he's certifiable... because I'm certifiable, and you have to be certifiable to put up with that.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, you're pregnant. You're not supposed to be normal. [stands and walks to the kitchen to put away groceries]",
        "SOOKIE: [Chuckles] I guess so. And it may be mean, but when I worry too much about how I'm treating Jackson, I just remember Brandy.",
        "[Sookie stands and follows Lorelai to the kitchen and sits at the table]",
        "LORELAI: Brandy?",
        "SOOKIE: Christopher's Brandy.",
        "LORELAI: Christopher's Sherry?",
        "SOOKIE: Oh. [Chuckles] I knew it was something like that. Anyway, I'm handling this all better than her. How is he, anyway?",
        "LORELAI: Christopher? Fine. [pause] Wow, you know what? I have no idea. He never called me again.",
        "SOOKIE: Really?",
        "[Lorelai joins Sookie seated at the table]",
        "LORELAI: Not once since I went over there. I assume he's doing fine, but I don't know.",
        "SOOKIE: He never called? All those problems with the baby were solved in one night?",
        "LORELAI: Kind of weird, isn't it?",
        "SOOKIE: A little.",
        "LORELAI: You never know with him. He's as unpredictable as a pregnant woman. No offense.",
        "SOOKIE: [Chuckles] None taken.",
        "LORELAI: I hope he and G.G. are okay. The last time I was over there, he was duct-taping her diapers, but... I'm sure he's found the tabby thingies by now. Yeah, I'm sure he's okay.",
        "SOOKIE: Milk chocolate and artichoke hearts.",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "SOOKIE: That's what I want, and I'm not going to change my mind. Milk chocolate and... bell peppers! [excitedly hops to her feet]",
        "LORELAI: Ah.",
        "SOOKIE: Now I'm not going to change my mind. Jackson, I figured it out! Milk -- dark chocolate. Ooh, taffy! Taffy and walnuts. [Gasps] Taffy -- OOH, pistachios! Ooh, hearts of palm! [ she walks out of the room ]",
        "CUT TO RORY'S YALE DORM - COMMON ROOM",
        "[Rory seated on sofa, reading a newspaper. Paris paces nervously, then leans over Rory's shoulder]",
        "RORY: Paris, please don't compare our reading speeds again. You're fast, I'm slow. Enjoy your trophy.",
        "PARIS: I need the exact time of today's sunset.",
        "RORY: I'm in the middle of an article.",
        "PARIS: Well, if you read faster, you wouldn't be.",
        "[Rory turns the newspaper page]",
        "RORY: Okay, the time of today's sunset is 4:31.",
        "PARIS: Okay. Then I just have to keep my mind occupied until 4:31.",
        "RORY: Paris.",
        "PARIS: What?",
        "RORY: Tell me again why you're fasting for Ramadan.",
        "PARIS: Look, Rory, if you want to crib your articles from the A.P. Wire, that's your business. I, on the other hand, actually give a rat's ass about journalistic integrity. When I write about Ramadan, I experience Ramadan. Are you chewing gum?",
        "RORY: What? Yes. Why?",
        "PARIS: I'd really prefer it if you didn't chew it at me.",
        "RORY: Paris, did you know that not eating can make people kind of snippy?",
        "PARIS: Ramadan is about a lot more than just not eating. It calls for a total abstinence from food particles passing through the mouth or nose. Your bazooka is passing through my nose.",
        "[ Knock on door ]",
        "RORY: It's unlocked. [Marty walks in carrying a paper sack] Hey, Marty.",
        "MARTY: So, I just bartended this crazy brunch with chocolate fountains and floating ice sculptures, and I snagged us all kinds of hors d'oeuvres. [indicating the two bags he's carrying]",
        "PARIS: [sarcasm] Oh, nice going, bucko.",
        "MARTY: [eyes Paris timidly] Okay, so, she didn't really mean \"nice going,\" right? 'Cause there's sort of a devil-eye thing going on.",
        "RORY: She's fasting.",
        "PARIS: People came to America to escape religious persecution.",
        "[Cell phone rings - Rory stands and retrieves her cell phone. Marty takes her vacant seat on the sofa.]",
        "MARTY: Well, what religion is anti-leftovers? [eyes Paris warily]",
        "RORY: Hello.",
        "LORELAI: Hi. Guess where I am?",
        "RORY: Mom.",
        "LORELAI: Go on, guess.",
        "RORY: Oh, I don't know, Luke's?",
        "CUT TO STARS HOLLOW - LUKE'S DINER",
        "[Lorelai is standing behind Luke's counter as employees bustle around her.]",
        "LORELAI: But not just at Luke's -- on the phone at Luke's, and it's all perfectly legal because I'm on the diner's phone.",
        "RORY: A loophole. Nice.",
        "LORELAI: You got to love a loophole.",
        "[The scene switches between the diner and Rory's dorm]",
        "RORY: Getting to use Luke's behind-the-counter phone, that's like getting to wear his letterman jacket.",
        "LORELAI: I know. Maybe now he'll ask me to the sock hop.",
        "RORY: I'm glad you guys are all loopholey and sock-hoppy. It's nice.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah. Well, um, I just called to, you know, uh, brag about my loophole and check on plans for Friday night dinner.",
        "[Luke emerges from the back storeroom carrying supplies and shouts. ]",
        "LUKE: Hey!",
        "LORELAI: Hon, hold on a sec.",
        "[Luke walks up]",
        "LUKE: What are you doing back here?",
        "RORY: You didn't have permission to be behind the counter, did you?",
        "LORELAI: You don't need permission if you're the girlfriend.",
        "LUKE: [lectures] A sack of potatoes falls on your head, the insurance company doesn't care if you're the girlfriend.",
        "LORELAI: Well, you're storing potatoes in a very weird place if you're worried about them falling on people's heads.",
        "LUKE: [scolds and shoo's] Go. Go. Get.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, I'm getting.",
        "[She pulls the phone cord with her while walking around to the front of the counter returning to her stool. A semi-eaten bowl of pie and ice cream sits before her.]",
        "RORY: He's kicking you out?",
        "LORELAI: No. It's just my boyfriend's so protective of my safety, the thought of food falling on my head makes him crazy. So, anyway, what's better for you -- carpool or meet there?",
        "RORY: Meet's better, I guess.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, honey, I'll see you there.",
        "RORY: Oh, wait -- there's something I want to run by you.",
        "[At the dorm, Marty peeks inside one of his paper bags. Paris alternately fans the air and hits Marty with the newspaper]",
        "MARTY: Can't you just plug your nose or something?",
        "PARIS: Sure, ask a billion Muslims to plug their noses. That makes a lot of sense, Marty.",
        "[She continues to beat him with the paper until he closes the bag and leans back, defeated. Rory exits to her room.]",
        "CUT TO RORY'S DORM - BEDROOM",
        "[Rory enters and closes the door to avoid the noisy ruckus between Paris and Marty. Scene continues to switch between bedroom to Luke's Diner]",
        "RORY: Okay, so, I've got an idea.",
        "LORELAI: Finally this Yale thing's kicking in.",
        "RORY: I am sick of humoring Grandma and Grandpa during this stupid separation of theirs. This \"drinks here, dinner there\" is dumb. It's not working, and we should not do it anymore.",
        "LORELAI: Well, if you feel it is best to end the Friday night dinners, then as your mother, I feel it is my duty to support you.",
        "RORY: I'm not saying we should end Friday night dinners.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, well, then, as your mother, I feel it is my duty to tell you you're wrong.",
        "RORY: We need to take a stand. No more humoring. We need to get them in a room and talk some sense into them, and to do that, I think we should divide and conquer. So this Friday, I'll have dinner with one, and you'll have dinner with the other.",
        "LORELAI: Uh-huh. Hey, what happened to the idea of ending Friday night dinners? - Because I thought that one had real potential.",
        "[Loud muffled voices continue from the other room]",
        "RORY: This way, we can each talk to them one-on-one, break them down, convince them that their separation isn't okay with us.",
        "LORELAI: It's not?",
        "RORY: Mom, I know they both want to be with each other.",
        "LORELAI: Hon, my parents are very stubborn. I don't want you to get your hopes up about the outcome.",
        "RORY: But I can't stand it the way it is. I think they both miss each other, but they're just too proud, and it's just -- it's kind of breaking my heart.",
        "LORELAI: So...which one do you want me to take?",
        "RORY: How about I'll take grandpa, and you'll take grandma?",
        "LORELAI: Ahh, no!",
        "RORY: Okay, then I'll take grandma, and you take grandpa.",
        "LORELAI: Ahh, no!",
        "RORY: Mom.",
        "LORELAI: Can't I take the butler? He doesn't talk much, and as far as I can tell, thoroughly enjoys the way I dress.",
        "[Marty enters Rory's room and closes door behind him]",
        "MARTY: She's throwing things at me. Religious sanctuary, please.",
        "RORY: [to her mother] The butler is not an option.",
        "LORELAI: Fine, I'll take her.",
        "RORY: Thank you. Bye. [clicks off phone. Marty joins her on the edge of the bed. He hands her a paper bag.] Ooh. What's the bacon wrapped around?",
        "MARTY: Something bacon should never be wrapped around.",
        "RORY: Rich people.",
        "MARTY: They live very different lives.",
        "CUT TO LUKE'S DINER",
        "[Lorelai still sits at the counter. Luke walks up from the other side and clears away Lorelai's bowl and hands it to passing employee. He pulls out his usual tablet and pencil. He talks while he checks numbers.]",
        "LORELAI: Thanks.",
        "LUKE: So, that was Rory?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah.",
        "LUKE: How's she doing?",
        "LORELAI: Fine.",
        "LUKE: With the Dean thing and all, the breakup?",
        "LORELAI: She sounds okay. Actually, she's petite, but she's strong.",
        "LUKE: Good. I'm glad.",
        "LORELAI: Don't gloat.",
        "LUKE: I'm not gloating.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, you are.",
        "LUKE: I just said I'm glad she's okay. That's not gloating.",
        "LORELAI: It was your tone, like you were covering up for being gloaty by sounding extra non-gloaty.",
        "LUKE: Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: You always hated him. I get it.",
        "LUKE: I never hated him. I just never thought he was right for Rory, and I swear, I'm not gloating.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I don't know. If it walks like a gloat and quacks like a gloat --",
        "LUKE: I wasn't.",
        "LORELAI: I got to go. Kiss. [leans forward and Luke meets her half-way over the counter. They kiss]",
        "[T.J. enters the diner and walks up. He has a towel thrown over one shoulder.]",
        "T.J.: I stink. There's your headline. Keep your distance.",
        "LUKE: [to Lorelai] You better run.",
        "LORELAI: I'll call you later. [gathers her jacket and purse and stands]",
        "LUKE: If I don't strangle myself with the phone cord, I'll answer. [returns to his paperwork]",
        "LORELAI: Hi, T.J.",
        "T.J.: Three feet, Lorelai, 'cause I haven't showered in as many days.",
        "LORELAI: Uh-oh. Goodbye, T.J. [scoots around him carefully and exits]",
        "T.J.: [to Luke] I need your shower, buddy.",
        "[Luke doesn't look up]",
        "LUKE: Sorry. Broken.",
        "T.J.: Really? 'Cause you're looking powder fresh.",
        "LUKE: I am not powder fresh.",
        "T.J.: Come on, Luke, we got no water at our new place, and the flies, they are a-buzzing. [waves his hand] Man!",
        "LUKE: Fine, use my shower, T.J. [points to the direction of the stairs]",
        "T.J.: You're the best, you know that? I worship you.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, you should build an altar to me. You know, I know I shouldn't ask you this, but why isn't your water turned on?",
        "T.J.: 'Cause the pipes got trashed after I demo'd the upstairs bathroom.",
        "LUKE: You weren't going to demo the bathrooms.",
        "T.J.: But I had a little accident installing the towel rack, and the next thing you know, the whole bathroom's demo'd.",
        "LUKE: Because of the towel rack?",
        "T.J.: I got very angry at this towel rack.",
        "LUKE: Yes, that's very normal.",
        "T.J.: But I got some replacement pipe. I just got to cut it up into shorter pieces and stick it together, and we're good to go.",
        "LUKE: Okay, sounds like you know what you're doing.",
        "T.J.: I just need some kind of tool that cuts pipe. What would you call that?",
        "LUKE: [sarcastic] I don't know, a pipe cutter?",
        "T.J.: That's it! A pipe cutter! You know anyone who's got a pipe cutter?",
        "LUKE: I have a pipe cutter. Would you like to borrow it?",
        "T.J.: That cuts pipe, right?",
        "LUKE: Hey, T.J., Why don't you just hire a professional?",
        "T.J.: Because I'm trying to be responsible. What with the move and being in escrow and everything, I'm not exactly flush, so I figured I'd do it myself. [uses the \"pity me\" face] Is that so - wrong?",
        "LUKE: [fatalistic] I'll help you cut the pipe, T.J.",
        "T.J.: [mood immediately brightens] Oh, hey, that's beyond the call. You've got to be the best brother-in-law in the world.",
        "LUKE: Uh-huh. Thanks. Anything else?",
        "T.J.: You know, it's real hell trying to make coffee without water.",
        "LUKE: Have some coffee, T.J.",
        "[T.J. helps himself to a donut under the serving lid]",
        "T.J.: And a cruller to cut the bitterness 'cause sometimes -- no offense -- I find your coffee a little bitter. I mean, it's good. It's just a little bitter.",
        "CUT TO DRAGONFLY INN - FRONT DESK",
        "[Lorelai is typing on the computer. Michel walks up as a guest departs.]",
        "MICHEL: We need to talk.",
        "LORELAI: Shoot.",
        "MICHEL: There's a couple here I thought I recognized, but I was not sure, so I consulted an old guest ledger from the Independence Inn and found a physical description that confirmed their identities.",
        "LORELAI: Physical description?",
        "MICHEL: Yes. I had described them with astonishing accuracy, down to the crooked eyes and unsightly moles.",
        "LORELAI: You have a system of describing what people's moles look like?",
        "MICHEL: Mm-hmm. Moles, freckles. What is their weight? Are they buxom? Is their chin cleft? Do they walk with any sort of limp? But this is beside the point. You remember the bathrobe bandits?",
        "LORELAI: [feigns a gasps then returns deadpan] No.",
        "MICHEL: The married couple from Massachusetts that stole bathrobes from the Independence Inn every time they came. We call them the bathrobe bandits. They are here.",
        "LORELAI: Did they bring their moles?",
        "MICHEL: With your permission, I'm going to remove their bathrobes from their room as a preventative measure.",
        "LORELAI: No, no, Michel, come on. If they steal robes, we just charge their credit card.",
        "MICHEL: And if they take a credenza or a couch -- do you think they'll stop at robes?",
