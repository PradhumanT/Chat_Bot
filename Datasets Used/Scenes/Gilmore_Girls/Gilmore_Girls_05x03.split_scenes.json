    "Recap": [
        "Luke and Lorelai go on their official first date at a restaurant owned by old friends of Luke's parents. Luke reminds Lorelai of how they met, shows her a horoscope she gave him for good luck that he's kept in his wallet, and assures her that he intends to go the distance with her. Lorelai spends the night at Luke's place; in the morning, she goes down to the diner to get coffee, and the breakfast crowd sees her wearing only Luke's shirt. There's surprisingly little gossip about Luke and Lorelai until the next town meeting, where Taylor uses charts to show how disastrous a breakup between them would be for Stars Hollow. Meanwhile: Rory meets a rich Yale student named Logan and chews him out for being rude to her friend Marty; Paris holds a wake for Asher that all the guests assume is a keg party with a weird theme; and Emily freaks out when she discovers that Richard has a social life she doesn't know about, so she invades Rory's dorm during the wake."

        "[View of glass French windows and doors reveals an elegant interior. The nearby swimming pool casts a shimmering light on the building's exterior.]",

        "CUT TO POOLHOUSE INTERIOR",
        "[Lorelai and Rory sit on a plush loveseat, Richard on a padded club chair while a male servant mixes drinks at a nearby bar table.]",
        "RICHARD: His name is Robert.",
        "LORELAI: I thought every butler's name was Jeeves.",
        "RICHARD: He's not a butler. He's a valet.",
        "LORELAI: So he parks your car?",
        "RICHARD: No, he does not park my car. He does exactly what you see him doing.",
        "LORELAI: So he is a bartender.",
        "RICHARD: He attends to my needs.",
        "LORELAI: So he's a geisha.",
        "RICHARD: You'll be quieter once you have a drink, I assume. [to Rory] So, young lady, you're starting your second year of Yale this week.",
        "RORY: Yeah, I move into Branford on Monday.",
        "RICHARD: You're going to love Branford College. That where I lived, you know.",
        "RORY: I know.",
        "RICHARD: It is the oldest of Yale's residential colleges. They have these Carillon bells that are enchanting, and it has, what was called by Robert Frost, the most beautiful college courtyard in America.",
        "[Robert serves drinks]",
        "RORY: Well, I'll tell you what, Grandpa -- I'll get settled in, and then we can have lunch there.",
        "RICHARD: Ah, that's a deal.",
        "ROBERT: You wanted me to remind you that you were going to bring out the Hungarian cheese, sir.",
        "RICHARD: Yes I did. I'll be right back. [he stands and exits]",
        "RORY: This is crazy.",
        "LORELAI: Well, it depends on your definition of \"crazy.\" I, for one, found the Mariah Carey phone messages to her fans just refreshingly imaginative.",
        "RORY: We're having drinks in the pool house.",
        "LORELAI: Yup.",
        "RORY: The last time I was in the pool house was the last time I was in the pool.",
        "LORELAI: I know. I pushed you in.",
        "RORY: So, Grandpa's actually living out here?",
        "[they watch him as he prepares a small tray]",
        "LORELAI: Looks like.",
        "RORY: Do you think he's happy?",
        "LORELAI: I do. I think he's very happy out here with his books and his special friend, Robert.",
        "RORY: Don't be gross.",
        "LORELAI: What? I'm just saying two grown men out here alone with Hungarian cheese and swim trunks...",
        "RORY: Oh, jeez.",
        "LORELAI: Don't be so puritanical. After all, Heather has two mommies.",
        "RICHARD: All right, we have cheese, we have drinks. Do you each have a coaster?",
        "LORELAI: [holds up philosopher pictured coaster] Kierkegaard.",
        "RORY: [holds up] Schopenhauer.",
        "RICHARD: Excellent.",

        "MADONNA LOUISE: But the madam is ready now.",
        "RICHARD: Well, ladies, it's been a lovely evening. Until next week...",
        "LORELAI: Hold on, Dad. [gulps her martini]",
        "RORY: Thank you, Grandpa.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah. Thanks for the cheese, Dad. Bye.",

        "EMILY: I have the air-conditioning on, Lorelai.",
        "RORY: I like it, Grandma.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, my God, the sucking up.",
        "EMILY: Stop it. [then to Rory] Thank you. It's fennel potato puree with a touch of chili to give it spice. I thought we could go more exotic now that it's just us girls.",
        "LORELAI: If you really want an exotic girls' night out, Mom, let's hit Baja.",
        "EMILY: So, Rory, tell me, what's new?",
        "LORELAI: Different room, same reaction.",
        "RORY: Oh, nothing much.",
        "EMILY: Really? Well, what was new 20 minutes ago?",
        "RORY: Excuse me?",
        "EMILY: What did you talk about with your grandfather?",
        "RORY: Oh, well --",
        "EMILY: I mean, just because he gets you first in the evening doesn't mean you get to waste all the good stories on him.",
        "RORY: I didn't wa --",
        "EMILY: So, you just tell me everything you told him exactly as you told him, leave nothing out.",
        "RORY: Okay. Well, I'm moving into Branford College on Monday.",
        "EMILY: You know, Robert Frost said that Branford has the most beautiful college courtyard in America.",
        "LORELAI: Hmm. You don't say.",
        "EMILY: You knew that?",
        "RORY: No.",
        "EMILY: He told you that?",
        "LORELAI: No.",
        "EMILY: You've already discussed everything there is to discuss. You're all talked out.",
        "LORELAI: We're not all talked out.",
        "EMILY: He gets you first, talks you out, and I get two exhausted, empty shells. [notices Richard tip-toeing through the room] What do you think you're doing?",
        "RICHARD: I needed to get something out of my study.",
        "EMILY: [stands and walks over to him] You are supposed to stay in the pool house. That is what we agreed on.",
        "RICHARD: I am in the pool house.",
        "EMILY: Oh, really? Right now?",
        "RICHARD: No, not right now. I told you I had to get something.",
        "EMILY: Well, you should have called, made an appointment.",
        "RICHARD: To go into my own study?",
        "EMILY: You don't live here anymore, Richard. What if I was sitting in the living room stark-naked? [Both sad, Rory and Lorelai exchange looks.]",
        "RICHARD: You've never been in the living room stark-naked. You've never been stark-naked. We went skinny-dipping one night, and you wore an overcoat.",
        "EMILY: The water was freezing! [she follows Richard as he exits]",
        "RORY: Crazy.",
        "LORELAI: You said it, Patsy Cline.",
        "CUT TO LUKE'S DINER",
        "[Lorelai and Rory enter the diner deep in conversation]",
        "LORELAI: Okay, but think about it. Why do we need the word \"potty\"? Is it really that much harder for a kid to learn the word \"bathroom\"?",
        "RORY: I don't know. [they sit at a table]",
        "LORELAI: \"Timmy, do you have to go potty?\" Or \"Timmy, do you have to go to the bathroom?\" See? Interchangeable.",
        "RORY: Not exactly interchangeable.",
        "LORELAI: How are they not interchangeable?",
        "RORY: To go potty is an action. To go to the bathroom is to go into a specific place.",
        "LORELAI: I hate the word \"potty.\"",
        "RORY: Well, what did you teach me to say?",
        "LORELAI: \"Bathroom.\"",
        "RORY: You did?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, of course.",
        "RORY: I'm 2, I come up to you and I say, \"Mommy, Mommy, I have to go to the -\" --",

        "LUKE: I'm working.",
        "LORELAI: Come on. This is the beginning of a relationship. You're supposed to act stupid.",
        "LUKE: I'll do the chicken dance on my lunch break. [to Rory] Heading back to school?",
        "RORY: Yeah, sophomore year.",
        "LUKE: Anything you want - on the house.",
        "LORELAI: [too bright smile] I can't believe you won't flirt with me in front of my daughter. She's gonna think there's something wrong with me.",
        "RORY: Please. I got that confirmation letter a long time ago. Scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese and half bacon, half sausage.",
        "LORELAI: I'll have the same, and put it on her tab.",
        "LUKE: You get your own tab.",
        "LORELAI: [dryly] Oh, thank God you don't have a Latin accent, or you'd be completely irresistible.",
        "LUKE: Coffee will be ready in a minute. [backs away while subtlety signaling Lorelai with his head.]",
        "LORELAI: Be back in a second. [She walks over to the counter. Luke stands behind the counter writing in his ledger book.]",
        "LORELAI: [ Clears throat ] You gestured?",
        "LUKE: [continues to look down while speaking quietly] Those jeans are really working for you.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah?",
        "LUKE: They're working for me, too.",
        "LORELAI: You're flirting with me.",
        "LUKE: Something like that.",
        "LORELAI: Finally. Do it some more.",
        "LUKE: Your shoes work well with that - shirt. [briefly glances up]",
        "LORELAI: Gee, Carson, thanks.",
        "LUKE: That's all I can do right now. People are watching.",
        "LORELAI: Okay.",
        "LUKE: [meaningfully raises his eyes] But tonight I will give you my extremely positive views on other aspects of your being.",
        "LORELAI: Tonight?",
        "LUKE: Are you free?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, I'm free.",
        "LUKE: Good. 7:30.",
        "LORELAI: What are we gonna do?",
        "LUKE: I've got some thoughts.",
        "LORELAI: Alright, but no taking me to an art museum after hours and then to an empty Hollywood bowl where you give me a pair of diamond earrings that you bought with your college money when all the time you're really in love with your best friend, the drummer, who's posing as our driver for the evening.",
        "LUKE: [pause] Okay, I'll think of something else.",
        "LORELAI: So, what do we say?",
        "LUKE: Say?",
        "LORELAI: To people, to the town. Do we tell them we're dating?",
        "LUKE: I don't know. Do we?",
        "LORELAI: I don't know. I guess we could keep it quiet for a while.",
        "LUKE: We could -- if that's what you want.",
        "LORELAI: No, that's not what I want.",
        "LUKE: Why don't we just play it by ear?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, yeah. People will know when they know.",
        "LUKE: Okay, sounds good.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, so, 7:30?",
        "LUKE: 7:30",
        "LORELAI: Are you gonna watch me walk away?",
        "LUKE: Yeah.",
        "LORELAI: I'll add a little jaunt to it for you.",
        "[she struts back to Rory and glances back before she sits]",
        "RORY: What was that all about?",
        "LORELAI: We were just talking about our date for tonight.",

        "LORELAI: Me too. Hey, have you talked to --",
        "RORY: No.",
        "LORELAI: Do you think you're going to before you - [Rory shakes her head no to end the topic as Luke walks up.] Oh, food. Thank God.",
        "LUKE: Hot plates.",
        "LORELAI: See? He called me \"Hot Plates.\" He so likes me.",

        "EMILY: The mail must be here. [Door bell rings] The Farthingtons' dogs are apoplectic. Ridiculous choice of animal -- a vicious 3-inch ball of hair and a bow -- a ridiculous pink bow for the vicious killers. \"Oh, watch out! Cecil Beaton and the Duke of Windsor are headed straight for my shoes!\" [maid enters with a handful of mail] Thank you. I'd like some coffee when you get a chance. [the maid nods and exits.

        "MARTY: I'm living here.",

        "MARTY: Nice room.",
        "[Movers set sofa down and exit]",
        "RORY: I can't believe I beat Paris here. I mean, normally, she would want to get dibs on the best room first and set up the furniture exactly the way she wants it.",
        "MARTY: Maybe she's just late.",

        "PARIS: No, Rory. This great man was not brought down by my v*g1n*, okay?",
        "RORY: Okay. Sorry. I just -- that's terrible.",
        "PARIS: He was teaching a Shakespeare class -- \"A Midsummer Night's Dream.\" He was doing Puck, and then suddenly he wasn't.",
        "RORY: Oh, man.",
        "PARIS: And the class was so into his reading, they didn't even get it. They thought he was acting. It was Dick Shawn all over again.",
        "RORY: Where are you?",
        "PARIS: I'm in his flat trying to get his effects squared away, and, of course, his family is acting like spoiled children. All they care about is what they get. If I have to moderate one more argument about the Chippendale desk, I'm going to freak out. And the lawyer handling his affairs is a moron, and don't even get me started on the funeral. He wanted to be cremated, but if you had seen how filthy that crematorium was -- so I shipped him to Cambridge, which apparently is known for its cremation facilities. That was a transportation nightmare, and, of course, his daughter was upset with the move, but where was she at Thanksgiving, huh?",
        "RORY: Is there anything I can do to help?",
        "PARIS: No. Thanks. [long pause] I'm sad.",

        "RICHARD: I will stop payment on the check and issue another one.",
        "EMILY: Fine. There's the issue of the Gregorys' cocktail party on the fourth. Even though they did miss our Christmas party last year, you are currently involved in a business deal with Hamilton, so one of us should probably attend.",
