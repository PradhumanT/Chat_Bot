        "[The doorbell rings, the maid answers it; Lorelai and Rory are standing there.]",
        "MAID: Yes?",
        "LORELAI: Hey.",
        "MAID: Hello.",
        "LORELAI: You're new.",
        "MAID: Uh, I started yesterday.",
        "LORELAI: What's your name?",
        "MAID: Liesl.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, Liesl. I'm Brigitta, this is Gretl. And, uh, Emily and Richard are expecting us.",
        "LIESL: Oh, I'm sorry. Please come in.",
        "[Lorelai and Rory walk inside; they hear Emily and Richard arguing upstairs.]",
        "LIESL: Uh, can I, uh, get you a drink?",
        "LORELAI: You know what, that's okay. I can get it. Why don't you go hide in the kitchen?",
        "LIESL: Really? Thank you. [walks away]",
        "RORY: What is going on?",
        "LORELAI: I don't know. I think George and Martha are joining us for dinner.",
        "[Lorelai and Rory watch Emily and Richard fighting on the steps.]",
        "RICHARD: I didn't know that my every conversation needed to be reported to you. I stand corrected.",
        "EMILY: I have been the co-chair of the Starlight Foundation for the last eight years.",
        "RICHARD: I know this, Emily.",
        "EMILY: And the Black and White Ball is the main fundraising event of the season.",
        "RICHARD: It's one year.",
        "EMILY: The co-chair cannot miss the main fundraising event.",
        "RICHARD: Why? Won't the chair be there?",
        "EMILY: Is this a joke to you?",
        "RICHARD: Emily, I have too many things to take care of at work. I don't have time for frivolous parties.",
        "EMILY: Frivolous parties? Friv. . . .[walks up the steps]",
        "RICHARD: Well, where are you going? Oh, come back here. [follows her]",
        "RORY: Wow, this is bad.",
        "LORELAI: I know, I wish we had popcorn.",
        "RORY: Mom.",
        "LORELAI: Shh. Incoming.",
        "[Emily and Richard come back down the steps. Emily reads from a stack of invitations.]",
        "EMILY: The Hartford Zoological Silent Auction, the Mark Twain House Restoration Fund luncheon, the Harriet Beecher Stowe Literacy Auction.",
        "RICHARD: I can read those myself, you know.",
        "EMILY: This is the fourth event you've taken upon yourself to turn down on our behalf. And I am on the board of all of those foundations. Now how do you think that makes me look?",
        "RICHARD: Like your husband is busy and has a great deal of responsibility.",
        "EMILY: Well, I have responsibilities too.",
        "RICHARD: I understand that your social engagements are important.",
        "EMILY: They're not just social engagements.",
        "RICHARD: Anything at which you serve tea is a social engagement.",
        "EMILY: That's it. I am gonna get a tape recorder so you can hear how pompous and condescending you sound.",
        "RICHARD: Wha...uh...Emily.",
        "EMILY: No, I wouldn't want you to take my word for it. I might be delirious from all that tea I've been drinking. [walks upstairs]",
        "RICHARD: Oh stop this. [follows her]",
        "RORY: Maybe we should leave.",
        "LORELAI: Are you kidding? We've got dinner theater here.",
        "RORY: But Grandma and Grandpa are obviously in a fight.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah?",
        "RORY: One that they probably wouldn't want us to see.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, we stumbled in here completely innocently. We came for dinner as usual, per their request. We had no idea we were walking into The Lion King without the puppet heads.",
        "[They come back downstairs. Emily follows Richard holding out a tape recorder.]",
        "RICHARD: Get that thing out of my face.",
        "EMILY: Just say the tea thing again.",
        "RICHARD: You are behaving like a child.",
        "EMILY: Turn around when you talk, would you? I'm not sure how good this microphone is.",
        "RICHARD: [sees Lorelai and Rory] Oh.",
        "EMILY: What?",
        "LORELAI: [claps] Brava! Encore! I'm sorry, does Terrence McNally know about you too? Get me the phone!",

        "RORY: It sucks. I know it sucks, just tell me it sucks.",
        "LORELAI: It's great.",
        "RORY: No it's not.",
        "LORELAI: It's an A.",
        "RORY: Don't lie.",
        "LORELAI: A-plus.",
        "RORY: You're my mom.",
        "LORELAI: Is anything higher than an A-plus?",
        "RORY: You have to say that.",
        "LORELAI: It's an A-plus with a crown and a wand.",
        "RORY: This is not how you raise a child. You don't send them out there with a false sense of pride because out there, in the real world, no one will coddle you. I'd rather know right now if I'm gonna be working at CNN or carrying a basket around it's offices with sandwiches in it.",
        "LORELAI: Rory.",
        "RORY: Yeah?",
        "LORELAI: It's great.",
        "RORY: Really?",
        "LORELAI: Really really.",
        "RORY: Thank you.",
        "[Luke walks over and fills their mugs.]",
        "LUKE: Coffee coffee. Okay, what do you want? Eggs, toast, combo?",
        "LORELAI: What's the rush there, Zippy?",
        "LUKE: I'm just swamped this morning. I was supposed to have help but I don't. So order right now or I'm bringing the both of you an egg white omelet with a side of steamed spinach.",
        "LORELAI: Pancakes.",
        "RORY: French toast.",
        "LUKE: Thank you. [Jess walks into the diner from the stairway] Jess, you were supposed to be down here. . . .what the hell is that?",
        "JESS: What?",
        "LUKE: That.",
        "JESS: That is a shirt.",
        "LUKE: Change.",
        "JESS: What?",
        "LUKE: Go upstairs and change your shirt.",
        "JESS: I like this shirt.",
        "LUKE: How can you like that shirt?",
        "JESS: It brings out my eyes.",
        "LUKE: Hey, part of the deal of you staying here is that you work here, and when you work here you will wear proper work attire, and that is not proper work attire. Now go upstairs and change into something that won't scare the hell out of my customers.",
        "JESS: Whatever you say Uncle Luke. [goes upstairs]",
        "LORELAI: Gross shirt.",
        "RORY: Yeah.",

        "MAID: Mm hmm. [walks away]",
        "LADY 1: Another new one, Emily?",
        "EMILY: Yes. The last one only made it through one evening. Thoroughly nervous creature.",
        "LADY 2: What do you do to them, Em?",
        "EMILY: Oh, the usual. Clean this, cook that, sacrifice a virgin on your way out.",
        "LADY 1: [laughs] The things you say.",
        "LADY 2: We could've done with some of that at the ball the other night.",
        "EMILY: Why, was it dull?",
        "LADY 2: I felt as if my shoes were going out of style as I sat there.",
        "EMILY: What a shame.",
        "LADY 3: Now, Nattie, it wasn't all dull. Are we forgetting Truly Bishop?",
        "NATTIE: Oh, that's right.",
        "EMILY: What, what about Truly Bishop?",
        "LADY 3: Well, you know she and Eugene split up last month.",
        "EMILY: What?",
        "NATTIE: Oh Em! You knew about that. They had this huge fight at the. . oh that's right, you missed the Schafer's cocktail party.",
        "EMILY: They broke up at the Schafer's cocktail party?",
        "NATTIE: He has another family in Salisbury.",
        "EMILY: No!",
        "LADY 3: She's 26, with a 2 year old.",
        "EMILY: How did Truly find out?",
        "NATTIE: The little tart sent her a letter.",
        "EMILY: Oh my God.",
        "LADY 1: So Truly confronted Eugene after consuming a bottle and a half of Cristal, and he admitted it. He said he was going to leave her and marry the Salisbury concubine.",
        "EMILY: What did she do?",
        "LADY 1: She threw an ice sculpture at his head.",
        "EMILY: I can't believe I missed that.",
        "LADY 1: You've missed everything lately.",
        "LADY 3: Yes, where have you been? Is everything all right?",
        "EMILY: Yes, it's just, uh, Richard.",
        "NATTIE: He hasn't been hanging out in Salisbury, has he?",
        "EMILY: No, he's been swamped at work. Night and day, weekends. You'd think he was the only person who worked at that company. Plus, he hasn't been feeling very well. His back and knees. Very bad knees. [Sees Rory at the patio doorway] Oh Rory, what a nice surprise.",
        "RORY: Hey Grandma. Sorry to butt in like this.",
        "EMILY: Nonsense, come and meet my friends. Ladies, I'd like you to meet my granddaughter Rory.",
        "LADY 3: Well, hello Rory.",
        "RORY: Nice to meet you.",
        "NATTIE: My goodness, what a pretty girl you are.",
        "LADY 1: She looks just like Lorelai, doesn't she?",
        "NATTIE: The eyes.",
        "LADY 3: The nose.",
        "LADY 1: Walk around sweetie.",
        "EMILY: Sally, leave the girl alone.",
        "LADY 1: I just wanna see the walk. Lorelai had such a specific walk.",
        "LADY 3: Fast.",
        "LADY 1: That was it.",
        "EMILY: Come, sit, would you like some tea?",
        "RORY: Oh, no. I just came to pick up a book that Grandpa was supposed to leave for me.",
        "EMILY: Go check his study. It might be on his desk.",
        "RORY: Okay, thanks. [walks inside]",
        "LADY 3: Emily, your granddaughter is just lovely. How old is she?",
        "EMILY: Sixteen.",
        "LADY 3: Sixteen, that's a nice age.",
        "LADY 1: So, have you thought about her debut?",
        "EMILY: Oh, uh, no, not yet.",
        "LADY 3: Well you know, the Daughters of the Daughters of the American Revolution Debutante Ball is next week.",
        "EMILY: It is? I hadn't realized.",
        "LADY 3: Why don't you present Rory there?",
        "EMILY: Oh. . uh. . Well, I don't know. Isn't it a little late?",
        "LADY 1: Oh please. For Emily Gilmore, I'm sure they'll bend the rules.",
        "LADY 3: Oh you have to. With a girl like that Emily, you'll be the hit of the ball.",
        "NATTIE: She'd definitely be the prettiest one there.",
        "LADY 1: Except for Katie Heathington.",
        "LADY 3: No, didn't you hear? Katie fell off her horse, has a scab on her face.",
        "NATTIE: Oh, well then, if Katie Heathington has a scab on her face, Rory will definitely be the prettiest one there.",
        "LADY 3: It'll be your crowning moment.",
        "[Rory returns with the book]",
        "RORY: I found it. [pause] Yay.",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S KITCHEN",
        "[Lorelai sits at the kitchen table doing homework as Rory comes home.]",
        "RORY: I'm coming out.",
        "LORELAI: Out of what?",
        "RORY: Out into society.",
        "LORELAI: What are you talking about?",
        "RORY: I went to Grandma's house after school.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, right away, bad.",
        "RORY: And, um, her DAR friends are all there and they're talking about this debutante ball that's being thrown.",
        "LORELAI: Oh no.",
        "RORY: And when I got back from Grandpa's office, they all invited me out onto the patio.",
        "LORELAI: No no no, please tell me you did not go out onto the patio.",
        "RORY: I went out onto the patio.",
        "LORELAI: Ugh, Rory, that's like accepting the position as the drummer in Spinal Tap.",
        "RORY: Before I knew it, Grandma was telling me how important it is for a person to be properly presented to society.",
        "LORELAI: Ugh.",
        "RORY: And how every young girl dreams of this day.",
        "LORELAI: Agh.",
        "RORY: And how there are flowers.",
        "LORELAI: Oh Lord.",
        "RORY: And music.",
        "LORELAI: Please.",
        "RORY: And cake.",
        "LORELAI: Oh yeah, the cake's actually good.",
        "RORY: And before I knew it, Grandma was bringing out your old dress and I was trying it on and. . . what are you doing?",
        "LORELAI: I'm getting you out of this. [picks up phone]",
        "RORY: Mom, wait.",
        "LORELAI: I swear, there is nothing in the world my mother is better at than getting someone to agree to something that in any other universe, they would never ever consider.",
        "RORY: Mom.",
        "LORELAI: I am still convinced she had something to do with Lily Tomlin doing that movie with John Travolta.",
        "RORY: I'm doing this.",
        "LORELAI: Why?",
        "RORY: Because you should've seen the look on Grandma's face when she asked me. It's just really really important to her.",
        "LORELAI: But. . .",
        "RORY: Now if it's that important to her, and it's not that important to me, then why shouldn't I do it?",
        "LORELAI: Rory, do you now what a coming out party says?",
        "RORY: It says I'm a woman now.",
        "LORELAI: No. It says, 'Hi, I'm Rory. I'm of good breeding and marriageable age, and I will now parade around in front of young men of similarly good breeding and marriageable age so they can all take a good long look at me.'",
        "RORY: You're exaggerating.",
        "LORELAI: No, it's like animals being up for bid at the county fair, except sheep don't wear hoop skirts.",
        "RORY: Look, I promised, but you don't have to be apart of it if you don't want to.",
        "LORELAI: No, no, if you wanna do it, I'll help. It's just weird. This is all the stuff I ran away from. I just assumed you'd be running with me.",
        "RORY: Well, I would, but I heard debutantes don't run. Something about the heels.",
        "LORELAI: All right then. If you're sure, where do we start? Uh, let's see. Well, you have a dress. You need a dowry, I guess. There you go. And uh, you'll need shoes, hose, gloves, some mice, a dog, a pumpkin. What's wrong?",
        "RORY: Oh, nothing.",
        "LORELAI: Rory.",
        "RORY: Oh, no, it just says that your father is supposed to present you at the ceremony.",
        "LORELAI: Oh.",
        "RORY: Whatever, it's no big deal. I can get someone else to do it. Grandpa probably.",
        "LORELAI: Rory.",
        "RORY: Or Taylor.",
        "LORELAI: Okay.",
        "RORY: Or the cable guy looked pretty friendly last week. Maybe he has a tux.",
        "LORELAI: Hand me the phone.",
        "RORY: I was kidding about the cable guy. What are you doing?",
        "LORELAI: [dials phone] Look missy, there are plenty of things that should weird you out about coming out, but inviting your father shouldn't be one of them.",
        "OPERATOR: The number you have dialed. . .",
        "LORELAI: Umm, wra. . . gum wrapper.",
        "RORY: He's not going to come.",
        "LORELAI: You don't know until you ask.",
        "RORY: Mom.",
        "LORELAI: [dials new number] Look, we call, we ask, there's no harm. Trust me. Cable guy's not going anywhere.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Hello?",
        "LORELAI: Ugh, hi. Where the hell are you?",
        "CHRISTOPER: Boston.",
        "LORELAI: Boston? [walks into living room]",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, Boston. Baked Beans, cream pie, tea party, strangler.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, that Boston.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: And you?",
        "LORELAI: Me.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Where are you?",
        "LORELAI: Helsinki.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Really.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, I finally got the girl band together and after a week opening stateside, we headed across the Atlantic and now we're huge with the Nordic set.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: It's good to hear from you. We haven't talked in awhile.",
        "LORELAI: You could've called too, you know. Or do you have one of those special phones that only receives calls?",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Well, I figured you had a lot going on what with the engagement and the canceling of the engagement. How's that going, by the way?",
        "LORELAI: No, still canceled.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: You okay?",
        "LORELAI: Good. And I'm even better when I'm not talking about it.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Moving on then.",
        "LORELAI: So I have some shocking news. Rory's coming out.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Out of what?",
        "LORELAI: Coming out. White dresses, gloves, curtsies.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Stop it.",
        "LORELAI: I swear to God.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: I can't believe you're letting her do it.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, well, I wasn't about to let her use my method of getting out of it.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: This is crazy.",
        "LORELAI: She's doing it as a favor to my mom, there's no talking her out of it.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Well, did you tell her about Barbara Hutton, Doris Duke, Gloria Vanderbilt?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, and she's perfectly willing to marry Cary Grant, get offed by her crazy butler and start designing blue jeans as soon as the ball ends.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Well, okay, if that's what she wants.",
        "LORELAI: Now comes the reason for my phone call.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: All your regular 976 numbers are busy.",
        "LORELAI: Now I know this is totally not your thing, but as you will remember, part of the whole coming out process involves the girls being escorted around the dance floor by their Dads.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Ah.",
        "LORELAI: Now, I know you would rather sit through \"Endless Love\" than ever be apart of this scene again. But this is very important to your daughter and she has never asked you for anything, and although no one's keeping track, it would seem that your constant non-presence in her life and your lack of ever showing up when you say you're going to or calling when you say you're going to or basically doing anything when you say you're going to would tend to indicate that you owe her, big time. Now before you say no, I want you to take a minute and remember you have a great daughter who needs you and she has a mother who will hunt you down like a half-priced Kate Spade purse if you disappoint her.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Okay, I'm there.",
        "LORELAI: By there, do you mean the Daughters of the American Revolution Annual Debutante Ball?",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Yes.",
        "LORELAI: Oh Chris, please don't make this promise if you can't.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: I wouldn't miss it.",
        "LORELAI: It's next weekend.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: I'll clear my schedule.",
        "LORELAI: You swear?",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Oh wait, next weekend?",
        "LORELAI: Christopher!",
        "CHRISTOPHER: I'm kidding, I will definitely be there.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, and in exchange for that I will refrain from saying the ten things that came to mind for making fun of your schedule.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Thanks.",
        "LORELAI: Bye.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Bye.",
        "[Rory walks into living room]",
        "LORELAI: Hey Little Debbie, your dad is definitely gonna be there.",
        "RORY: You're kidding!",
        "LORELAI: No, he's gonna walk you down the stairs, and turn you in a circle, watch you curtsy, and announce that Rory Gilmore is officially open for business.",
        "RORY: I can't believe it. And he definitely said definitely?",
        "LORELAI: Definitely.",
        "RORY: So there's a fifty/fifty chance.",
        "LORELAI: I don't know. He sounded pretty sure, I'd say sixty/forty.",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "[Dean, Lane and Rory are on the couch watching TV while Lorelai walks around the living room talking on the telephone.]",
        "LORELAI: No Mom, I'm sure one crinolin will be plenty. No, she doesn't. I'm sure she doesn't. Yeah, in what scenario would I have bought Rory elbow length kidskin gloves, Mom? Oh, I'm sorry, I meant what scenario on my planet would I have bought Rory elbow length kidskin gloves?",
        "RORY: So?",
        "DEAN: So what?",
        "RORY: It's good huh?",
        "DEAN: It's the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction.",
        "RORY: And doesn't Neil Young look cool?",
        "DEAN: I guess.",
        "RORY: If you'll notice, he's wearing a tux.",
        "DEAN: Neil Young looks cool because he's Neil Young, not because he's wearing a tux.",
        "LORELAI: No, I don't have to ask her mom 'cause I know the answer. I know the answer Mom, I know the answer. Yeah, no, okay, well I don't have to ask her Mom Hold on. Rory, would you like Grandma's hairstylist to come and set your hair before the ball? . . Oh, I did not coach her Mom, go back to talking about gloves.",
        "RORY: I think you're gonna look great in a tux.",
        "LANE: Tails.",
        "DEAN: What?",
        "LANE: Yeah, according to this it says that all escorts must be properly attired in black tails, white cumberbuns, and white gloves.",
        "DEAN: What?",
        "RORY: I'm sure the gloves are optional.",

I myself came out in this very hall in nineteen well, let's just say, a number of years ago. Now the word debutante comes from the French word debuter, which means to lead off. . .[fades into background]",

        "EMILY: Well, that's too bad. We have a social responsibility Richard.",

        "EMILY: There are other accounts, Richard.",
        "RICHARD: I have been in charge of that account for ten years!",
        "EMILY: How can you be so angry? Yes, they took you off that account, but they also gave you a promotion.",
        "RICHARD: Oh, Emily.",
        "EMILY: You said they moved you upstairs to a larger office and gave you a new title and a better parking space.",

        "EMILY: You are not.",
        "RICHARD: What do you mean I'm not? I know whether I'm being phased out. I invented phased out for this company. Don't you think I did the exact same thing to Alan Parker?",
        "EMILY: Alan Parker retired.",
        "RICHARD: Alan Parker was phased out. I now have his office, I now have his parking space. Do you know what happens from here? I lose more accounts, slowly but surely. They will put a younger man on them with me to be trained by the best. And then, one day they'll call and ask me to let that young man take a meeting without me, just to see how fast he's learning, and then suddenly that young man is given that account. And this happens again and again and again until I'm nothing, but a symbolic figurehead that they roll out for banquets and group pictures. And then one day, Emily, I will be asked to leave.",

        "RICHARD: I don't want other options. I want to get up every morning and put on my suit, and go to my office, and do my work, like I've done everyday for the past thirty years. That's what I want to do. That's the only thing I want to do.",
