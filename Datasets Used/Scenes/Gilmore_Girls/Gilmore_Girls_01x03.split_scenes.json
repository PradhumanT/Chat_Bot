    "Recap": [
        "When Rory announces at Friday night dinner that she has to pick a team sport to play at Chilton, Emily insists that Richard take Rory to the club and teach her golf. Although Rory tees off to a rocky start, she soon gets into the swing of things and has a great time walking and talking with Richard. Later, Lorelai's mixed feelings as Rory tells her how much she enjoyed being with Richard at the club provokes her into an intensely stupid argument with Rory, which is soon patched up when Lorelai realizes that she's not losing Rory to her parents. At the Inn, Lorelai has her hands full overseeing all the preparations for an ornate double wedding ceremony and contending with a pair of spoiled and quarrelsome twin brides, their exhausted mother, their twin grooms, Michel, and the rest of her staff."

        "(The scene opens at the Gilmores' weekly dinner.)",
        "RICHARD: Dinner was lovely, Emily.",
        "EMILY: Mira does make a perfect cassoulet.",
        "LORELAI: Who's Mira?",
        "EMILY: Our cook.",
        "LORELAI: I thought the cook was Heidi.",
        "EMILY: Oh, no, we let Heidi go months ago. She had a problem closing things -- the door, the refrigerator --",
        "RICHARD: The liquor bottle.",
        "EMILY: Then it was Trina, then Sophia.",
        "RICHARD: Oh, I liked Sophia.",
        "EMILY: You did not.",
        "RICHARD: I didn't?",
        "EMILY: She was the one who sang.",
        "RICHARD: That's right -- terrible woman.",
        "EMILY: And after Sophia we had Anton.",
        "RICHARD: That's right. Anton was the one that I liked.",
        "LORELAI: I'm sorry, Dad, how do you mix up Anton and Sophia?",
        "RICHARD: What do you mean?",
        "LORELAI: Well, one is a man and one is a woman.",
        "RICHARD: And your point being?",
        "LORELAI: That one is a man and one is a woman.",
        "RICHARD: I have a lot to do in a day, Lorelai, I don't have time to keep up with a multitude of people that your mother employs.",
        "LORELAI: But one is a man and one is a woman.",
        "(The cook brings in a cake.)",
        "LORELAI: The dinner was so wonderful, Mira.",
        "SARAH: It's Sarah.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, I'm sorry.",
        "(Sarah leaves.)",
        "LORELAI: Mom! Her name is Sarah!",
        "EMILY: I thought she said Mira.",
        "LORELAI: Ugh!",
        "RORY: Hey, Grandma, these plates are really pretty.",
        "EMILY: Thank you, Rory. They were your great-grandmother's.",
        "RICHARD: Lorelai the first.",
        "RORY: I thought Mom was the first.",
        "EMILY: Not in the name.",
        "LORELAI: No, but in so many other things I was a regular trailblazer. Just finishing your thought, Mom.",
        "RICHARD: Lorelai the first was my mother. She was an extremely accomplished equestrian, a distinguished patron of the arts, and she was also world-famous for her masquerade balls. She was quite a woman, my mother.",
        "EMILY: Yes she was. Mira, come cut the cake please.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, and why don't you bring Sarah out here with you?",
        "EMILY: So, Lorelai, how are things at that charming little inn of yours?",
        "LORELAI: Mm -- they're still charming and little. We're just crossing our fingers it doesn't assert itself and become rude and large.",
        "RORY: Mom's having a huge wedding there this week.",
        "EMILY: Really?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, actually there's people coming from all over the country.",
        "EMILY: Well, isn't that nice?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah.",
        "EMILY: Rory, how's Chilton?",
        "LORELAI: OK, done with me now.",
        "EMILY: I'm sorry, was there more to the story?",
        "LORELAI: Uh, Rory has to pick a team sport to play.",
        "RORY: It's a requirement.",
        "RICHARD: Physical fitness is as important as intellectual fitness. So says Plato and so say I.",
        "EMILY: What sport are you going to pick?",
        "RORY: I'm not sure. I'm not really the athletic type.",
        "LORELAI: I told her she should go out for the debating team.",
        "RORY: It's not a sport.",
        "LORELAI: It is the way the Gilmores play.",
        "EMILY: So, what are your choices?",
        "RORY: God, there's like a thousand of them: basketball, lacrosse, swimming, track, golf --",
        "EMILY: Golf?",
        "RORY: Yeah.",
        "EMILY: Well your grandfather is a golf player.",
        "LORELAI: Oops.",
        "EMILY: He plays every week at the club. He could teach you to play like a pro.",
        "RICHARD: Emily.",
        "EMILY: Why, he could take you there on Sunday. It's perfect.",
        "RICHARD: It's not something you can teach in an afternoon.",
        "LORELAI: That's OK. Rory can pick something else.",
        "EMILY: Why should she pick something else? She needs to learn a sport and Richard can teach her a sport. (to Rory) You can use your mother's old golf clubs. They're upstairs gathering dust along with the rest of her potential.",
        "LORELAI: OK, Mom, can I maybe talk to you for a minute?",
        "EMILY: We're having dessert.",
        "LORELAI: I know but I'd like to talk to you fast before the sugar sets in and makes me crazy.",
        "EMILY: You are the oddest person.",
        "LORELAI: Too easy.",
        "(Lorelai and Emily get up from the table and go into another room to talk.)",
        "EMILY: What is so important it can't wait for cake?",
        "LORELAI: Keep moving.",
        "EMILY: This is as far as I can go unless you'd like me to bore my way through the wall.",
        "LORELAI: Don't do this, Mom.",
        "EMILY: Do what?",
        "LORELAI: Force Rory and Dad to go golfing.",
        "EMILY: I'm not forcing anybody.",
        "LORELAI: Well you're manipulating the situation in a way that gives no one a way out. That's force. Look it up.",
        "EMILY: I'm just trying to help your daughter get an education.",
        "LORELAI: Thank you. She'll find another sport.",
        "EMILY: Why should she?",
        "LORELAI: Because she doesn't want to go and Dad doesn't want to take her.",
        "EMILY: Oh, your father doesn't know what he wants. He'd get his hair cut at the butcher if I let him.",
        "LORELAI: Let it go please.",
        "EMILY: Well, isn't this interesting? You're afraid.",
        "LORELAI: Of what?",
        "EMILY: That Rory will enjoy the club and have a good time without you.",
        "LORELAI: That's crazy.",
        "EMILY: I agree.",
        "LORELAI: I'm not afraid.",
        "EMILY: Then let her go.",
        "LORELAI: She won't enjoy it, Mom.",
        "EMILY: Well why don't you just let Rory decide?",
        "LORELAI: Because Rory is the sweetest kid in the whole world and she won't tell you that she doesn't want to go becasue she's too afraid of hurting your feelings.",
        "EMILY: Oh I'm sure you can give her some coaching to help her get over that.",
        "LORELAI: I'm not trying to hurt your feelings, Mom. Believe it or not, this is not about you.",
        "EMILY: Of course it's about me. If Rory goes and has a good time without you, then I win.",
        "LORELAI: OK, Bob Barker. Listen, Rory knocks herself out all week at Chilton. Weekends are the only time she has to unwind and have fun.",
        "EMILY: With you?",
        "LORELAI: I'm there.",
        "EMILY: So let me get this straight. There's no way that Rory can possibly enjoy a weekend day with her grandfather.",
        "LORELAI: You're just going to twist it all around, aren't you?",
        "EMILY: And you know your daughter so well that you don't even have to ask her opinion on this. She'd be miserable and you know it.",
        "LORELAI: I am so setting myself up here, but yes, she would be miserable.",
        "EMILY: That sounds a little controlling to me.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah I walked right into that.",
        "EMILY: Interesting, isn't it, you being the one who's controlling?",
        "LORELAI: I am not being --",
        "EMILY: According to you I was the only one in the family with that particular gift.",
        "LORELAI: Mom I never said that!",
        "EMILY: I guess you and I are more alike that you thought, aren't we?",
        "LORELAI: You win.",
        "(Later, Lorelai and Rory are leaving for home.)",
        "LORELAI: (sighs) Oh, man, did you get blindsided? I'm so sorry.",
        "RORY: That's OK.",
        "LORELAI: I tried to stop it, I swear.",
        "RORY: I know. Maybe it won't be that bad.",
        "LORELAI: Maybe it won't.",
        "RORY: Maybe I'll like it.",
        "LORELAI: Maybe you will.",
        "RORY: Maybe you could come with me.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, is there a \"you're crazy\" team? 'Cause I think they'd make you captain.",
        "RORY: Please?",
        "LORELAI: Rory, I love you. I would take a bullet for you. But I'd rather stick something sharp in my ear than go to the club with you.",
        "RORY: Fine.",
        "LORELAI: I'd rather slide down a banister of razor blades and land in a pool of alcohol than go to the club with you.",
        "RORY: I got it.",
        "LORELAI: Don't stop me, I'm on a roll. I'd rather eat my own hand than go to the club with you. Ooh, I'd rather get my face surgically altered to look like that lunatic rich lady with the lion head than go to the club with you.",
        "RORY: Would you like me to drive so you can continue your diatribe?",
        "LORELAI: Would ya? Thanks. I'd rather cut off my head and use it as a punch bowl than go to the club with you.",
        "(Cut to the inn. Lorelai escorts the brides, Jackie and Jessica, and their mother around the grounds.)",
        "LORELAI: You'll walk down here over the bridge with the swans floating by and the music playing --",
        "JACKIE: What are they doing with those purple flowers?",
        "LORELAI: Just decorating the bridge.",
        "JACKIE: I didn't want purple flowers. I wanted pink.",
        "JESSICA: And I wanted blue.",
        "LORELAI: So I thought violet would be a nice compromise.",
        "JACKIE: But we paid for pink flowers.",
        "JESSICA: And blue flowers.",
        "MRS. SHALES: You did not pay for anything. I told her to decorate with violet flowers and while it's very nice of her to try to take the heat for me it's certainly not necessary. If you don't like it, buy your own flowers. (silence) Yes, I thought so. Now go away. My Advil is wearing off.",
        "(The twins walk away.)",
        "MRS. SHALES: Their father spoiled them.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, they're just excited.",
        "MRS. SHALES: They're spoiled. And they won't move away.",
        "MRS. SHALES: Now, disaster list. What if it rains?",
        "LORELAI: We'll put up tents.",
        "MRS. SHALES: What if it's too windy?",
        "LOREAI: Well, then we'll secure everything and put extra hair spray in everybody's hair.",
        "MRS. SHALES: Too hot?",
        "LORELAI: We'll use umbrellas and fans that won't cause any damage because of the things that have been secured and the hair that has been sprayed.",
        "MRS. SHALES: So I have nothing to worry about.",
        "LORELAI: Nope.",
        "MRS. SHALES: Well there must be something.",
        "LORELAI: Listen, I have everything under control. Why don't you go up to your room and have a fabulous bubble bath and I'll send up some wine and a masseuse who bears a remarkable resemblance to Antonio Banderas.",
        "MRS. SHALES: How remarkable?",
        "LORELAI: Get ready to applaud.",
        "MRS. SHALES: This is my favorite place in the whole world.",
        "(Inside the inn Michel is handling gift baskets.)",
        "LORELAI: (to an employee) Could you send Maury up to room twelve in about twenty minutes? Thanks. (to Michel) So, any problems?",
        "MICHEL: With the wedding or my life?",
        "LORELAI: One guess -- and I'll give you a hint: it's not your life.",
        "MICHEL: Do you stage these events to torture me?",
        "LORELAI: Yes.",
        "MICHEL: Job well done.",
        "LORELAI: OK, let's start again. Any problems?",
        "MICHEL: Guests are checked in, baskets are given out, and 200,000 tons of Jordan almonds have been delivered.",
        "LORELAI: OK, good. Did Rory call?",
        "MICHEL: No.",
        "LORELAI: Hmm. She's golfing all day with my father and I'm half expecting this big \"save me\" call to come in -- you don't care at all do you?",
        "MICHEL: To me you are the teacher in the Charlie Brown cartoon.",
        "LORELAI: OK, forget it. So, have the grooms arrived? Their plane was supposed to get in a 7 so I'm surprised they're not here by now.",
        "MICHEL: Well maybe they made a run for it.",
        "LORELAI: Ooh, somebody got stood up at the prom.",
        "MICHEL: Oh. Dear.",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "(Male twins have just walked in the front door.)",
        "MICHEL: Are those -- ?",
        "LORELAI: No. It would be too --",
        "(The brides rush into the grooms' arms.)",
        "LORELAI: -- weird.",
        "MICHEL: You kept this from me on purpose.",
        "LORELAI: It's like a really snooty Doublemint commercial.",
        "MICHEL: Just let me know when the midgets and clowns arrive.",
        "(Michel tries to leave.)",
        "LORELAI: Oh, no, no, no. You have to get them all settled in.",
        "MICHEL: I'm not talking to them.",
        "LORELAI: Yes you are.",
        "MICHEL: Well I'm not talking to them nicely.",
        "(Cut to Emily and Richard's house.)",
        "RICHARD: It's after 8:00. She should be here already.",
        "EMILY: She'll be here.",
        "RICHARD: You're supposed to tee off at your designated time.",
        "EMILY: You pay good money to that place. You'll tee off when you tee off. Is that what you're wearing?",
        "RICHARD: Yes.",
        "EMILY: Hmm.",
        "RICHARD: What's wrong with what I'm wearing?",
        "EMILY: Nothing. It's fine.",
        "RICHARD: This whole thing is absurd.",
        "EMILY: She's your granddaughter.",
        "RICHARD: She's a sixteen year old who would rather be at the mall.",
        "EMILY: Make sure you show her all around the club, especially the rose garden.",
        "RICHARD: I am not a guide.",
        "EMILY: And make sure you take her to lunch and have her get dessert.",
        "RICHARD: No one said anything about lunch.",
        "EMILY: I hope Lorelai's clubs are still in good shape.",
        "RICHARD: Emily you are not listening to me. I will teach her to play golf, as promised by you, but lunch is out of the question.",
        "EMILY: You have to eat.",
        "RICHARD: Yes, but --",
        "EMILY: So you'll eat together. Do you ahve sunscreen?",
        "(The doorbell rings.)",
        "RICHARD: Emily.",
        "(The doorbell rings again.)",
        "EMILY: She's here.",
        "RICHARD: Ah, 8:30. We must remember to buy her a watch.",
        "EMILY: Richard, so help me God, you will be sweet to this girl and make this a memorable day for her. This is the first time we've gotten to show our granddaughter off at the club and it means a great deal to my happiness -- and yours -- that this day go well. Are we clear?",
        "(Silence. Emily opens the door.)",
        "EMILY: Rory, hello.",
        "RORY: Sorry I'm late.",
        "EMILY: Nonsense. You're right on time.",
        "RORY: Hi, Grandpa.",
        "RICHARD: Rory, nice to see you.",
        "EMILY: This is a perfect day for golfing, isn't it Richard?",
        "RICHARD: It was cooler at 8.",
        "RORY: Am I dressed OK? I didn't have any of those short pant things.",
        "EMILY: Well, actually there is something missing. Oh, wait a minute...",
        "(She puts a hat on Rory's head.)",
        "EMILY Here you go. Now you look just like Tiger Woods.",
        "RORY: Wow, that's some hat. EMILY OK, off you go, you two. Have a wonderful time.",
        "RORY: We will.",
        "RICHARD: You bet.",
        "(Cut to Richard and Rory walking along the golf course.)",
        "RORY: Is it hard to become a member here?",
        "RICHARD: Everyone has to go through a thorough screening process.",
        "RORY: Kind of like the FBI?",
        "RICHARD: We're much more thorough than that.",
        "RORY: Wow.",
        "RICHARD: Yes. Did you know the merger of Forscape and D.S.S.",
        "RORY: Really.",
        "RICHARD: International finance will never be the same and all because of a lost golfing bet.",
        "RORY: That's crazy.",
        "RICHARD: Well that's high finance. Well, here we are. Now, what do you know about golf?",
        "RORY: That it's a good walk spoiled?",
        "RICHARD: (sighs) Well, your driver is the most powerful club in your bag, and as such, it can be your most valuable asset or your greatest liability. To wield it properly requires a precise combination of confidence and humility.",
        "RORY: Confidence and humility. Got it.",
        "RICHARD: There you are. That's a pretty good natural grip. Now, line the toe of your left foot up with the ball. That's right. Now, drop this shoulder a little bit. Now, keeping your left arm firm, draw the club back, swing it cleanly through the ball.",
        "(Rory takes a swing and hits the grass.)",
        "RORY: I'm betting that was wrong.",
        "RICHARD: (wearily) There are no rights and wrongs to the learning process. Try that again.",
        "(Rory does the same thing.)",
        "RORY: I'm betting that was wrong.",
        "(Cut to the kitchen at the inn.)",
        "SOOKIE: These are blueberries. I think ordered strawberries.",
        "JACKSON: I know but --",
        "SOOKIE: Yeah, no, I did. I wrote it down. I got a copy. (reading) Yeah, mushrooms, melon, endive, peaches, kiwi.",
        "JACKSON: Excuse me, crazy lady --",
        "SOOKIE: Oh I should make some kiwi ice cream. That would be good sometime.",
        "JACKSON: Sookie!",
        "SOOKIE: What?",
        "JACKSON: Listen. I know you ordered strawberries but they weren't any good so instead of selling you sub-standard strawberries, I brought blueberries.",
        "SOOKIE: I've got to make strawberry shortcake for 200 people. I think I'm gonna need strawberries.",
        "JACKSON: Use the blueberries.",
        "SOOKIE: To make what?",
        "JACKSON: Blueberry shortcake.",
        "SOOKIE: There's no such thing.",
        "JACKSON: Hey, the world was flat until someone took a boat trip.",
        "SOOKIE: Can I see these strawberries?",
        "JACKSON: No.",
        "SOOKIE: Just one?",
        "JACKSON: No.",
        "SOOKIE: How about a Polaroid?",
        "JACKSON: No.",
        "LORELAI: Coffee, coffee, coffee. Ooh, Sookie, can I take some of this cake home to Rory? She's going to need a special treat tonight. She's spending the entire day with my father golfing at the club.",
        "SOOKIE: No.",
        "JACKSON: Take the blueberries!",
        "SOOKIE: No.",
        "JACKSON: Ugh.",
        "LORELAI: Golfing was masterminded by my mother, of course. One minute we're having an excrutiating family dinner and the next she's manipulating my kid into spending her Sunday with my father at the country club. Oh, I can't talk about it anymore. It's making me too upset. Tell me something happy.",
        "(Sookie is about to cry.)",
        "SOOKIE: I can't make the strawberry shortcake.",
        "LORELAI: Wow. You suck at this game.",
        "MICHEL: The battle for soup versus salad is waging in the other room. Come quick and settle it, please, as I'm running out of French curse words that they won't understand.",
        "(Lorelai and Michel go into the lobby where the twin brides are in each others' faces arguing between soup and salad.)",
        "JESSICA: Soup --",
        "JACKIE: Salad...why are you making such a scene, Jessica? Jessica you are making a --",
        "(Mrs. Shales walks over to Lorelai and Michel.)",
        "MRS. SHALES: It's been 45 minutes of soup or salad. Soup or salad -- I can't do it anymore. Get me a cab. I'm going to go far away now and never come back.",
        "LORELAI: How about if the guests get a choice of soup or salad?",
        "MRS. SHALES: That -- that will work.",
        "LORELAI: Choice of soup or salad.",
        "SOOKIE: Got it.",
        "(The grooms join the brides.)",
        "LORELAI: It's so weird.",
        "SOOKIE: Which one is which?",
        "LORELAI: I don't know. I think the one on the right is Matt.",
        "MICHEL: No, the one on the left is Matt. The one on the right is Mark.",
        "LORELAI: That's very impressive.",
        "MICHEL: Yes, well, I'm very good at observing people, you know, learning the tics and traits, sound of their voices. It's a gift.",
        "SOOKIE: That one has a Post-It on its back.",
        "MICHEL: Oh, well, then that's Mark. The one on the right is Matt.",
        "LORELAI: You will go and take that off of him.",
        "MICHE: I will not. We can't all just call everyone 'sweetie' and get away with it.",
        "SOOKIE: Now, go with me, here. Let's say Mark walks into a hotel room and he sees his wife naked, but it's not his wife, it's his naked sister-in-law, and he has s*x with her. Would that be cheating?",
        "MICHEL: My head hurts.",
        "LORELAI: (laughing) I think no.",
        "SOOKIE: Really? Lucky.",
        "MICHEL: If you ask me this union belongs on a public access station. It's against the laws of nature and just this short of completely obscene.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, you won't be giving the wedding toast.",
