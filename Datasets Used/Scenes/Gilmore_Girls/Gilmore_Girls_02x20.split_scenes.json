        "[Lorelai and Rory are walking past the gazebo toward Luke's]",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: Nothing. Are you tilting?",
        "RORY: No.",
        "LORELAI: I think you're tilting.",
        "RORY: I'm not tilting.",
        "LORELAI: Do you wanna hold onto my purse? It might even you out.",
        "RORY: Stop anytime you like. What are you doing?",
        "LORELAI: Well, I'm gonna get a pen and put it on top of your head and see if it rolls off.",
        "RORY: Okay, see, this is not how you console the injured.",
        "LORELAI: You're right, I'm sorry. [pulls a book out of her purse] How about this?",
        "RORY: The Little Locksmith!",
        "LORELAI: And I got it at the bookstore, paid full price.",
        "RORY: Thank you!",
        "LORELAI: You're welcome \u0096 feel better?",
        "RORY: I do.",
        "LORELAI: Good. . .now can I put a pen on top of your head?",
        "RORY: No. Mom?",
        "LORELAI: Oh good, hold still.",
        "RORY: Forget the pen.",
        "LORELAI: Drat!",
        "RORY: When are you gonna tell me what happened between you and Luke? Was it bad? I mean, I'm sure it was bad, but how bad is bad?",
        "LORELAI: It was nothing.",
        "RORY: Really?",
        "LORELAI: Look, I was upset, he was upset, we had a thing. It's over, we're fine.",
        "RORY: A thing?",
        "LORELAI: A tiny thing.",
        "RORY: A tiny thing?",
        "LORELAI: A thinglet, if you will.",
        "RORY: You and Luke don't have thinglets very often.",
        "LORELAI: Oh no, Rory, everybody has thinglets, it's part of being a grown up.",
        "RORY: Well, what did he say? What did you say?",
        "LORELAI: Rory, please.",
        "RORY: Well, okay, fine, just answer me this \u0096 we are on our way to Luke's, right?",
        "LORELAI: Right.",
        "RORY: And when we get there, will we get in?",
        "LORELAI: Of course we'll get in.",
        "RORY: Will we get served?",
        "LORELAI: Yes.",
        "RORY: Will we get coffee?",
        "LORELAI: Maybe.",
        "RORY: Refills?",
        "LORELAI: Eventually.",
        "RORY: Free refills?",
        "LORELAI: In about a month.",
        "RORY: Okay, the thinglet has grown into a thing.",
        "LORELAI: Rory, Luke and I have fought before, God knows we'll fight again, but it's over, it's history. We'll go in, he'll be crabby, I'll be adorable, he'll forget everything and that, as they say, will be that.",
        "RORY: Okay.",
        "[They reach Luke's Diner \u0096 there is a crowd out front]",
        "LORELAI: Hey, is there a line?",
        "KIRK: Closed.",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "KIRK: It's closed.",
        "LORELAI: Luke's is closed?",
        "RORY: Luke's is never closed.",
        "KIRK: I know.",
        "LORELAI: Are you sure it's closed?",
        "KIRK: Well, first I read the sign and then I tried the door in case it was some sort of elaborate ruse.",
        "LORELAI: Designed to keep only you out?",
        "KIRK: There's precedent.",
        "LORELAI: Well, Luke's gone fishing. I think that's great.",
        "RORY: It is?",
        "LORELAI: Yes. He works hard, he needed a break, he took it. I think it's good, healthy.",
        "KIRK: For who? I have blood sugar issues.",
        "RORY: Mom -.",
        "LORELAI: Don't.",
        "RORY: It's because -.",
        "LORELAI: No, it isn't.",
        "RORY: But he never --.",
        "LORELAI: Well, now he did.",
        "RORY: But --.",
        "LORELAI: Rory, he took a trip. Don't read anything into it.",
        "RORY: It's because of the other night.",
        "LORELAI: No, it isn't. And even if it is, it'll go away. Everything'll be fine.",
        "KIRK: Speak for yourself. I left my wallet in there yesterday.",
        "[opening credits]",
        "CUT TO THE HUNGRY DINER",
        "[Lorelai and Rory are in another restaurant, standing near the door]",
        "LORELAI: Why are we standing here?",
        "RORY: Because the sign says \u0091wait to be seated'.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, but we're not automatons, we are rule breakers, and there are like fifty open tables.",
        "RORY: You're exaggerating.",
        "LORELAI: One, two, three, four, fifty \u0096 no I'm not.",
        "RORY: I'm sure someone will help us soon.",
        "LORELAI: We should be eating, I'm hungry, this is crazy. Don't they want us eating? Isn't that what the point of The Hungry Diner is \u0096 to feed the hungry diner? Or is the point of The Hungry Diner to keep the hungry diner hungry, in which case they should call it The Eternally Hungry Diner \u0091cause you're not gonna get any food here, loser.",
        "RORY: That would be quite a sign.",
        "LORELAI: Ugh, I'm giving one of these paper-topped turkey heads three seconds to seat us or I swear, I'm gonna start to just \u0096 .",
        "WAITRESS: [walks up to them] Two?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, please.",
        "[they follow the waitress toward a table]",
        "RORY: You're gonna what?",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "RORY: Well, you said you were gonna do something if somebody didn't help us in three seconds.",
        "LORELAI: I did?",
        "RORY: Yes, you did, and then the waitress came over and you never finished saying what you were gonna do.",
        "LORELAI: Honey, we gotta get some food into you, you're imagining things.",
        "RORY: What were you gonna do?",
        "LORELAI: Shh! You're getting screwy!",
        "RORY: Mom.",
        "LORELAI: Mom? I'm not your mom. Do you need help little girl?",
        "RORY: Oh my God.",
        "WAITRESS: How's this?",
        "LORELAI: It's, uh, perfect, thanks.",
        "WAITRESS: Can I bring you some coffee to start?",
        "LORELAI: To start and finish.",
        "WAITRESS: Need a little pick me up?",
        "LORELAI: Do I!",
        "WAITRESS: Back in a jif! [leaves]",
        "LORELAI: Okay, when she comes back, we're gonna grab her and hold her down and you tell her really ugly things about the world.",
        "RORY: Why don't you get your daughter to help you out with your evil plan?",
        "LORELAI: Okay, now, make nice. [opens menu] Oh, how convenient. They have pictures of all the food in case you've been living in a cave for the last fifty years and you have no idea what a stack of pancakes looks like.",
        "[waitress brings them their coffee]",
        "LORELAI: Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry.",
        "WAITRESS: Yes, Sweetie?",
        "LORELAI: What are the tiny cups for?",
        "WAITRESS: They're coffee cups, they're for coffee.",
        "LORELAI: What, are you running out or something?",
        "WAITRESS: I'm sorry?",
        "LORELAI: Never mind. Listen, we are very sleepy this morning, so would you happen to have something in a larger size, say a mug, a tureen, a small bowl of some kind?",
        "WAITRESS: A coffee bowl?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, a coffee bowl.",
        "RORY: Bring two, please.",
        "WAITRESS: We don't have coffee bowls, I'm sorry.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, well, then would you mind bringing. . .what do you think \u0096 two, three?",
        "RORY: Three's good.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, three of these cute little cuppy things? Oh, and could you leave the pot in the meantime?",
        "[waitress walks away]",
        "LORELAI: Well, looks like coffee, smells like coffee. . .",
        "RORY: [takes a sip and makes a face] The comparison stops there!",
        "LORELAI: This sucks.",
        "RORY: Just put a lot of stuff in there so you can't taste it.",
        "LORELAI: How am I gonna fit my three sugars into Barbie's Malibu dream cup here? It'll be all sugar and no coffee.",
        "RORY: You may prefer it that way.",
        "LORELAI: Man. [glances over and sees Michel at another table] Well, well, well.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: I'll be right back. [walks over to Michel, who is reading a magazine] So, what's new for Fall? I hear the sailor suit is hot, hot, hot.",
        "MICHEL: What are you doing here?",
        "LORELAI: Luke's is closed this morning.",
        "MICHEL: By the health inspector, no doubt.",
        "LORELAI: So. . . this is where you have your breakfast, huh?",
        "MICHEL: Until this morning, yes.",
        "LORELAI: How's the grub?",
        "MICHEL: They make an excellent egg white omelet, no oil.",
        "LORELAI: Really?",
        "MICHEL: They use the spray. Can you leave now?",
        "LORELAI: How come you never told me about this place?",
        "MICHEL: Because then you might actually eat here and there would be no corner of my life which would be free of your incessant scrutiny. What are you doing with the fork?",
        "LORELAI: Can I have a bite?",
        "MICHEL: Can you what?",
        "LORELAI: Just a taste.",
        "MICHEL: Get away from me. [stands up to leave]",
        "LORELAI: Aw, Michel, don't go. Come eat with us.",
        "MICHEL: You'd like that, wouldn't you?",
        "LORELAI: No, not really.",
        "MICHEL: Good, it's a date.",
        "LORELAI: You, me, here tomorrow?",
        "MICHEL: Never. [leaves]",
        "[Lorelai walks back to Rory and sits down]",
        "LORELAI: Hey, know what? I'm beginning to like this place.",
        "RORY: I'm glad. Mom, I need to ask you a favor.",
        "LORELAI: Ask away.",
        "RORY: I need you to get me out of dinner tonight.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, Rory.",
        "RORY: Dean's coming home and he doesn't know about the accident and if I'm not there the second he gets home then someone else is gonna tell him about it and then that would be \u0096 .",
        "LORELAI: Horrible.",
        "RORY: Yes.",
        "LORELAI: I agree.",
        "RORY: I really hate to ask you this.",
        "LORELAI: Ah, forget about it.",
        "RORY: Really?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, absolutely. Make things right with Dean.",
        "RORY: I really appreciate this.",
        "LORELAI: No problem. In fact, it gives me a little extra time to work on my \u0091why Rory's wearing a cast' story for your grandparents.",
        "RORY: Yeah? What do you got so far?",
        "LORELAI: Really big bees.",
        "RORY: Huh. Well, it's good you've got the time.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, it is.",
        "CUT TO FRIDAY NIGHT DINNER",
        "[Lorelai and Emily are walking toward the living room]",
        "EMILY: I'm so sorry Rory isn't feeling well. Is it that flu that's been going around?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, yes, it is.",
        "EMILY: Horrible strain. Bunny Carlington-Munchausen has been bedridden for two straight weeks.",
        "LORELAI: Huh. Well, it must wipe her out just toting that name around.",
        "EMILY: I wonder if I should take a drink into Richard. I hate to disturb him while he's working.",
        "LORELAI: He's working, like work working?",
        "EMILY: That's right. His articles of incorporation arrived last week. He's rented an office. Your father is now the president and CEO of the Gilmore Group, an international insurance consulting firm.",
        "LORELAI: Wow, that's great. So, um, what's the. . .like, how does. . . what's his job?",
        "EMILY: He's a consultant.",
        "LORELAI: Meaning?",
        "EMILY: Your father is an international insurance consultant.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, yeah, but what exactly does that mean?",
        "EMILY: He consults on matters relating to international insurance.",
        "LORELAI: Wait, wait \u0096 when Dad goes to his new office, he sits down and he. . .",
        "EMILY: Consults with international clients on insurance matters.",
        "LORELAI: I don't know why we're not opening for Rickles.",
        "RICHARD: [from hallway] Dammit!",
        "EMILY: Richard, are you all right?",
        "RICHARD: [walks into the living room] No, I am not all right. That was Margie just now on the phone.",
        "EMILY: Oh, how is she?",
        "LORELAI: Who is she?",
        "EMILY: You know very well who Margie is. She's been your father's secretary since you were a child.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, Largie Margie. . .very clever when you're six.",
        "RICHARD: In answer to your question Emily, Margie is well. So well, in fact, that she has decided not to join me in my new business.",
        "EMILY: What?",
        "RICHARD: She's staying with the old firm.",
        "EMILY: But how could she? You were the only reason she even had a job at that firm.",
        "RICHARD: I went to great pains to remind her of just that.",
        "EMILY: Well, this is simply unacceptable. You and that rotund ingrate had an agreement.",
        "LORELAI: There was an agreement, in writing?",
        "RICHARD: Well, not in writing per se, but she helped me procure my new office, she arranged to have all my things sent over, all that was left was for her to accept my formal offer, a very generous one, if I may say so.",
        "EMILY: And she just turned you down?",
        "RICHARD: She had the gall to counteroffer. She kept insisting that I match her current salary.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, Dad, you weren't even offering to match the poor woman's salary?",
        "RICHARD: Well, Lorelai, the Gilmore Group is a fledgling enterprise. I can't afford to pay Margie her full salary right away.",
        "EMILY: But after twenty years, where is the woman's sense of loyalty?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, gee, I don't know. . .maybe with the company that's keeping her from having to stand in line for government cheese.",
        "RICHARD: I'm afraid, at this point, I don't know how to proceed.",
        "EMILY: Well, of course you don't.",
        "RICHARD: I had counted on this.",
        "EMILY: Of course you had.",
        "RICHARD: Perhaps I should reconsider going forward.",
        "EMILY: That may be best.",
        "LORELAI: Excuse me?",
        "RICHARD: I can't very well do it without Margie.",
        "EMILY: No one would expect you to.",
        "LORELAI: Guys, you can't be serious.",
        "EMILY: I wonder if it's too late to get out of my lease.",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "EMILY: You should look into that immediately, Richard.",
        "LORELAI: Whoa, whoa, whoa! There is a baby here desperately in need of some bath water.",
        "RICHARD: What is she saying Emily?",
        "EMILY: What are you saying Lorelai?",
        "LORELAI: I'm just saying there are other options to consider.",
        "RICHARD: Like what?",
        "LORELAI: Like hire another secretary.",
        "EMILY: Oh no. Your father's had other secretaries.",
        "RICHARD: Three in fact, each one worse than the previous one.",
        "EMILY: Until Margie.",
        "RICHARD: Margie was a gem.",
        "EMILY: Margie did everything for him.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, but Dad, there are plenty of other Margie's out there dying to be in that kind of codependent relationship with you. You will find one, trust me. Now she might not be named Margie but if you pay her enough you can probably call her whatever you want.",
        "RICHARD: I don't have time to find someone new. The office is a disaster. Everything is in boxes. I don't know where anything is or how anything works. . . the computers, the phones, even my office chair.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, Dad, I'll tell you what. Tomorrow afternoon after my business class, I will come to your office and we'll get you unpacked, we'll get you settled, and we'll find you someone as good as Margie, or at least cheaper.",
        "RICHARD: Oh, I hate to see you waste your time.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I'll blindfold you then.",
        "RICHARD: I don't know, I \u0096 .",
        "LORELAI: Dad, there's another Margie out there, honest. Just give it a chance.",
        "RICHARD: An office without Margie. . .",
        "EMILY: Seems inconceivable.",
        "LORELAI: Dream with me here folks.",
        "CUT TO DEAN'S HOUSE",
        "[Rory is sitting on the porch as Dean and his dad pull up in an SUV]",
        "DEAN: Hey.",
        "RORY: Hey.",
        "DEAN'S DAD: Hi Rory. [goes into the house]",
        "DEAN: What happened? What'd you do to your arm?",
        "RORY: [hands him an envelope] Here.",
        "DEAN: What is this?",
        "RORY: Just read it.",
        "DEAN: What \u0096 Rory, what's going on? Tell me how you hurt your arm.",
        "RORY: It's all in the letter.",
        "DEAN: But \u0096 .",
        "RORY: Read.",
        "DEAN: Uh. . .[starts reading] Well, I love you, too.",
        "RORY: Good \u0096 now just hold onto that feeling for a minute.",
        "DEAN: Why?",
        "RORY: Just \u0096 .",
        "DEAN: Read, all right, I'm reading. [reads some more] What?",
        "RORY: Keep going.",
        "DEAN: [reads some more] What?",
        "RORY: Turn it over.",
        "DEAN: [reads some more] What!",
        "RORY: Go on, you have like three more whats ahead of you.",
        "[Dean kicks his duffel bag and reads some more]",
        "RORY: It gets better at the end. I'll just stand here until you get there.",
        "DEAN: [reads some more] Is he really gone?",
        "RORY: Yes.",
        "DEAN: Okay. You wanna come in?",
        "RORY: What?",
        "DEAN: You can stay for dinner, my mom's making a roast. You like roast, right?",
        "RORY: Um, yeah, I like roast.",
        "DEAN: Okay, come on.",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "[Later that night, Lorelai and Rory are sitting at the kitchen table. Lorelai is covering Rory's cast with a plastic bag]",
        "RORY: And then we just watched TV.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, you mean you \u0091watched TV.' Use the air quotes, Sweetie.",
        "RORY: His little sister was there.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, so you watched TV. . .go on.",
        "RORY: And then he walked me home.",
        "LORELAI: That's it?",
        "RORY: That's it.",
        "LORELAI: Did he kiss you goodnight?",
        "RORY: Yup.",
        "LORELAI: But he didn't ask about the other night at all?",
        "RORY: Nope.",
        "LORELAI: Didn't ask about the car?",
        "RORY: Not once.",
        "LORELAI: And Jess?",
        "RORY: He just asked if he was really gone and that was it.",
        "LORELAI: Wow.",
        "RORY: I thought he would yell and scream. I though he would wanna break up \u0096 instead, he gave me his corn.",
        "LORELAI: He did? When?",
        "RORY: At dinner.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, so you were already eating. It wasn't just an out of the blue, \u0091And I give you my corn.' Okay, got it.",
        "RORY: Maybe it just hasn't sunk in yet, maybe he'll be mad tomorrow.",
        "LORELAI: Maybe Dean is even more terrific than we thought he was.",
        "RORY: It's not covering the whole cast.",
        "LORELAI: Relax, I'm not done. [gets a box of Saran wrap]",
        "RORY: Do you really think he's okay with it?",
        "LORELAI: Sounds like it.",
        "RORY: If the situation were reversed, I don't think I'd be okay with it.",
        "LORELAI: If the situation was reversed, I don't think Dean would've let Jess drive his car.",
        "RORY: I guess I should just be grateful then?",
        "LORELAI: Grateful, absolutely.",
        "RORY: [points to a stack of papers] What are these?",
        "LORELAI: These are resumes for your Grandpa's new secretary.",
        "RORY: There are like a hundred of them.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, well, the world is full of eager young people just waiting to have the life sucked out of them by Richard Gilmore. Okay, I'm finished \u0096 what do you think of that?",
        "RORY: If we were gazelles, we'd be the first ones eaten at the watering hole.",
        "LORELAI: Well, be thankful we're not gazelles. Now go take your shower. You're starting to look like you're starring in an independent film.",
        "[Rory starts to leave the kitchen]",

        "RICHARD: Uh, manual. . manual. . .",

        "RICHARD: I'll pass. Look at the scale of this place. I mean, no one needs all these options, it's oppressive. Hundreds of paper clips in every conceivable color and size. Now, who on Earth would buy these things?",
        "LORELAI: We would. [puts them in the cart] All right, now, what's the first thing you do when you get to the office in the morning?",

        "LORELAI: Nicely done, Dad. You won't be sorry.",

        "RICHARD: All right. This oughta do nicely for now. [picks out a small package of paper]",
        "LORELAI: What, are you going into business for two weeks? You are building an empire for crying out loud. Think big, Gilmore! Plus, if you get the box, it's cheaper. [puts huge box of paper into the cart]",
        "RICHARD: Say, how do you happen to know all of this?",
        "LORELAI: It's how we do it at the inn. You have to spend money to make money, my friend. It's a little tip from me to you.",
        "RICHARD: Good point. What else?",

        "RICHARD: My goodness, look at all the Post-Its. I had no idea they came in so many shapes and colors. I'm gonna get a twelve pack for myself in various hues.",
        "LORELAI: Wise move.",
        "RICHARD: And one for Emily. I have seen her post notes on her vanity mirror to remind her of various activities.",
        "LORELAI: Ah, she'll think it's Christmas.",
        "RICHARD: Done. Now, what else is on the hit parade?",
        "LORELAI: Well, it might be controversial, but I was thinking of something in the way of a three-hole punch if we can find one.",

        "LORELAI: I just didn't want you to worry, Mom.",
        "EMILY: Yes, well, clearly there was nothing to worry about. It was that car, wasn't it? The one her boyfriend made. Richard was dead set against letting her drive that death mobile.",

        "LORELAI: Mom, please.",
        "EMILY: Don't \u0091Mom, please' me. It was your responsibility to stop this, it was your responsibility to make sure that he did not \u0096",
        "RORY: I gave him the keys. I told him to drive. He wanted to drive back to Luke's and I said no. I wanted to keep on driving and that's when we got into the car accident. This is just as much my fault as it is his, maybe more.",
        "EMILY: Rory.",
        "LORELAI: I've got this, Mom. Can I see you in the hall for a second? [they walk into the hallway] Hey, what the hell was that?",

        "LORELAI: No one is treating you like that.",
        "RORY: Everyone is, the whole town is. . . Taylor, Babette, Dean. Everyone in my life, including you, is refusing to believe that I was just as responsible for what happened that night as Jess was.",
        "LORELAI: Really? Were you driving the car?",
        "RORY: No.",
        "LORELAI: Then you weren't as responsible.",
        "RORY: What if it'd been Dean, huh? What if Dean had been driving? Would everyone be assuming that it was his fault?",
        "LORELAI: No, because if Dean had been driving there wouldn't have been an accident because Dean is a much more responsible kid who loves you and would've been driving more responsibly.",
        "RORY: How do you know that Jess wasn't?",
        "LORELAI: Hi. . .it's Jess.",
        "RORY: Oh, right, Jess is the antichrist, I forgot. He wanted to get into an accident. He was looking for something to hit because he's a murderer with a death wish and he wanted to kill us both, right?",
        "LORELAI: I know you think that Jess is your friend, but he's not. He is a completely out of control, really angry kid who has no respect for Luke, who has no respect for me. . .",
        "RORY: It was an accident!",
        "LORELAI: And he was driving!",
        "RORY: So, what, no matter what I say, you're just gonna choose to blame Jess?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, I choose to blame Jess.",
        "RORY: Just because you hate him?",
        "LORELAI: That's right! I'm sorry, but when my daughter comes home broken I get to hate the guy who broke her. That's how it works. He's gone, I win. You are wearing a cast and I get to hate him forever!",

        "LORELAI: All right, well, I'll tell Mom, I'll drive you.",
        "RORY: No, it's okay. It's still early. I can catch my regular bus and. . .you go back in.",
