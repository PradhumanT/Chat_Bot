        "When Emily and Lorelai go to a spa for a weekend of relaxation, Emily lets her hair down, kicks up her heels and ends up bonding with Lorelai in a way that only her daughter could inspire. Thrilled that she has the house all to herself, Rory hopes to spend a quiet night at home doing laundry and eating Indian food. Her plans are foiled -- first by Paris, then by Jess, and finally by Dean. In the process, she discovers that she has a surprising savior, a secret suitor, and a skeptical sweetheart."

        "OPEN IN LUKE'S DINER",
        "[Luke's apartment is under construction. Luke delivers food to some customers, a chunk of the ceiling falls onto the table.]",
        "LUKE: Here you go. Geez, uh, sorry folks. Uh, here. . .there we go. Free coffee all around. You might wanna put your hand over that. There we go. [walks over to construction worker] Tom, what the hell is going on up there?",
        "TOM: We're redoing your apartment. What do you think is going on up there?",
        "LUKE: The ceiling's falling in. I've got customers eating drywall here.",
        "TOM: Oh, well, that can't be good.",
        "LUKE: You said minimal disruptions.",
        "TOM: Hey, this is minimal disruptions. Look, I need you to sign this change order.",
        "LUKE: What happened now?",
        "TOM: Well, we broke through this wall and we found some pipes that shouldn't be there. We gotta move them.",
        "LUKE: Move them where?",
        "TOM: Not sure. We gotta find out what they do first.",
        "LUKE: You're kidding?",
        "TOM: Oh yeah. There's nothing I like more than a good \u0091moving a pipe' joke.",
        "LUKE: Fine, one more week, that's it.",
        "TOM: Oh, sure, construction ultimatum. Ha, that's even funnier than my moving pipe joke.",
        "[Lorelai and Rory walk in]",
        "LORELAI: Hey.",
        "LUKE: Hey.",
        "LORELAI: Geez, look at this place.",
        "RORY: It's a mess.",
        "LORELAI: How long \u0096 .",
        "LUKE: Nope \u0096 can't sit here.",
        "LORELAI: Why not?",
        "LUKE: Three people got nailed in the head here earlier.",
        "LORELAI: But their food was okay, right?",
        "LUKE: Will you just move? [Lorelai's cell phone rings] Outside.",
        "LORELAI: You know, if I sit here one more second, I just might be outside. Order me some coffee.",
        "[Lorelai walks away; Jess walks over to the table and hands Rory an open umbrella]",
        "LUKE: Oh, you are really funny. You and Tom should put an act together. I'd leave it open.",
        "[cut to outside]",
        "LORELAI: Go ahead Mom, I can hear you now.",
        "EMILY: I wanted to know if you'd like a gift certificate for a weekend at the Birch Grove Spa.",
        "LORELAI: Are you serious?",
        "EMILY: I bid on it at the DAR Symphony Fundraiser and I won.",
        "LORELAI: Birch Grove? That's supposed to be an amazing place, why don't you go?",
        "EMILY: Oh, I've never had any real desire to go to a spa.",
        "LORELAI: Why'd you bid on it then?",
        "EMILY: It was for charity, I had to bid on something. And I certainly didn't want another portrait of George Washington. I've got four in the attic already.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I'd love it.",
        "EMILY: Good.",
        "LORELAI: Two days of total mind-numbing pampering. Massages, facials, aromatherapy.",
        "EMILY: My goodness, you make it sound like heaven.",
        "LORELAI: It's as close as you'll ever come to being a dog.",
        "EMILY: I beg your pardon?",
        "LORELAI: You know, a whole life of nothing but eating, sleeping, lying on your back and getting rubbed.",
        "EMILY: I'd love the comparison to stop there.",
        "LORELAI: Deal. Um, hey, when's it for?",
        "EMILY: This weekend, actually.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, well, I'll be there.",
        "EMILY: So will I.",
        "LORELAI: Excuse me?",
        "EMILY: Well, the certificate is for two, and since you make it sound like the most wonderful place in the world, I might as well try it with you.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, but - .",
        "EMILY: That's all right, isn't it, if I join you? You don't mind?",
        "LORELAI: No, I don't mind at all.",
        "EMILY: Wonderful. I'll pick you up tomorrow morning. You know, I'm actually looking forward to this.",
        "LORELAI: Oh yeah, me too. Thanks Mom. Buh bye.",
        "CUT TO INSIDE LUKE'S",
        "[Rory is sitting at the table holding the umbrella over her head. Lorelai walks in and sits down]",
        "LORELAI: I'm going to a spa with my mother.",
        "RORY: Lean forward.",
        "[opening credits]",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S BEDROOM",
        "[Lorelai is sitting on the bed as Rory walks around packing a suitcase]",
        "LORELAI: [on phone] So, then we're all confirmed. Uh, great. Thanks so much for your help. Okay, bye. [hangs up] Yeeessss!",
        "RORY: That was an evil yes.",
        "LORELAI: Not an evil yes. It's a \u0091yes, I'm pretty, but hello, I'm smart' kind of a yes.",
        "RORY: Oh, my mistake.",
        "LORELAI: So here's the deal \u0096 I go into my facial just as my mother is finishing her salt glow, which will end ten minutes after I've hit my scalp treatment which puts me in the watsu massage pool at least six minutes into her back facial. Uh, in fact, the day is so well planned, I won't see her until dinner which will be cut tragically short by the food poisoning I plan to contract.",
        "RORY: You are twelve and disgusting.",
        "LORELAI: I am trapped and desperate.",
        "RORY: You really think you can avoid Grandma the entire weekend?",
        "LORELAI: Hey, I'm nothing if not a great organizer. Now, let's talk about what you're gonna do tonight. Throwing a party, I hope? Inviting hundreds of bikers and lowlifes who are gonna trash the place?",
        "RORY: I am going to do laundry, watch TV, order Indian food and go to bed early.",
        "LORELAI: And then come the bikers and lowlifes who are gonna trash the place?",
        "RORY: I may even fall asleep on the couch with the TV on.",
        "LORELAI: When do the bikers and lowlifes get to trash the place?",
        "RORY: You're all packed.",
        "LORELAI: Rory, you have to do something bad when Mommy's out of town. It's the law. You're seen Risky Business, right? Now I'm not asking for a prostitution ring, but how about a floating craps game or something?",
        "RORY: I'll see what I can do.",
        "LORELAI: I would greatly appreciate it.",
        "[a car honks from outside]",
        "RORY: I think Grandma's here.",
        "LORELAI: What's she honking for? She hates honking. She calls it a mechanical bodily function. [looks out window] Ugh, geez.",
        "RORY: [looks out window] Oh, cool!",
        "CUT TO OUTSIDE",
        "[Emily is standing in front of a limousine as Rory and Lorelai walk out of the house]",
        "EMILY: Hello, hello, hello!",
        "LORELAI: What, are we going to the prom?",
        "EMILY: I just thought since this weekend is all about relaxing, we should start with the ride.",
        "RORY: This is cool, Grandma.",
        "EMILY: Thank you, Rory. So, are we all ready to go?",
        "LORELAI: I guess so, Miss Daisy. Bye sweets.",
        "RORY: Bye. Bye Grandma.",
        "EMILY: Goodbye Rory.",
        "RORY: Have a good time.",
        "LORELAI: Bikers and lowlifes.",
        "RORY: I'll get right on it.",
        "CUT TO CHILTON CLASSROOM",
        "TEACHER: In general, the lab reports weren't bad \u0096 but they weren't great either, which leads me to question whether everyone has the grasp of electrochemistry I prefer before we move on. To that end, I will be giving another test on Tuesday covering chapters fourteen through eighteen in your textbooks, as well as the material from lab. Now please proceed with the assignment we all started yesterday, as that too will be included on the test.",
        "PARIS: Madeline?",
        "MADELINE: What?",
        "PARIS: What are you guys doing tonight?",
        "MADELINE: It's Friday night.",
        "PARIS: So you've got dates?",
        "MADELINE: Well, yeah, why?",
        "PARIS: I was kind of hoping you could study with me.",
        "MADELINE: On a Friday night?",
        "PARIS: Yes.",
        "MADELINE: But we've got dates.",
        "LOUISE: What is she saying?",
        "MADELINE: She wants us to study with her.",
        "LOUISE: On a Friday night?",
        "MADELINE: Yeah.",
        "LOUISE: But we've got dates.",
        "PARIS: I know you have dates, I was hoping maybe you'd cancel them.",
        "MADELINE: To study?",
        "PARIS: Yes.",
        "MADELINE: On a Friday night?",
        "LOUISE: What'd she say?",
        "MADELINE: She wants us to cancel our dates to study.",
        "LOUISE: On a Friday night?",
        "MADELINE: That's what she said.",
        "LOUISE: But we have - .",
        "PARIS: Oh my God, forget it! [walks over to Rory] So, I suppose that you have big Friday night plans also?",
        "RORY: Well, kind of.",
        "PARIS: So the fact that I'm seeing my entire Harvard career slip away apparently is of no interest to anyone?",
        "RORY: What are you talking about?",
        "PARIS: I got an A-minus, okay?",
        "RORY: So?",
        "PARIS: What do you mean, so? I got an A-minus. I have never gotten an A-minus. I just can't focus lately. Things are so weird at my house. My dad finally figured out exactly how much it was gonna cost him to divorce my mom, so now he's back and it's bad enough that I wasted all that time crunching the numbers with him, but now that he's back, they're fighting and redecorating. The place is a mess. I need help.",
        "RORY: Look, I can't tonight, but if you're still freaked out after the quiz on Tuesday, I will spend everyday next week helping you prepare for the final, okay?",
        "PARIS: I guess.",
        "RORY: Relax. It will be fine, I promise.",
        "PARIS: All I had to do was move a decimal point and none of this would've happened.",
        "CUT TO BIRCH GROVE SPA",
        "[Emily and Lorelai walk into the lobby]",
        "EMILY: Oh, look at this place. It's lovely. And that smell \u0096 what is that, eucalyptus?",
        "LORELAI: I don't know.",
        "EMILY: Well, it's lovely. Oh Lorelai, come over here, look. They have cucumber slices in the water.",
        "LORELAI: Oh wow! Now if they have ranch dressing in the soap dispensers, this place is great.",
        "EMILY: You know what? I love it here.",
        "LORELAI: Hm. Careful Mom, that's how they get you in the Moonies.",
        "EMILY: I feel more relaxed already. Mm, that's the most delicious water I've ever had. Have a sip.",
        "LORELAI: Let's just check in, shall we?",
        "EMILY: Okay. [they walk to the front desk] Hello, I'm Emily Gilmore. This is my daughter, Lorelai.",
        "BOBBY: Ah, yes, welcome to Birch Grove. My name is Bobby. I have everything all set for you. Do you have luggage?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, it's in the Luca Brasi mobile out front.",
        "BOBBY: Okay, well, we can take care of that for you. Here are your room keys and a copy of all of your spa activities. You ladies are booked solid, I see.",
        "EMILY: Well, we intend to leave here completely different people.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, I'm going to be Ted Nugent.",
        "BOBBY: Anyhow, your rooms are right down this hall. Fruit and yogurt is served by the pool in the mornings, and your lunch and dinner seatings are on that itinerary. Any questions?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, where can one get a cup of coffee around here?",
        "BOBBY: Ah, we don't serve anything with caffeine here.",
        "LORELAI: And you think that's safe?",
        "EMILY: Thank you, Bobby. We're sure we're going to have a wonderful time.",
        "LORELAI: Mom, there's no coffee.",
        "EMILY: It won't kill you to go two days without coffee, Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: No, I think it will.",
        "EMILY: Lorelai, just focus on all the pampering we're going to have. Look at all the wonderful things we have to look forward to.",
        "LORELAI: Oh no.",
        "EMILY: What?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, um, I'll be right back. They screwed up our appointments.",
        "EMILY: Again?",
        "LORELAI: What do you mean, again?",
        "EMILY: Well, on the way to your house I called to confirm our schedule and found out they had us booked separately for every single one of our treatments. Luckily, I insisted on speaking to a manager and was able to straighten everything out. Yes, those are right.",
        "LORELAI: They are?",
        "EMILY: I even had them move the pedicure tubs together in the same room so we can talk during it.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, I'm really gonna need a cup of coffee.",
        "EMILY: Have some cucumber water.",
        "LORELAI: No, see, that's not gonna do it because it's \u0096 .",
        "EMILY: Drink, Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: \u0096 cucumber water. Yuck.",
        "CUT TO STARS HOLLOW",
        "[Rory and Dean are kissing by a tree]",
        "RORY: Wow, your lung capacity certainly has improved.",
        "DEAN: Well, I've been playing a lot more basketball lately.",
        "RORY: Yet another reason to continue the fight to keep physical education in schools.",
        "DEAN: So, tonight.",
        "RORY: Yes?",
        "DEAN: I was thinking.",
        "RORY: Yes?",
        "DEAN: Since your mother's gonna be gone.",
        "RORY: Mm hmm.",
        "DEAN: Maybe I'd come over.",
        "RORY: Oh.",
        "DEAN: What?",
        "RORY: Actually, I was thinking of pulling kind of a hermit thing tonight.",
        "DEAN: Why?",
        "RORY: I don't know. J.D. Salinger seems to dig it.",
        "DEAN: You don't want me to come over?",
        "RORY: No, I just. . .I almost never get the house all to myself and I thought with my mom gone, I can finally do my laundry exactly the way I like it. You know, not just separated into whites and colors, but the colors separated into darks, mediums, and lights, with a separate pile for white T-shirts and T-shirts with some kind of writing on them, like, you know, Rock Star, Evil, or Kafka was here.",
        "DEAN: You wanna be alone to do laundry?",
        "RORY: And watch TV and eat the Indian food that I love but my mom hates the smell of and go to bed early and. . .are you mad?",
        "DEAN: Why would I be mad? You wanna spend tonight alone.",
        "RORY: But hey, tomorrow, the whole day is all about you. I mean it, from morning \u0091til night. You plan it, or I'll plan it, or we can get a professional to plan it, whatever you want. Just don't be mad.",
        "DEAN: I'm not. I'm not mad.",
        "RORY: Good.",
        "DEAN: I'm confused, but I'm not mad.",
        "RORY: Fine",
        "DEAN: I'm a saint, but I'm not mad.",
        "RORY: Thank you.",
        "DEAN: You're welcome.",
        "RORY: So, deep breath and. . .",
        "CUT TO BIRCH GROVE SPA",
        "[Lorelai is in her room unpacking. She hears knocking and opens the door to the hallway. No one's there, so she opens another door. Emily walks in wearing a bathrobe.]",
        "EMILY: How do I look?",
        "LORELAI: Like a landlady. What is this?",
        "EMILY: I got adjoining rooms so we don't have to go out in the hallway to get to each other.",
        "LORELAI: Great thinking!",
        "EMILY: God, this robe is fabulous. How do they get it so soft?",
        "LORELAI: Well, I think having about forty other people wear it first is part of the secret.",
        "EMILY: Oh, stop it. So are you all ready for our skin rejuvenating and revitalizing collagen facial and eye treatment?",
        "LORELAI: Almost.",
        "EMILY: It has vitamin C and plant extracts in it, which is the hottest thing in skin care these days. And the eye treatment is supposed to reduce puffiness and minimize the appearance of fine lines.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, no more brochures for you. All right, I'm ready, let's go.",
        "EMILY: Aren't you gonna wear your robe?",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "EMILY: Your robe, you're supposed to wear your robe.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, well, I'm sure they'll give me one when I get there.",
        "EMILY: But these robes are wonderful.",
        "LORELAI: Mom.",
        "EMILY: They help you relax.",
        "LORELAI: We're late, Mom.",
        "EMILY: They're wonderful, relaxing robes.",
        "LORELAI: Oh my God.",
        "EMILY: And yet, you stand there like it's some badge of honor not to put on your robe like everyone else in this place. [Lorelai goes into the bathroom to change] This isn't for me, you know, it's for you. I already have on my robe. I'm already relaxed. What are you doing?",
        "LORELAI: [from bathroom] You're kidding me, right?",
        "EMILY: Well, hurry up, we're gonna be late.",
        "LORELAI: [opens bathroom door] Happy?",
        "EMILY: Apparently you didn't see the matching slippers.",
        "CUT TO FACIAL ROOM",
        "FACIALIST: So, how are we doing?",
        "LORELAI: So good.",
        "FACIALIST: Okay. Well, I'm gonna leave you to sit for a few minutes, so just relax and enjoy, and I'll be right back.",
        "LORELAI: Thanks.",
        "[As the facialist leaves, Lorelai closes her eyes. Emily quietly enters the room and sits down next to Lorelai.]",
        "EMILY: Are your feet sweating?",
        "LORELAI: Mom?",
        "EMILY: Those booties make my feet sweat. Don't they make your feet sweat?",
        "LORELAI: What are you doing in my room?",
        "EMILY: Magda left me sitting for twenty minutes. Fine time to take a coffee break.",
        "LORELAI: She's not taking a coffee break. Your skin is supposed to be absorbing the moisture in your mask \u0096 in your room.",
        "EMILY: Let's see what's next on our agenda, shall we? Stop moving Lorelai, you'll electrocute yourself. Ooh, the Egyptian mud bath. I wonder if the mud bath is one of those things you see in brochures where they wrap you in towels like you're in a cocoon of some sort. That might be nice. Especially if their towels are as good as their robes because I just love these robes. I wonder where they get these robes. Shouldn't be so hard to find the manufacturer. I could order a few of them. One for me, one for you and one for Rory.",
        "CUT TO HALLWAY",
        "[Lorelai and Emily walk down the hallway in their robes]",
        "EMILY: I still can't get over it, it really was mud. I mean, I know it said mud bath but I didn't really think they meant a real mud bath. And the odd thing is I should've been more repulsed by it. Sitting in a tub of hot dirt, which is basically what mud is, should've made me ill, and yet I really enjoyed it. Did yours have twigs? Mine had twigs, and when I asked the woman about them, she told me they were there because of the healing qualities. . .",
        "[they walk through a door marked \u0091Quiet Room.' A few seconds later, the door opens and Lorelai ushers Emily out into the hall]",
        "EMILY: What are you doing? Lorelai, stop it! You're pushing me!",
        "[Lorelai bangs on the door, showing Emily the \u0091Quiet Room' sign, then they walk back into the room]",
        "CUT TO MASSAGE ROOM",
        "[Lorelai and Emily are both getting massages.]",
        "MASSEUR: How's the pressure \u0096 too much?",
        "LORELAI: Yup.",
        "MASSEUR: Sorry, I'll go lighter.",
        "EMILY: Your hands are amazing. Compliment your masseur's hands, Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: Oh my God.",
        "EMILY: Excuse me?",
        "LORELAI: Nothing.",
        "EMILY: You were muttering under your breath. Years of experience have taught me that when you do that, it's usually about me.",
        "LORELAI: Mom, you signed us up for a couple's massage.",
        "EMILY: So?",
        "LORELAI: A couple's massage is for a couple \u0096 not a couple of people.",
        "EMILY: It's more efficient this way. We'll both be finished at the same time.",
        "LORELAI: Mom, do you know what most people who get these massages do about five minutes after it's over? They have s*x, together, probably while wearing their robes.",
        "EMILY: Could the two of you excuse us for a moment please? Thank you. [the masseurs leave] Well, that was appalling!",
        "LORELAI: Well, that was true!",
        "EMILY: You're just determined to spoil this, aren't you, Lorelai?",
        "LORELAI: Why, because I want a quiet, private massage?",
        "EMILY: You've been pouting and sulking and sighing.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, I have not been sighing.",
        "EMILY: Rolling your eyes, mumbling.",
        "LORELAI: Well, that's how I detox.",
        "EMILY: Ever since we got here, you've made it your mission to be as miserable as possible.",
        "LORELAI: That's not true.",
        "EMILY: It's completely true. And if you don't care that you're hurting my feelings, maybe you care that you're wasting all your relaxing time acting like a petulant four-year-old.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I'm sorry.",
        "EMILY: Do you want me to try to get myself another room?",
        "LORELAI: No.",
        "EMILY: I saw a supply closet down the hall. Maybe my masseur could finish me in there.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, Mom.",
        "EMILY: Or perhaps I could just roll myself against a stucco wall, eliminate the need for a masseur altogether.",
        "LORELAI: Lie down Mom, please.",
        "EMILY: If you say so. Lorelai?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, Mom?",
        "EMILY: Would you go get the boys, please?",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE",

I saw him in the diner the day I came to Stars Hollow and I thought he was cute and since I'm not great at the whole \u0091batting the eyelashes, look at my belly shirt' kind of thing, I asked Rory to help me. I thought if she could maybe get him over here, we'd have a chance to talk and. . .I don't know, it seems totally stupid now and it obviously didn't work \u0096 shock, but that's why he was here. Thanks for trying to cover for me.",
