        "OPEN AT LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "[Rory pulls up in her car, grabs some bags from the trunk, then walks into the house. An alarm starts blaring.]",
        "LORELAI: Oh, crap! [tries to turn off the alarm]",
        "RORY: What's going on? Is it the smoke detector? Are we on fire?",
        "LORELAI: It's not the smoke detector, it's the alarm!",
        "RORY: What alarm?",
        "LORELAI: Our alarm.",
        "RORY: We don't have an alarm.",
        "LORELAI: Well, then, we have really angry rats. Did you cut your hair?",
        "RORY: Well, I just trimmed it.",
        "LORELAI: You didn't tell me you were cutting your hair.",
        "RORY: It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.",
        "LORELAI: A spur-of-the-moment, \"let's not tell my mother I'm pulling a G.I. Jane\"?",
        "RORY: Are we seriously gonna have this conversation now during the air raid?",
        "LORELAI: You're right. Come on. [leads her to the other side of the room]",
        "RORY: What are we doing?",
        "LORELAI: I figured out that there is a motion detector, and if you stand over here, it can't see you and calms down.",
        "RORY: Great, so what now?",
        "LORELAI: We wait. So why didn't you tell me you were getting your hair cut?",
        "RORY: It's just a trim.",
        "LORELAI: To the Braille Institute, it's just a trim.",
        "RORY: Do you like it?",
        "LORELAI: Will you put it back if I don't?",
        "RORY: Mom!",
        "LORELAI: Yes, I like it.",
        "RORY: Thank you.",
        "[the alarm stops]",
        "RORY: Oh, thank God.",
        "LORELAI: Feels good when it's over, huh?",
        "RORY: This is crazy. When did we get an alarm?",
        "LORELAI: Well, apparently, Kirk. . .",
        "RORY: Oh, no.",
        "LORELAI: . . .has recently joined the Stars Hollow Security Company.",
        "RORY: Oh, no.",
        "LORELAI: And apparently, now that I'm the pretty spinster living all alone, he's concerned for my safety.",
        "RORY: Did he tell you all this?",
        "LORELAI: Do you think I labeled myself the pretty spinster?",
        "RORY: What did you say?",
        "LORELAI: I haven't talked to him face-to-face. I come home to this and there was a note and his card and his gun.",
        "RORY: Oh, jeez!",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, and then when I called the alarm-response center to complain about the alarm, no one answered. I had to leave a message with Meg - she sweeps up.",
        "RORY: I can't even believe there's a security company in Stars Hollow. Nothing ever happens here.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, that is not true. Plenty happens here.",
        "RORY: Like what?",
        "LORELAI: Like, people now break into your houses and install alarm systems.",
        "RORY: I heard about that.",
        "LORELAI: And we have a new mail carrier.",
        "RORY: We do?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, so now if you wanna get your mail, you just have to go see Miss Patty.",
        "RORY: Why?",
        "LORELAI: 'Cause that's where he brings it. He brings Babette's mail to Andrew's, Norma's mail to the deli, and Taylor still hasn't found his mail, which I have to admit is kind of fun.",
        "RORY: I rescind my previous statement. This place is hopping.",
        "LORELAI: So, did you eat yet?",
        "RORY: Nope. I thought I'd let you feed me.",
        "LORELAI: Sure. I can feed you, but I can't know if you're getting your hair cut.",
        "RORY: I will never do anything again without telling you - happy?",
        "LORELAI: I don't know. I'm finding this whole guilt thing rather satisfying. [Rory starts to walk away] No, no, where are you going? [The alarm starts blaring again] Agh! Why did you do that?",
        "RORY: I was gonna get my laundry!",
        "LORELAI: You made it mad!",
        "RORY: I didn't mean to!",
        "LORELAI: Back in the corner, back in the corner!",
        "RORY: Oh.",
        "LORELAI: No place like home, huh?",
        "RORY: Yeah.",
        "[opening credits]",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "[Lorelai is making a trail of Post-It notes on the floor through the house; Rory comes out of her bedroom]",
        "RORY: Mom?",
        "LORELAI: Follow the Post-It's.",
        "RORY: Does our life seem at all ridiculous to you?",
        "LORELAI: I spent all morning carefully tracking that motion detector.",
        "RORY: What an excellent use of your time.",
        "LORELAI: We're good as long as we stay on the path.",
        "RORY: So I should follow the yellow stick road?",
        "LORELAI: We'll be here all week, try the veal. Stop.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: Read.",
        "RORY: \"Crouch down and hop.\" Oh, come on.",
        "LORELAI: The motion-detector beam at the top of the staircase dips very low over there.",
        "RORY: You seriously want me to crouch down and hop?",
        "LORELAI: Like a little hunchbacked bunny.",
        "RORY: You know, I had decided that if I ever went to therapy, I was gonna leave you out of it, but now. . .",
        "LORELAI: Okay, you can stand up.",
        "RORY: Did you at least call the stupid security company again?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, Meg sends her love. Don't worry - I'll stop by on my way to the inn. And what are your plans today, Persis Khambata?",
        "RORY: Well, today, I'm going to do nothing but hang out in town, read, veg, drink coffee, and have the perfect Stars Hollow day.",
        "LORELAI: Look out. I get to go over to the inn and hear a contractor laugh at me every time I say, \"But that won't cost too much more, right?\"",
        "RORY: Enjoy.",
        "LORELAI: Late lunch at Luke's?",
        "RORY: You're on. So, uh, which way do I go?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, just follow the Post-It's.",
        "RORY: But they're going in two different directions.",
        "LORELAI: They are?",
        "RORY: Look.",
        "LORELAI: Oh. I must have kicked some out of the way by accident.",
        "RORY: Well, which one do I take?",
        "LORELAI: Which looks more intentional?",
        "RORY: No Post-It path looks intentional.",
        "LORELAI: I'm drawing a complete blank.",
        "RORY: You seriously don't remember?",
        "LORELAI: Sorry.",
        "RORY: Well, how are we supposed to get out of our house?",
        "[Lorelai, imitating Jeannie from I Dream of Jeannie, crosses her arms, nods her head, and blinks]",
        "LORELAI: Unng!",
        "RORY: I hate Kirk.",
        "CUT TO THE GAZEBO",
        "[Rory is sitting on the bench reading and listening to music. A man walks up and sets down a box]",
        "RORY: Whoa. What's going on?",
        "MAN: I'm just setting things up for tomorrow.",
        "RORY: Oh, tomorrow. What's -",
        "MAN 2: Heads up!",
        "[another man throws a package of tablecloths to the man in the gazebo]",
        "RORY: Whoa.",
        "MAN: I think you may need to move.",
        "RORY: Yeah, I kinda got that. Excuse me. What's tomorrow?",
        "[Across the lawn, Lindsay and her mom are talking with a wedding planner]",
        "LINDSAY: . . .tons of tulle so that everything looks like frosting.",
        "MRS. LISTER: She's our only daughter - frost the town.",
        "LINDSAY: Now, where should we put the poster? I want to make sure everybody sees it.",
        "MRS. LISTER: Oh, what about next to the cake?",
        "LINDSAY: Yes, next to the cake.",
        "[Rory walks away in the other direction]",
        "CUT TO KIM'S ANTIQUES",
        "[Rory walks in]",
        "RORY: Lane.",
        "LANE: Rory.",
        "RORY: Have you heard of a phone? Because as my friend, it is your responsibility to use it to call me and tell me that my ex-boyfriend's wedding is on Sunday so I'm not accidentally in it.",
        "LANE: What?",
        "RORY: I'm sitting out in the gazebo, reading, and this guy almost brains me with a stack of tablecloths.",
        "LANE: Oh, that's right, they're having their reception in the town square.",
        "RORY: Yes, and Lindsay was out there holding a giant picture of her with Dean, and. . .",
        "LANE: Oh my God, did she see you?",
        "RORY: I don't think so. I do a pretty good idiot run when I need to.",
        "LANE: I'm sorry, I meant to tell you. I just didn't know you were coming home this weekend. It totally slipped my mind. Things have been so crazy. I just figured I'd tell you when we talked, and then we didn't, and. . .oh, I'm sorry, can you hold on for a sec?",
        "[She opens an armoire. Zach and Brian are inside]",
        "ZACH: Not cool, Lane.",
        "LANE: I'm sorry, guys.",
        "BRIAN: Fourth time today.",
        "LANE: Well, I thought Rory was my mom.",
        "ZACH: The resemblance is uncanny.",
        "BRIAN: We should get your mom a bell like a cat.",
        "RORY: What's going on?",
        "LANE: We're having a band meeting. We need to figure out what to do about a guitarist.",
        "BRIAN: I think I got a splinter.",
        "ZACH: You know that a splinter can get into your bloodstream, go straight to your heart, and kill you.",
        "BRIAN: Why would you tell me that?",
        "ZACH: Whatever, dude. This is lame. I'm gonna bail.",
        "LANE: Zach, come on.",
        "BRIAN: We need to find a guitarist.",
        "LANE: That's right. We have come too far to let the band fall apart just because Dave -",
        "ZACH: Hey, do not say the \"d\" word, Lane.",
        "LANE: But -",
        "ZACH: Don't.",
        "LANE: Dave -",
        "ZACH: Dave is dead to me. Comprendo? Dead. Cover the mirror, rip a shirt, that guy doesn't exist.",
        "BRIAN: He just went to college, Zach.",
        "ZACH: No, he did not just go to college. He walked out on his art, man. He walked out on his sound. Do you think a sound is so easy to find? Did you ever see that Glenn Miller movie? For two hours, Jimmy Stewart's walking around, \"I gotta find a sound. I gotta find a sound.\" Well, we had a sound and Dave took that sound to freaking California. You don't come back from California, man. It changes you.",
        "LANE: What did you expect him to do - not go to college?",
        "ZACH: No true rock 'n' roller goes to college!",
        "RORY: Mick Jagger went to the London School of Economics.",
        "ZACH: What?",
        "RORY: Yeah, and, uh, Dexter Holland of The Offspring got his PhD in molecular biology at USC. Greg Ginn of Black Flag graduated from UCLA. The guy from Bad Religion got his masters in geology from UCLA, and he's working on his PhD in evolutionary biology at Cornell.",
        "ZACH: Lane, she's your friend.",
        "RORY: I'm sorry. Um, I'm going. I'll call you later.",
        "LANE: Hey, are you mad?",
        "RORY: No, I'm not, I promise. I'm just - I'm just a little surprised. I mean, Dean's wedding. . .",
        "LANE: I know.",
        "RORY: But it's okay. It just means that I have to be a little more careful about where I go this weekend, that's all.",
        "LANE: Okay, well, I'll see you tomorrow. We're using the garage - guitar auditions.",
        "RORY: Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.",
        "ZACH: Shut up, shut up, shut up. Weezer did not go to Harvard.",
        "BRIAN: Not the whole band, just the lead -",
        "ZACH: Get away from me! I mean it.",
        "RORY: Bye.",
        "LANE: Bye.",
        "[Rory leaves. She sees Dean out front on the sidewalk]",
        "RORY: Hi.",
        "DEAN: Hi. Uh, were you. . .",
        "RORY: Oh, I was at, uh, Lane's.",
        "DEAN: Right, Lane's. Um.",
        "RORY: Um.",
        "DEAN: So, you're home this weekend.",
        "RORY: Yeah, I, uh, I ran out of clean clothes and quarters, so. . .how are things?",
        "DEAN: Good. You?",
        "RORY: Good.",
        "DEAN: You like Yale?",
        "RORY: I love Yale.",
        "DEAN: I figured.",
        "RORY: And Connecticut State?",
        "DEAN: It's. . .it's good.",
        "RORY: Oh, good. I'm glad it's good. I mean, not that I would have had any recourse if it wasn't, but, uh, this makes my lack of recourse a lot easier to deal with. So, I see you've taken over the town.",
        "DEAN: Oh, yeah. Uh, well, Lindsay thought. . .she likes the gazebo, and. . .",
        "RORY: And it's her wedding.",
        "DEAN: It is her wedding.",
        "RORY: And your wedding. I mean, it's your wedding, too.",
        "DEAN: Yes, it is. It's my wedding, too.",
        "RORY: Well, it's nice. It's, um, it's pretty. It looks like heaven or a Victoria's Secret commercial, which, to some people is basically the same thing.",
        "DEAN: I didn't know you'd be home this weekend.",
        "RORY: It was just a spur-of-the-moment thing.",
        "DEAN: Because if I had known, I would have, you know, invited you.",
        "RORY: Oh. Oh, well, it's. . .",
        "DEAN: I mean, I didn't want you to think I was just not inviting you.",
        "RORY: No, I didn't think that.",
        "DEAN: I just figured you'd be at school.",
        "RORY: 'Cause you're logical.",
        "DEAN: I just didn't know.",
        "RORY: No, I know you didn't know.",
        "DEAN: I didn't want you to think -",
        "RORY: No, I didn't think. I don't think. I go to Yale now. They think for you.",
        "DEAN: But, hey, since you are here, come.",
        "RORY: Come?",
        "DEAN: To my wedding. Come to my wedding.",
        "RORY: Oh, Dean. . .",
        "DEAN: You and Lorelai, I want you to.",
        "RORY: Well. . .",
        "DEAN: Chicken or beef?",
        "RORY: What?",
        "DEAN: Wait, beef. Of course, beef. I mean, the two of you are definitely beef. I mean, not like you resemble beef or anything.",
        "RORY: You know, you don't even have to -",
        "DEAN: Okay, so, noon at the church. I'll be the one in the tux. And don't worry, we didn't write our own vows and no one's singing opera. I know you think that's lame.",
        "RORY: Oh, no, well, it's a wedding. It's supposed to be. . .operatic.",
        "DEAN: Okay, so, I better get over there. Lindsay's expecting me. Uh, so, I'll just see you two tomorrow.",
        "RORY: But. . .",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "[Lorelai is in the living room staring at the alarm system control pad]",
        "KIRK: [calls from upstairs] Now?",
        "LORELAI: Nothing.",
        "KIRK: What about now?",
        "LORELAI: No, nothing.",
        "KIRK: Okay. Now?",
        "LORELAI: Nothing. Kirk, what's supposed to happen?",
        "KIRK: What?",
        "LORELAI: I don't know what I'm supposed to be looking for. Kirk?",
        "KIRK: I'm not sure.",
        "LORELAI: Kirk, please come downstairs.",
        "KIRK: Are you going to hurt me?",
        "LORELAI: Kirk.",
        "KIRK: [walking downstairs] I swear, they told me it would be self-explanatory. I just had to get in the main box, and in seconds, this thing would be disabled. They didn't tell me that I needed a key or that if I didn't have a key, that I would be mildly electrocuted, and then, after all that, when I got in the box, there's nothing self-explanatory about it.",
        "LORELAI: Kirk.",
        "KIRK: I was trying to do a nice thing.",
        "LORELAI: I know.",
        "KIRK: And Jimmy said he would install it for me because I do not have those skills yet. The class was full by the time I got there.",
        "LORELAI: That's okay.",
        "KIRK: Damn my constant tardiness.",
        "LORELAI: Kirk, please, what can we do right now? The alarm is just so loud.",
        "KIRK: Yeah, that's my fault, too. I asked Jimmy to really crank it up.",
        "LORELAI: Well, he did.",
        "KIRK: If you're gonna have an alarm, you need it loud. You don't want some crazed, knife-wielding gunman at your throat and the neighbors are going, like, \"Is that a fan? Did I leave the water running?\" You want them to know, \"Hey, that's an alarm.\"",
        "LORELAI: Your imaginary attacker has a knife and a gun?",
        "KIRK: And a really dirty tank top.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. So, uh, Jimmy's out of town, but until he gets back, we can. . .",
        "KIRK: Change the code.",
        "LORELAI: Really? To something I know?",
        "KIRK: You can pick it.",
        "LORELAI: You know how to do that?",
        "KIRK: Yes, I do.",
        "LORELAI: That is perfect.",
        "KIRK: Okay, here we go. Just punch in a 7-number sequence.",
        "LORELAI: You got it.",
        "[Sookie walks in]",
        "SOOKIE: Hey.",
        "LORELAI: Hi.",
        "SOOKIE: Did you know your phone's not working?",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "SOOKIE: I've been calling you for an hour. I had the operator check it. She said it's cut off or something.",
        "LORELAI: It was working this morning.",
        "KIRK: I'll be right back.",
        "LORELAI: Kirk!",
        "KIRK: I have tape. [goes upstairs]",
        "SOOKIE: You look tired.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, well, Kirk.",
        "SOOKIE: Right. Hey, listen, I got a call today.",
        "LORELAI: From?",
        "SOOKIE: Michel. A very upset Michel.",
        "LORELAI: Why?",
        "SOOKIE: Well, apparently, he called you and you never called him back.",
        "LORELAI: When did he call me?",
        "SOOKIE: He said he called you in July.",
        "LORELAI: I was in Europe in July.",
        "SOOKIE: I think that he thinks we're trying to ease him out of the Dragonfly.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, come on. Why would he think that?",
        "SOOKIE: I don't know, but he was so hysterical that his voice got into that high-pitched squeal he does, and all I could make out was \"fire\" and \"abandon me\" and something about not receiving a thank-you card for the Statue of Liberty.",
        "LORELAI: That is crazy. He knows we always intended to take him with us. I mean, we love Michel, right?",
        "SOOKIE: Right. He's the best concierge in the world.",
        "LORELAI: Absolutely. A little abrasive.",
        "SOOKIE: Kind of impatient.",
        "LORELAI: But charming.",
        "SOOKIE: And great at what he does, knows the community.",
        "LORELAI: Willing to go that extra mile.",
        "SOOKIE: Tiny bit obnoxious.",
        "LORELAI: Makes you want to scream, \"life's too short!\" two, three times a day, but. . .",
        "SOOKIE: Picture life without him. We do need him, right?",
        "LORELAI: Let's just go down there and talk to him.",
        "SOOKIE: Right.",
        "CUT TO FANCY HOTEL",
        "[Lorelai and Sookie walk in]",
        "LORELAI: Well, we know where all those Calvin Klein ads went to die.",
        "SOOKIE: They look like they all had the same mother.",
        "LORELAI: That must be one tired supermodel.",
        "[a woman walks by]",
        "LORELAI: Excuse me, we're look-",
        "[the woman ignores her and keeps walking]",
        "LORELAI: I wouldn't talk to us either.",
        "SOOKIE: Hey, talk to a boy. A boy will be nice to you.",
        "LORELAI: Okay.",
        "[they walk up to the front desk]",
        "LORELAI: Hi. Excuse me, we're looking for Michel Gerard.",
        "CONCIERGE: The corner of Mercer and Broom.",
        "LORELAI: Excuse me?",
        "[the man points to his headset]",
        "LORELAI: Oh, Janet Jackson's on the phone.",
        "SOOKIE: Oh.",
        "CONCIERGE: Uh huh, no worries. Hi.",
        "SOOKIE: Us?",
        "CONCIERGE: Yes.",
        "LORELAI: Oh.",
        "SOOKIE: We're looking for Michel Gerard.",
        "CONCIERGE: Michel.",
        "SOOKIE: Yes, Michel Ger. . . Janet again.",
        "LORELAI: She's very needy lately.",
        "CONCIERGE: You have some guests at the front desk. Uh-huh. No worries. He comes like the wind.",
        "LORELAI: Thanks. He doesn't need our thanks.",

        "LORELAI: How are you?",
        "MICHEL: Me? I am wonderful, and yourselves?",
        "LORELAI: We're great, and we're breaking ground on the inn on Monday.",
        "MICHEL: Oh, yes. Is that still happening?",
        "LORELAI: It is still happening.",
        "MICHEL: Well, that's lovely. There's a small charge for the use of the internet. All instructions are in the minibar. I'm so pleased.",

        "MICHEL: What call?",
        "SOOKIE: The call you made to me yesterday, the one where you told me that you called Lorelai and she didn't call back.",
        "MICHEL: I make so many calls.",
        "SOOKIE: The one where you cried.",
        "MICHEL: Are you sure it wasn't another Michel?",
        "SOOKIE: You called me! You kept me on the phone for over an hour. I missed the beginning of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, and by the time I got back, they were all gay.",

        "MICHEL: Yes, this place is impressive, isn't it? I mean, the uniform alone - like working in your jammies. And these headsets, are they not fabulous? Especially when, for example, you're in the bathroom, a place one would normally choose to be alone, then suddenly, bang, someone is yakking in your ear. How delightful. You can never get lonely.",

        "LORELAI: So, he was nervous.",
        "RORY: Well, we were both nervous. I mean, we didn't expect to run into each other, and I think he probably just invited us 'cause he felt like he had to, to be nice.",
