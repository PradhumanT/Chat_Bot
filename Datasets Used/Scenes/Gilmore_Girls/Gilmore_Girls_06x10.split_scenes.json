        "LORELAI'S HOUSE - BEDROOM",
        "[Lorelai dressed and sitting on the new bed, not the furniture Luke had in storage. She is putting her boots. She is tilting her head to listening for something or someone.]",
        "LORELAI: Hey.",
        "RORY [OS from the bathroom]: What?",
        "LORELAI: Make an occasional noise so I know you didn't pull an Elvis.",
        "RORY [OS]: Just putting the finishing touches on the face.",
        "LORELAI [snorts]: You're an infant. Hit yourself with a giant powder puff and get out here.",
        "RORY [OS]: I love this bathroom.",
        "LORELAI: Uh, too much! I need the sink.",
        "RORY [OS]: You need my sink? What about the other sink?",
        "LORELAI [gets up and walks to the bathroom door]: Oh! I forgot I had two sinks!",
        "RORY: Well, you do.",
        "LORELAI: Look at this. Two sinks. I'm so decadent. I could brush my teeth over this one and spit into that one.",
        "RORY: This is now my official favourite room in the whole world. Besides the Reading Room at the British Museum. But add a dome ceiling and ten million books and you've got yourself a horse race.",
        "LORELAI: Paul Anka loves this room too.",
        "RORY [laughs]: You ever hear that tape of him chewing out his band after a show? 'When I move, I slice like a hammer! The guys get shirts!'",
        "LORELAI: That's the human Paul Anka.",
        "RORY: I don't believe the canine version exists.",
        "LORELAI: He is just laying low until he figures out you're not going to break his heart or eat his pig's ears or something.",
        "RORY: Well, the chicken's got to show his face so I can prove myself.",
        "LORELAI: So, what all do you have going on today? Oh, she's already got a list going.",
        "RORY [reading]: Follow up calls to Yale to make sure I'm all set up for spring semester, four hours of community service - I'm going to try to stretch it to five because I am tantalizingly close to being done - my engine light was on, but I already took care of that -",
        "LORELAI: This morning?",
        "RORY [noding]: Got to Gypsy's shop before it opened. There was only one other annoying early bird ahead of me, but I bribed Gypsy with a pack of Rolo's and she took me first.",
        "LORELAI: She is such a Rolo whore.",
        "RORY: I've got tons of e-mails to return, and, oh, I've got to get the Eagle-Gazette a bunch of stuff I've written.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. Don't forget to sleep, daughter of mine.",
        "RORY: Eh. And, uh, I've got to unpack and organize everything and that's it, for now.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, but you will have to leave the bathroom to do all that.",
        "RORY: Mm, reluctantly. See you downstairs.[She goes out the room.] LORELAI [calling after her as she goes down stairs]: Okay. Hey, you have time to eat and hang out with me, don't you? Is that on your microscopic little list there?",
        "RORY [OS]: I've timed out the rest of the morning for you.",
        "LORELAI: Good girl!",
        "RORY [OS, shocked]: Oh! Oh, my God!",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "RORY [OS]: Come down here!",
        "LORELAI: I'm coming!",
        "LIVING ROOM",
        "[Lorelai comes down to meet Rory on the stairs, she is stunned to see Paul Anka sitting on the coffee table.]",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "RORY: He has emerged. I'm assuming that's Paul Anka.",
        "LORELAI: Well, it ain't Louis Prima.",
        "RORY: Shoo! Shoo!",
        "LORELAI: What are you doing?",
        "RORY: He shouldn't be on the table.",
        "LORELAI: That's his favorite spot. What are you going to do next, tell him he can't drink out of my water glass?",
        "RORY: Sorry. How should I approach him?",
        "LORELAI: Follow me.",
        "RORY: 'Kay.[They slowly go down the stairs.]",
        "LORELAI: Okay, stop. Now go in the kitchen and put sugar on your toes.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: And quickly! Because first impressions are crucial and you're blowing it big time.",
        "RORY: Sugar on my toes?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, he loves sugar, so the first time you come close to him, if you've got sugar on your toes that he can lick and enjoy, you're in.",
        "RORY: He's going to lick it?",
        "LORELAI: Go, quick!",
        "RORY: Okay. [Running to the kitchen, stops at the sink and takes off her shoes.]",
        "LORELAI [OS]: Wet your toes first so it sticks!",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI [OS]: Dry sugar on a dry toe isn't going to work!",
        "RORY: Oh, jeez. [Turns on the tap and moistens a paper towel to wet her foot, then tips sugar on it, spilling some on the floor.] I'm making a mess.",
        "LORELAI [OS]: Don't worry about the mess!",
        "RORY: We're going to have ants!",
        "LORELAI [OS]: Hurry!",
        "RORY: I'm coming!",
        "[Quickly walking back to the living room. Lorelai is now sitting on the coffee table next to Paul Anka.]",
        "RORY: Okay, my toes are all sugared.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, good! Now do the hokey-pokey and turn yourself around.",
        "RORY [wary]: What?",
        "LORELAI: All you have to do is pet him and you're in!",
        "RORY: You're evil.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, I am.",
        "[Paul Anka hops of the coffee table and licks Rory's toes.]",
        "RORY [petting him]: Hey, there, boy! Oh, that tickles!",
        "LORELAI: Well, he's glad you're here! Wait a minute, you're here!",
        "RORY: I know!",
        "LORELAI: Wait right there.",
        "[Lorelai goes into the hall closet.]",
        "RORY: Is this another trick?",
        "LORELAI: No, I'm just getting something. [The \"Bop-it\" toy makes a noise.]",
        "RORY: You're pulling out the Bop-it? You're already that bored of me?",
        "LORELAI [returns with a hat box]: No. I just accidentally hit the Bop-it while I was getting this.",
        "RORY: You bought me a hat?",
        "LORELAI: No, it's a hat box, filled with these. [Opening it she and gets out some bits of paper.] These are notes, written on whatever I had on hand at the time. Any time I had a topic I wanted to share with you or a random thought during that crappy time apart of ours, I jotted it down and threw it in the hat box so I wouldn't forget.",
        "RORY: Really?",
        "LORELAI: I missed you, kid.",
        "RORY: Missed you too. [Smiling at each other.] So, hit me with 'em!",
        "LORELAI: While we walk to Luke's. Come on. Some of these are pretty cryptic. [Reading]: Um, Lenny Kravitz - where did Lenny Kravitz -",
        "RORY and LORELAI [together]: Get all his money?",
        "LORELAI: Yes! One hit and he's buying a Fifth Avenue mansion.",
        "RORY: Maybe he went through Nicole Kidman's wallet when she wasn't looking.",
        "LORELAI: That's got to be it. [Reading another bit of paper] Computer MP down - oh. I want to download music. There's so much out there. Can you help me figure that out? MP3 players?",
        "RORY: I can do that. Next?",
        "LORELAI: Eh, Kirk skeet shooting.",
        "RORY: That's a bad combination.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, it's the first time the town church has taken gunfire since the eighteenth century.",
        "RORY: I missed so much so quickly!",
        "[They leave.]",
        "OPENING CREDITS",
        "TOWN SQUARE",
        "[Lorelai and Rory are walking through town, across a street, heading to Luke's, reading more the notes.]",
        "LORELAI: Okay. Babette - cats.",
        "RORY: Death?",
        "LORELAI: No.",
        "RORY: Adopted another one?",
        "LORELAI: No.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: Recorded their meows, did some editing and cut a record of them singing Ring of Fire.",
        "RORY: Well, that goes straight to the top of my charts.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, I started reading Beowulf, that new translation you recommended.",
        "RORY: The Seamus Heaney? Good for you.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah. And stopped reading Beowulf, jotted on the same slip three minutes later.",
        "RORY: Well, you gave it the old college try.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, this is a new one! Kirk's got a new hobby. He's doing -",
        "RORY [together]: Doing Tai Chi?",
        "LORELAI: How'd you know that?",
        "RORY: Because he's doing it right there.",
        "[Rory points to Kirk, doing Tai Chi on the lawn.]",
        "LORELAI: Is it possible for him to do something without looking a little silly?",
        "RORY: He wouldn't be Kirk then.",
        "LORELAI [reading]: Bendleshnitz? [She shrugs.]",
        "RORY: That's not English.",
        "LORELAI: I know. I'll add it to the ones that I can't make out. And - [reading another] - brazzlefrat.",
        "RORY: Another unreadable one.",
        "LORELAI: They're stacking up! [As they reach Luke's, Lorelai takes Rory's hand.] Okay. Now wait out here.",
        "RORY: Why?",
        "LORELAI: It's a thing. A moment thing. Just wait here.",
        "RORY: Okay.",
        "[Lorelai enters.]",
        "LUKE: Hey!",
        "LORELAI: You ready?",
        "LUKE: For what?",
        "LORELAI: For this! The moment you've all been waiting for! [She vibrates her tongue.] Brrrr!",
        "LUKE: What's that?",
        "LORELAI: It's a drum roll.",
        "LUKE: It sounded more like a helicopter.",
        "LORELAI: Well, it's a drum roll, go with it, okay? [Luke murmurs his agreement.] Ladies and gentlemen, Rory Gilmore! [She opens the door.]",
        "RORY [entering]: Hi Luke!",
        "LUKE: Hey, Rory, you're back! [They hug, awkwardly.]",
        "RORY: I'm back!",
        "LUKE: Good! You look good. You look healthy, happy. Huh, here with your mom, both of you here. Yeah, it's great, you know! Yay! [Awkward pause.] I don't think I've ever said 'yay' before. Sounded weird.",
        "LORELAI: A little.",
        "LUKE: Come, sit, sit.",
        "[They sit down.]",
        "RORY: What was that sound you were making?",
        "LORELAI: A drum roll!",
        "RORY: It sounded like a helicopter or something.",
        "LUKE: That's what I said.",
        "LORELAI: Has no one heard a drum roll before?",
        "LUKE: Hey, I saved you the best table in case you showed up.",
        "RORY: In case? It was mandatory.",
        "LUKE: What can I get you? Ah, never mind. I'm going to bring you everything you like. I know what you like.",
        "RORY: Sounds good.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, hey! You were with me when I wrote this. [Holding up a notes.] Uh, what does it say?",
        "LUKE [takes the note]: Oh, this is from that stupid Mexican restaurant we went to.",
        "LORELAI: Right. I wrote something on the other side.",
        "LUKE: Man, this place stunk!",
        "LORELAI: I know, but read the back, there. I've got to know what it says.",
        "LUKE: Look what we paid! Unbelievable.",
        "LORELAI: Downright usurious! Now look at the other side, there. The brazzelfrat?",
        "LUKE: They did charge me for that second beer! I never got it.",
        "LORELAI: Scandalous. But the other side.",
        "LUKE: Six bucks for guacamole.",
        "LORELAI [takes the paper back]: Oh, just bring me what she's having.",
        "LUKE: Coming right up. [He turns to leave.]",
        "RORY: So, Luke, wait! You haven't told me anything about yourself. What's new with you?",
        "LUKE: With me? Uh, nothing. We're engaged, your mom and me.",
        "RORY: I know that, but anything else?",
        "LUKE: No. No, why?",
        "RORY: Just wondering.",
        "LUKE: What have you heard?",
        "RORY: Nothing. That's why I'm asking.",
        "LUKE: Well, there's your answer. Nothing. Nothing's new. [Nods.] I'm going to go put in your order, okay?",
        "RORY: Sure.",
        "[He leaves.]",
        "LORELAI: We'll be waiting hungrily!",
        "RORY: Did I inadvertently step into something there?",
        "LORELAI: No idea.",
        "[Lane comes to the table.]",
        "LANE: Mother and daughter, together again, and all is right with the world. Hi, Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: Hi, Lane.",
        "LANE [to Rory]: So. Next Wednesday night, I need you. Tell me you're not busy.",
        "RORY: I'm not sure, why?",
        "LANE: We're doing a showcase. Me and the band. Not a gig, a showcase. And a label's going to be there. [Lorelai eagerly gasps.] I'm shaking! I shouldn't shake, I'm a drummer! It'll mess up the beat. But, my God, we're playing for a label.",
        "RORY: Wow! Lane, I'm absolutely there. This is big!",
        "LANE: Very big. Unless it's a 'Waiting for Guffman' thing and the label guys don't show up. Did I just jinx it?",
        "RORY: I don't know. Let's do that un-jinxing thing we used to do, just in case.",
        "LANE: Good.",
        "[They link pinkie fingers.]",
        "RORY and LANE [solemnly, together]: Jinx back, double pinkie, round the side, double pinkie, jinx back. [Clapping their hands twice together.]",
        "LORELAI: Hey, I want to do that!",
        "RORY: It's a serious thing, Mom! You don't just do it.",
        "LORELAI: Sorry.",
        "RORY: Well, Lane, you guys are so prepared for this. That tape you gave me of your new stuff was awesome!",
        "LORELAI: Hey, what if I jinx it! Do I get to do the un-jinxing thing then?",
        "LANE: If we jinx-back a second time within the hour, it cancels out the first jinx-back.",
        "LORELAI: Sorry.",
        "LANE: So, what were your favorites on the tape?",
        "RORY: Well, 'Melissa' was catchy, and 'Colleen Francine'. But that other one - 'Rebecca in the morning'? That was my favorite.",
        "LANE: Mine too!",
        "RORY: Zach's into songs with girl's names, huh?",
        "LANE: He thinks that's our best shot at radio play. Worked for the Police, the Knack, Franz Ferdinand.",
        "RORY: Good thinking.",
        "LANE: Hey. Do you want to be our DA Pennebaker? We're borrowing a video camera, and we need someone sober to do the photography.",
        "RORY: I could set my crack pipe aside for the night and do that.",
        "LANE: Thanks! [Taking out her notepad.] You plus one, right?",
        "RORY: Plus one?",
        "LANE: You plus Logan?",
        "RORY: No. Just me.",
        "[Lorelai looks concerned.]",
        "LANE: Oh, okay. How about you, Lorelai?",
        "LORELAI: Working that night, sweetie, but break a leg. Does that get me a hand thingy?",
        "RORY: No.",
        "LORELAI: Rats.",
        "LANE: See you guys.",
        "[She leaves.]",
        "LORELAI: So, just you, huh?",
        "RORY: Just me.",
        "LORELAI: Okay!",
        "RORY: As long as you're prying -",
        "LORELAI: I wasn't.",
        "RORY: Briefly, succinctly, Logan and I are not talking right now.",
        "LORELAI: Ah.",
        "RORY: We had a fight. A big one, in public.",
        "LORELAI: Oops.",
        "RORY: I think we just needed a little break, a least I did. It's more like a hiatus.",
        "LORELAI: Well, sometimes a break is good.",
        "RORY: Sometimes.",
        "[Luke brings them their food.]",
        "LUKE: Food. First wave only. Second wave, five minutes.",
        "RORY: Let's dig in.",
        "LORELAI [eagerly]: I hope it's not cold. Oops, I think I jinxed it!",
        "[She holds up her hand and Rory plays along.]",
        "RORY and LORELAI [together]: Jinx back, double pinkie, round the side, double pinkie, jinx back.",
        "LORELAI: Woo!",
        "DRAGONFLY INN - KITCHEN",
        "[The kitchen is busy with staff and Sookie cooking.]",
        "SOOKIE: Okay, where's the onions for my sauce? Who's my onion man?",
        "CARL: Right here, Sookie.",
        "SOOKIE: Okay, right here, Carl. I need them right there. Okay? Get the shallots in it. It's time. It's time! [She tastes a sauce.] Okay. Needs more garlic. Come on. Godfather it up for me. [To the woman chopping herbs] Good! Good, good, good. Good, good. Okay. If you can travel back in time and make me not make the veal and ham pate, I'd appreciate it. Talk me out of these things in the future, guys.",
        "LORELAI [comes up behind her]: Hello!",
        "SOOKIE: Hello!",
        "LORELAI: Could you step away from the pan, please?",
        "SOOKIE: Honey, do you see a joystick? This is not a game. Okay? It's a heche sauce and it's for keeps!",
        "LORELAI: Put it down!",
        "SOOKIE [turns to Lorelai]: Okay! What?",
        "LORELAI [calling]: Okay!",
        "[Rory comes in, Sookie shrieks in excitement throwing her hands in the air. They hit Carl in the face, knocking him over, a bowl of food is knocked to the floor.]",
        "SOOKIE [hugs Rory]: Oh, my God!",
        "RORY: Hi Sookie!",
        "SOOKIE: You're here! You're with us! Oh, look, I missed you!",
        "RORY: I missed you!",
        "SOOKIE [gasps, to Lorelai]: This means you can set a wedding date. No impediments!",
        "LORELAI: Yeah. I already told Luke.",
        "SOOKIE [breathless]: Hyperventilating! [She gives a thumbs-up signal to Rory and Lorelai how look worried.] Hyperventilating! I was just working on my list of what to make for Thanksgiving and I was wishing you were going to be here and now you are! [Still gasping] Oh my God! What if what I'm wishing for is actually coming true?",
        "LORELAI: Quick! Wish for a Sephora to be built within walking distance.",
        "RORY: Do you need a paper bag?",
        "SOOKIE: I'm good, I'm good. Just happy. [She sighs. Michel enters.]",
        "MICHEL [smiles cheerfully]: Rory!",
        "RORY [amazed]: Oh, hi! Wow, Michel.",
        "MICHEL [back to serious voice]: Hi.",
        "LORELAI: Boy, that was weird.",
        "MICHEL: She just surprised me, that's all. [To Rory] It's kind of okay that you are here.",
        "RORY: It's kind of okay with me too.",
        "SOOKIE [shouting suddenly]: Lunch!",
        "RORY: What?",
        "SOOKIE [points at Rory forcefully]: Lunch! I'm making you lunch!",
        "RORY: But we just -",
        "LORELAI: Don't fight it.",
        "SOOKIE: It just came to me. Kebabs. Okay, drop everything, boys! We're making kebabs for Rory, and pot stickers! Okay, throw everything out. This is a celebration! Woo!",
        "LORELAI: Let's get to higher ground.",
        "[Rory and Lorelai turn to leave the kitchen.]",
        "LANE'S HOUSE",
        "[Band meeting.]",
        "ZACH: Okay, we're opening with Melissa, closing with Dear Maureen. Those are great bookends, it's the middle part that's screwing us up.",
        "GIL: Aw, man, I wish we had one more ballad.",
        "ZACH: I'm half finished with one, but it's not going to be ready in time. [Singing] I saw her, in the mist she came walking by, Stella. Now a blur, made a list of what I like about her, Stella.",
        "BRIAN: Cool!",
        "GIL: Yeah! It's got a nice Fountains of Wayne meets the Shins crossed with Odyssey-era Zombies, and a mix of early Who and mid-to-late-era Replacements vibe to it.",
        "ZACH: Well, that's what I was going for. Still hunting for that middle eight, you know?",
        "LANE: So, um, it's called Stella?",
        "ZACH: Yeah, I guess. Didn't you like it?",
        "LANE: No, it's good. It's just - it's another girl's name.",
        "ZACH: So?",
        "GIL: If he were singing about dudes, I'd be out the door before you could say 'See ya'!",
        "ZACH: Look, Lane, you know how I write. I think about people that I've known and I draw inspiration from that.",
        "LANE: I know, it's just, no big deal or anything, but have you ever thought to write one about, I don't know, a girl named Lane?",
        "ZACH: Well, Lane just isn't that great of a name for a song.",
        "LANE: But you've already got one called Lorraine. Lorraine is pretty much Lane with an extra syllable thrown in.",
        "ZACH: True, but nothing rhymes with Lane.",
        "LANE: I'm sorry, but a million things rhyme with Lane.",
        "ZACH: Yeah, rain. Pain. All clich\u00e9 stuff. You're not a writer.",
        "BRIAN: I think you could come up with non-clich\u00e9 stuff to rhyme with Lane.",
        "ZACH: Wait, maybe I could write one about your Korean name. What was that again?",
        "LANE: Hyung-hyung?",
        "Zach [cringes]: O for two. Look, it's not your fault. You didn't pick your name, your mom did.",
        "LANE: Right. I didn't pick it.",
        "ZACH: Okay, so. Where were we? Oh. Lorraine. Where should Lorraine go?",
        "GIL: Try it after Rebecca.",
        "BRIAN: It's not as good a transition as going from Rebecca to Linda Marie.",
