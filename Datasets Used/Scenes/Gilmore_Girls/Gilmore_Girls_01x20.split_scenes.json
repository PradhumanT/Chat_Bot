        "(Lorelai and Rory are sitting at a table. Lorelai is in the middle of telling a story.)",
        "LORELAI: So then he starts ripping my twenty dollar bill into like a million pieces. And I'm thinking to myself, there is a store full of people, why am I the one on line with the crazy magician? (Rory yawns) Okay, I'll cut to the end. So he couldn't put it back together again and he had to pay me back in quarters.",
        "RORY: Very good story.",
        "LORELAI: You look tired.",
        "RORY: I just haven't been sleeping very well lately.",
        "LORELAI: How come?",
        "RORY: Just have a lot on my mind.",
        "L: Anything I can do?",
        "R: Flag down the coffee.",

        "R: And one.",
        "(Older man walks by.)",
        "L: Pass.",
        "R: Why?",

        "R: She's already passed up two perfectly good prospects.",
        "L: But I'm feeling pretty good about number three.",
        "LUKE: Do I want to know what you're doing?",
        "R: Hey, Luke came to the table, does that make him number three?",
        "LUKE: No.",
        "L: You don't even know what we're doing.",
        "LUKE: The safest answer in anything involving the two of you is no.",
        "L: We're playing one, two, three, he's yours.",
        "LUKE: I didn't ask.",
        "R: You can take the first guy that walks by, or if you decide to pass, assuming there's somebody better out there, you can take the next guy that walks by, or if you don't take him, you're automatically stuck with the third guy.",
        "L: Got it?",
        "LUKE: I'm not playing.",
        "L: Well of course not. Its still my turn.",
        "R: Okay, guy number 3 is crossing the street right now.",
        "(All three of them stare out the window.)",
        "LUKE: Why am I looking?",
        "L: Because it's like a train wreck.",
        "(They see Kirk walking towards the diner.)",
        "L: Aww, no!",
        "R: Daddy!",
        "L: Not Kirk!",

        "KIRK: It wasn't funny last week and it's not funny now! I have asthma.",
        "(Kirk leaves the diner.)",
        "R: Mom, quick he's leaving!",
        "L: Oh no, Kirk come back, I love you! Drat. All right, your turn.",
        "R: I don't know Mom. You already got Kirk, how's a girl to top that?",
        "L: You're right, he's yours.",
        "R: And one.",
        "(They stare out the window. Dean walks by. Rory gets a sad look on her face.)",

        "MICHEL: I'm sorry, she's busy, how may I assist you?",
        "MAX: Actually, I need to speak to Ms. Gilmore.",
        "MICHEL: Is this business or personal?",
        "MAX: Personal.",

        "MAX: Is anybody there? Hello?",
        "L: Yes, Hello, hi.",
        "MAX: Lorelai?",
        "L: Max!",

        "MAX: So. .",
        "L: Ooh, hey, make a gorilla sound.",

        "MAX: I am not making a gorilla sound.",
        "L: I'll tell you what color underwear I'm wearing. (pause) Had you considering the gorilla sound, didn't I?",
        "MAX: Yup.",
        "L: I'm good.",
        "MAX: Okay, I need you to be serious now.",
        "L: Says the man with no pants.",
        "MAX: We've been having these very successful phone calls for a couple of weeks now.",
        "L: Yes we have.",
        "MAX: And I think that all the talking has done us a lot of good.",
        "L: Yes it has.",
        "MAX: So I was thinking that maybe this weekend instead of a phone call, we should have a date. Let's have dinner.",
        "L: Hmm, at the same restaurant?",
        "MAX: At the same table.",
        "L: Interesting idea.",
        "MAX: I think its time.",
        "L: You know what? So do I.",

        "R: Well, I'm not.",
        "LANE: Okay.",
        "R: Okay.",
        "LANE: I just thought you'd might like to know for future reference that Dean is not in the store on Wednesdays so you can mark it down on that little list you're hiding from me that says where Dean is so that you can avoid him at any time.",
        "R: I was not avoiding the market.",
        "LANE: Oh, my mistake.",
        "R: I wasn't.",
        "LANE: Okay. So what are you doing tonight?",
        "R: Well homework, and then homework, and if I get all that done in time, some homework. You?",

        "L: You had a couple things to pick up at the cat club?",
        "LUKE: Yeah I did, okay?",
        "L: Okay, I just never took you for a cat lover, a 97 year old woman, or. . . Hey what'd you buy?",
        "LUKE: Nothing.",
        "L: You've got a little bag there.",

        "LUKE: Yes.",
        "L: Little kitty pot holders. (she pushes a button that makes them meow.) They meow.",
        "LUKE: It's a present.",
        "L: For someone you hate?",
        "LUKE: It's Rachel's birthday okay. And don't say anything, she doesn't want anybody to know. She hates birthdays.",
        "L: Not as much as she's gonna hate these pot holders.",
        "LUKE: I don't know how to buy gifts, okay, I don't like to buy gifts. I don't like getting gifts. I mean, this whole give giving and getting process is completely insane.",
        "L: The rant begins!",
        "LUKE: I mean suddenly, on a certain date, the level of my affection for a person isn't measured by the way that I treat them or what we share.",
        "L: No!",
        "LUKE: I mean just because I didn't buy her furry slippers or a giant shoe tree, all of a sudden, I suck.",
        "L: Luke, stop. You know you cannot give her these pot holders.",
        "LUKE: Yeah I know.",
        "L: Why don't you go to the mall and walk around a little?",
        "LUKE: No, no malls.",
        "L: Luke.",
        "LUKE: I hate malls.",
        "L: Ladies and gentlemen, rant number two.",
        "LUKE: They underpay employees and overprice merchandise, they contribute to urban sprawl, they encourage materialism, and the parking's a horror. You drive in, you pay a buck, and even if you're only there for five. .",
        "L: Okay, Emma Goldman, I'll tell you what. I'll go for you.",
        "LUKE: You're gonna shop for me?",
        "L: I've got the day off tomorrow. I was gonna go anyway.",
        "LUKE: You're serious?",
        "L: I'll go get a bunch of stuff, all returnable. I'll bring it to you. You can pick what you want and the rest I'll return. I'll do all the work; all you'll have to do is point.",
        "LUKE: Point.",
        "L: One finger, preferably your index.",
        "LUKE: I don't know.",
        "L: Luke, this is the first special occasion you and Rachel have shared since she's been back. Don't you want to give her something nice?",
        "LUKE: Well I am taking her out to dinner.",
        "L: Luke.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, I gotta get her something nice.",
        "L: So then let me help.",
        "LUKE: All right, thank you.",
        "L: Oh, you're welcome.",
        "(Luke hands her his credit card.)",
        "LUKE: Nothing too out there, okay? She's not into all that trendy stuff. She likes simple, clean nature, okay. Elephants, candles, okay. Oh hey, if you can find a candle shaped like an elephant, that would . .",
        "L: Okay, you know what, I've got it all under control.",
        "LUKE: Okay, thanks.",

        "DEAN: So that's your mom?",
        "LANE: That's my mom.",
        "DEAN: Has she seen Patton?",
        "LANE: She just gets uptight about boys.",
        "DEAN: I sensed something like that.",

        "LANE: Out agreement not to talk about Rory.",
        "DEAN: We didn't have an agreement not to talk about Rory.",
        "LANE: Well it was an unspoken agreement.",
        "DEAN: Well it was really unspoken 'cause nobody spoke it.",
        "LANE: Well I just think that if we have to study together it would be better if we didn't discuss Rory.",
        "DEAN: Fine.",
        "LANE: Fine. (pause) You know, she can't go into the market.",
        "DEAN: Why not?",

        "(Rory is asleep in bed. Lorelai bangs on her door, then walks in and jumps on her bed.)",
        "L: Time to get up. Hey, I have a huge dilemma that I need your opinion on.",
        "R: What!",
        "L: Am I more beautiful today than I was yesterday?",
        "R: Oh boy.",
        "L: I'm just not sure. I mean at first I looked in the mirror and I thought, well yes, definitely, huge improvement.",
        "R: Can I have my pillow back?",
        "L: But then I thought maybe its not that I'm more beautiful today. Maybe I was just as beautiful yesterday, only I lacked the self-esteem to recognize it.",
        "R: I'm gonna go take a shower.",
        "L: Well, hurry up and I'll drive you to school.",
        "R: No thanks. (Gets out of bed and walks over to her bureau.)",
        "L: Why so charming this morning?",
        "R: I had an annoying visit from the Stars Hollow wake up fairy. Where's my tie?",
        "L: In your drawer.",
        "R: I'm looking in the drawer.",
        "L: Hmm. Check the living room",
        "R: Why would my tie be in the living room?",
        "L: Because it's been seeing the doily on the coffee table. I'm sorry, I did not want you to find out this way.",
        "R: Don't take this personally, but get out.",
        "L: Okay, you're crabby. Do you know what the perfect cure for crabbiness is? A fabulous trip to the mall. Huh? What do you say? You can blow off school and come with me. We can shop, go to the movies, maybe talk a little.",
        "R: No thanks.",
        "L: Come on, just this once. It might make you feel better.",
        "R: I feel fine and I don't want to shop.",
        "L: Honey, I know you've been in a funk over Dean, but you have to try not to dwell on it all the time.",
        "R: I'm gonna be late for school.",
        "L: Okay, then just meet me in town around four, and we'll get some Indian food and spoil our dinner. What do you say to that?",
        "R: Whatever.",
        "L: Hey, love the enthusiasm. Hey, does \"Up With People\" know about you?",
        "CUT TO LUKE'S DINER",
        "(Luke answers the phone and takes an order while Lorelai walks into the diner carrying several shopping bags.)",
        "LUKE: Luke's. Yeah. Hang on. Okay. Cheeseburger. Fries well. Vanilla shake. Coke. Yes we have salad. One salad with cheese, one with ranch. Got it, 20 minutes. (hangs up the phone) What the hell is this?",
        "L: The results of my shopping trip all accomplished in two hours.",
        "LUKE: Impossible.",
        "L: I'm a savant.",
        "LUKE: And everything's returnable.",
        "L: Yes, yes, now sit down and relax. Let me show you what I got.",
        "LUKE: Can I have my credit card back?",
        "L: Fine. (Takes the card out of her purse and hands it you Luke.)",
        "LUKE: Looks tired.",
        "L: Where's Rachel?",
        "LUKE: She's out running some errands.",
        "L: Good. Okay, last week we were talking about Meryl Streep and the whole accent thing and Rachel said that she loved \"Out of Africa\" but she'd never read the book, remember?",
        "LUKE: Nope.",
        "L: Okay, so I was like, \"Are you crazy? Isak Dinesen is amazing, I love her.\" Which is kind of crap because I'd never read the book either, but Rory told me it was amazing, so I felt pretty confident in my recommendation of \"Out of Africa\". (Pulls the book out of a shopping bag and hands it to Luke.)",
        "LUKE: You bought her a book?",
        "L: No, you bought her a book, to be put in her brand new camera bag. (Pulls the camera bag out of another shopping bag.)",
        "LUKE: She's got a camera bag.",
        "L: It's nylon.",
        "LUKE: So?",

        "R: Okay, can we pick a new hypothetical 'cause this one's wigging me out.",
        "L: My point is that it's scary to be in love, that much I know, but it's also wonderful and special and if you can't say it or fully express it then you're never gonna be able to experience it and I want you to experience everything that's great because you're so great. Are you hearing me?",
