        "[The maid opens the door for Lorelai and Rory]",
        "LORELAI: Hi.",
        "MAID: Good evening. May I take your coats?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, sure, thanks.",
        "EMILY: [from living room] That's the most absurd thing I've ever heard.",
        "MAID: Your mother's in the living room.",
        "LORELAI: So last chance to run, huh?",
        "MAID: Excuse me?",
        "RORY: Just ignore her.",
        "[They walk to the living room. Emily is talking on the phone and doesn't see them come in]",
        "EMILY: Of course I said it. Well, I can't imagine who would take jackbooted as a compliment. I will not apologize. Every time she went to the pantry, I thought she was marching on Poland. Oh, I see, because I want things a certain way, I'm unreasonable?",
        "[Lorelai pours herself a glass of wine]",
        "RORY: Shh!",
        "EMILY: Why, that is the most absurd. . .I want to see this document. Fax it to me immediately.",
        "LORELAI: Fax it to me immediately?",
        "RORY: She's part of the electronic age.",
        "EMILY: Tomorrow morning is completely unacceptable. It's unacceptable because I'm paying you three hundred dollars an hour. So turn that little near-luxury car around, go back to your office, and fax me that libelous scrap of paper.",
        "LORELAI: Ask him if he can pick up some ice cream, too.",
        "EMILY: Well, tell your wife to tape your daughter's recital. [hangs up] Unbelievable.",
        "[Emily turns around and sees Lorelai and Rory on the couch]",
        "LORELAI: Hi Mom.",
        "RORY: Hi Grandma.",
        "EMILY: When did you two get here?",
        "LORELAI: Sometime between the second absurd and the third unbelievable.",
        "EMILY: I apologize. That call caught me off guard.",
        "RORY: Is everything all right, Grandma?",
        "EMILY: Everything's fine.",
        "LORELAI: Are you sure?",
        "EMILY: I'm sure.",
        "LORELAI: You look peeved.",
        "EMILY: I'm not peeved.",
        "LORELAI: Well, you look peeved.",
        "EMILY: Kindly stop making me say the word peeved.",
        "LORELAI: Mom, spill it. What's wrong?",
        "EMILY: That was our lawyer calling to inform me that one of our former maids is suing for wrongful termination.",
        "LORELAI: Hm.",
        "EMILY: You might at least act surprised.",
        "LORELAI: It's not the first time, is it?",
        "EMILY: It most certainly is.",
        "LORELAI: Really?",
        "EMILY: Yes, Lorelai, really.",
        "LORELAI: Well, then, I'm surprised.",
        "EMILY: It's beyond surprising, it's outrageous.",
        "RORY: What did Grandpa say?",
        "EMILY: Your Grandfather's still in London helping his mother close down her house. Of course he'd be gone when this happens.",
        "LORELAI: I think he planned it that way.",
        "RORY: Which maid was it?",
        "EMILY: Gerta, the one from Hamburg, Germany.",
        "LORELAI: Which one was she?",
        "RORY: You remember \u0096 she was the one you made all those Hamburg/hamburger jokes to.",
        "LORELAI: God, I beat that dead horse.",
        "RORY: With glee.",
        "EMILY: She was the clomper.",
        "LORELAI: The clomper?",
        "EMILY: She'd be upstairs making the beds and it'd sound like a Munich beer hall rally.",
        "LORELAI: That's why you fired her?",
        "EMILY: Yes.",
        "LORELAI: Because she made noise when she walked?",
        "EMILY: Yes.",
        "LORELAI: Was she a good maid otherwise?",
        "EMILY: What?",
        "LORELAI: Besides the clomping, was she polite, on time, made sure the little fork went on the outside?",
        "EMILY: Have you been listening to me? She was not performing her duties as I wished them to be performed. Everything else is beside the point.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I guess it's always something, isn't it?",
        "EMILY: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "LORELAI: It means you always seem to find the one thing about a maid that negates all of her good qualities. I mean, at a certain point, isn't it just easier to let a couple things slide?",
        "EMILY: I see. So it's my fault?",
        "LORELAI: I didn't say that.",
        "EMILY: No, Lorelai, you did. For years, I've been listening to you and your father and everyone else go on and on about how demanding I am, how I have to have things a certain way. Well, guess what? I pay to have them that way. I pay more than anyone else pays their maids, and when things are not the way I want, that means I'm not getting what I paid for. Why is that so hard to understand?",
        "LORELAI: It isn't hard to understand, it's just \u0096",
        "EMILY: If you pay for first class and the airline sticks you in coach, people expect you to be upset. No one calls you demanding or unreasonable. And yet here is this woman whom I pay more than she can get anywhere else in Hartford, whose severance package could finance a summer cruise down the Rhine, dragging me into court saying that I was unfair. Why? Because having paid for one thing, I'm not content with something else? That makes me unfair? Well, then, so be it. Let someone else pay first class and ride in steerage, not me.",
        "MAID: Excuse me, Mrs. Gilmore, dinner's ready",
        "EMILY: Thank you, Brooke, we'll be right there.",
        "[Brooke walks away; Lorelai and Rory start to get up]",
        "EMILY: Wait, wait, wait. Do you hear that?",
        "LORELAI: Hear what?",
        "EMILY: Exactly.",
        "[opening credits]",
        "CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN",
        "[Lorelai is watching Sookie and Jackson argue]",
        "SOOKIE: You know, next time I want some grapefruit, I'm just gonna ask for a kazoo because you can only seem to get me the most bizarre opposite.",
        "JACKSON: What is your problem?",
        "[Michel walks in]",
        "MICHEL: I need you to \u0096",
        "LORELAI: Shh!",
        "MICHEL: What? Oh, it started. You were supposed to call me.",
        "LORELAI: Stop talking.",
        "JACKSON: I understand perfectly. You wanna be a dictator.",
        "SOOKIE: Oh, come off it.",
        "JACKSON: Commandant St. James says, \"Brussels sprouts! You will bring me the Brussels sprouts.\"",
        "SOOKIE: I'm trying to plan a menu here, Jackson!",
        "MICHEL: Fill me in, please.",
        "LORELAI: Jackson brought pea tendrils instead of Brussels sprouts.",
        "MICHEL: Well, aren't we Evil Knievel?",
        "LORELAI: Coffee?",
        "MICHEL: Oh, please.",
        "SOOKIE: Pea tendrils are too delicate to serve with the lamb shank!",
        "JACKSON: I don't think that they are.",
        "SOOKIE: Where are the Brussels sprouts?",
        "JACKSON: I looked at the stalks, they weren't good enough.",
        "SOOKIE: You always do this to me.",
        "JACKSON: Doesn't it matter that I care so much about the quality of the produce that I sell you that I'd be willing to risk an enormous argument just to save your dinner.",
        "SOOKIE: What?",
        "LORELAI: Oops, that was dumb.",
        "SOOKIE: Save my dinner?",
        "JACKSON: You know what I meant.",
        "SOOKIE: Yes, my dinner is out standing on a ledge. Oh no! What's gonna happen?",
        "JACKSON: Sookie.",
        "SOOKIE: Oh wait! What's that? It's a bird, it's a plane, it's Super Jackson and his atomic pea tendrils!",
        "JACKSON: You wanna get another produce guy?",
        "SOOKIE: Maybe I should!",
        "JACKSON: Well, go ahead!",
        "SOOKIE: Don't tempt me!",
        "JACKSON: That's it, I am leaving.",
        "SOOKIE: Go! And take the tendrils with you!",
        "JACKSON: Fine! See you tonight?",
        "SOOKIE: I love you.",
        "LORELAI: And it always ends with a hug.",
        "MICHEL: Hm.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, what do you need?",
        "MICHEL: The new insurance policies you ordered.",
        "LORELAI: Good. Now the inspector's supposed to be coming by to check the place out tomorrow, so you're gonna have to show him around.",
        "MICHEL: What?",
        "LORELAI: You're covering for me, remember?",
        "MICHEL: Oh, yes, that's right. Tomorrow the two of you go back to school.",
        "LORELAI: It's not school, it's a one-day course at the learning center.",
        "SOOKIE: How to run an inn.",
        "MICHEL: Yes, amazing you've been able to fake it so long.",
        "LORELAI: This is specific to opening small inns, bed and breakfasts.",
        "MICHEL: I see. Order half of everything. There \u0096 you owe me seventy-five dollars.",
        "LORELAI: Why are you being such a snob about this? You went to hotel school.",
        "MICHEL: I attended the Ecole H\u00f4teli\u00e8re de Gen\u00e8ve.",
        "LORELAI: Wow, that's gotta make one hell of a sweatshirt.",
        "MICHEL: It was one of the premiere hotel schools in the world. You two, on the other hand, are going to take a two-hour course at the Radisson.",
        "SOOKIE: Jackson's taken a lot of courses through The Learning Center and he loves it. He took beekeeping \u0096",
        "LORELAI: Jackson keeps bees?",
        "SOOKIE: No, it turned out he was allergic. One stung his lip and his whole head blew up to three times his normal size.",
        "MICHEL: Please tell me you have pictures.",
        "SOOKIE: He also took a course in how to buy foreclosed real estate, and how to write a diary.",
        "LORELAI: How do you not know how to write a diary?",
        "SOOKIE: He's a searcher.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, he is.",
        "SOOKIE: Plus, I think he was really lonely before we got together and he didn't live near a good bar.",
        "MICHEL: Yes, well, I predict that tomorrow will be a complete waste of time and money, and I will be here to laugh at you when you return.",
        "LORELAI: Thanks for your support. Forget him. Opening our own is a huge step, and anything that might help is worth trying.",
        "SOOKIE: Exactly partner.",
        "LORELAI: Now tell me you got pictures of Jackson and his giant head.",
        "SOOKIE: I'll bring them in tomorrow.",
        "CUT TO CHILTON",
        "[Rory walks into the meeting room; Paris is going through some papers]",
        "RORY: Hey Paris.",
        "PARIS: Have you looked over the votes for commencement speaker?",
        "RORY: Yeah.",
        "PARIS: Are the ones for Princess Diana's butler jokes or real?",
        "RORY: I'd say jokes.",
        "PARIS: What about the ones for Dr. Phil?",
        "RORY: I think real.",
        "PARIS: I knew that suggestion box was a bad idea. Watch Choate get Joan Didion while we're being read \"Eloise at the Plaza.\"",
        "RORY: Listen, before the others get here, we should probably decide what we're going to do.",
        "PARIS: About what?",
        "RORY: About the prom coup Francie staged last week.",
        "PARIS: You mean booking Wadsworth Mansion?",
        "RORY: Using all of the money reserved for the telescope that we wanted to buy for the senior gift.",
        "PARIS: Why does one pinhead always have to vote for Jerry Garcia?",
        "RORY: I'm not sure if the deposit check has been sent yet, but -",
        "PARIS: I already took care of that.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "PARIS: Wadsworth Mansion is owned by the Connecticut Daughters of the Mayflower. Most of those biddies couldn't negotiate an icy sidewalk much less a contract. Took me about five minutes on the phone to get them down to half their asking price.",
        "RORY: You're kidding.",
        "PARIS: Well, there was no way I was letting the class gift be a stupid tree just so Ginger Spice can have her Barbie dream prom.",
        "RORY: She's a sneak.",
        "PARIS: She's not smart enough to be a sneak. Anyone can call a meeting. It's that loser Mr. Hunter that let her get away with it.",
        "RORY: Well, she kind of forced him into it.",
        "PARIS: You can't force a teacher into something, Rory. No, it was Hunter. He's been jealous of me since I got into office. Whenever I announce I have a new motion to introduce, he flinches. Actually, physically tightens up for a moment. It's creepy.",
        "RORY: Yeah, but \u0096",
        "FRANCIE: Well, out fearless leaders at work already. I feel so safe.",
        "RORY: That girl bugs me.",
        "PARIS: Relax, she's harmless.",
        "MR. HUNTER: Paris, Rory.",
        "PARIS: Paris, Rory. Bed wetter. Shall we sit?",
        "RORY: Fine, let's sit.",
        "PARIS: I call this meeting of the student council to order. Is the secretary ready?",
        "MADELINE: I am.",
        "PARIS: Then let's proceed. First of all, I'd like to apologize for missing last week's somewhat impromptu meeting. As most of you know, its scheduling was somewhat unorthodox since the meeting was a supplementary meeting, which was a concept invented by me. So the fact that anyone would hold a meeting invented by a certain person without that certain person seems, well. . .let's see, what's the word? Mutinous, insulting, underhanded, and in the end, fruitless, since I managed to re-negotiate the rental fee for the Wadsworth Mansion so that we'll be able to have the prom and give the school a respectable senior gift in the form of a telescope. Any questions, Mr. Christian? I mean, Mr. Hunter.",
        "MR. HUNTER: Uh, no.",
        "PARIS: Good. So, now that that's out of the way, let's move onto other business. Francie?",
        "FRANCIE: As you know, Health Week is coming up. We have speakers lined up to discuss everything from heart disease and exercise to the dangers of sun damage and fried food. Everyone's booked and ready to go. The only thing left to figure out is where to set up the sign-up table for the annual blood drive.",
        "[Madeline screams]",
        "FRANCIE: Geez!",
        "RORY: What's the matter?",
        "LOUISE: She hates the word blood.",
        "FRANCIE: Give me a heart attack.",
        "LOUISE: Just keep your hands on your ears.",
        "MADELINE: Tell me when it's over.",
        "FRANCIE: As I was saying before the freak-out, we need to figure out where to place the sign up table for the blood drive.",
        "MADELINE: I can still here her.",
        "LOUISE: Hum to yourself.",
        "PARIS: Continue, please.",
        "FRANCIE: I am proposing putting it in the cafeteria. It's got easy access, maximum exposure, and almost ninety percent of the student body visits the cafeteria every day. It's the perfect location.",
        "PARIS: Well?",
        "RORY: No.",
        "FRANCIE: Excuse me?",
        "RORY: You can't set up in the cafeteria. It's a fire hazard.",
        "PARIS: It is?",
        "RORY: Yes, it's a fire hazard. You'll have to find another place.",
        "FRANCIE: You're kidding.",
        "RORY: I never kid about fire safety.",
        "FRANCIE: Well, Rory, I actually know the fire codes for the cafeteria, and as long as we don't cram more than three hundred people in there, we can start an opium den and the fire department wouldn't care.",
        "RORY: A, Francie, I think they would care, and B, I'm not talking about numbers. You set up that table, get people thinking about blood, someone smells smoke, and the next thing you know, fifty stampeding teenagers are using your body to lever open a door. I won't allow that.",
        "FRANCIE: This is Xanadu-level of insane.",
        "PARIS: You do realize you're opposing the blood drive?",
        "RORY: No, I'm opposing the blood drive in the cafeteria.",
        "PARIS: Is it really that big a deal?",
        "RORY: It's the rules, Paris, the rules of common decency, and I'll be damned if I let Francie ignore those rules.",
        "PARIS: Well, okay, motion denied. The senior class president will come up with an alternate plan for the location of the sign-up table for the blood drive. Now Louise, poke John Williams over there and tell her she can cut the score, we're moving on. Advertising space in the yearbook is only fifty percent sold as of right now. What are we doing to do about this? Roger, yes?",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "[Rory is in the living room when Lorelai walks through the front door with two takeout bags]",
        "LORELAI: Dinner!",
        "RORY: Over here.",
        "LORELAI: We are so in luck. It was international grab bag night at Al's.",
        "RORY: Cool. Did you peek?",
        "LORELAI: And ruin the whole point of the mystery dinner? I think not. Pick.",
        "RORY: That one.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. I love this. It's food and a game all in one. Now we open them at the same time.",
        "RORY: I know the rules.",
        "LORELAI: And do not jump the gun.",
        "RORY: There's a lot of pressure associated with international grab bag night.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I am your mother, it is my responsibility to give you structure. Now, on three \u0096 one, two, three.",
        "[they both open their bags and smell the food]",
        "RORY: Hm, Moroccan.",
        "LORELAI: You always say Moroccan.",
        "RORY: And sooner or later, I will be right. What's yours?",
        "LORELAI: Pan-Asian, with a hint of English Colonial, and a few South African influences.",
        "RORY: Way to hedge your bet. Kitchen?",
        "LORELAI: Just let me check the machine.",
        "RORY: Okay.",
        "[Rory walks to the kitchen. Lorelai checks the answering machine]",
        "ANSWERING MACHINE: Ms. Gilmore, it's Bob Merrimam, your mother's lawyer. I'm calling about the little matter of this lawsuit she's involved in. We'd like it if you could give a deposition. . .",
        "LORELAI: Uh. [picks up the phone and dials a number]",
        "ANSWERING MACHINE: . . on her behalf. It shouldn't be a big deal. If you could just call me tomorrow with some times that would be convenient for you, I can set something up. . .",
        "LORELAI: Oh, no!",
        "ANSWERING MACHINE: . . .Thanks, bye.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: No, no, no, no, no.",
        "EMILY: Hello?",
        "LORELAI: No.",
        "EMILY: Who is this?",
        "LORELAI: I am not giving a deposition.",
        "EMILY: Of course you are, don't be ridiculous.",
        "LORELAI: Please leave me out of this.",
        "EMILY: I see. So you're just going to let this lead-footed teutonic chambermaid drag your mother into a public forum and humiliate her, is that it? Is that what I'm hearing?",
        "LORELAI: Mom.",
        "EMILY: Her lawyer knows we asked for this deposition. How do you think it's going to look when you refuse to testify for your own mother?",
        "LORELAI: Like it's none of my business.",
        "EMILY: Oh, and I'm sure the twelve rocket scientists they assemble as a jury of my peers will see it that way.",
        "LORELAI: Honestly, Mom, I doubt they'll be able to find twelve people in the state of Connecticut who haven't been fired by you.",
        "EMILY: I can't believe my own daughter won't come to my defense.",
        "LORELAI: I'm not gonna lie for you.",
        "EMILY: I just want you to tell them how I treat my maids.",
        "LORELAI: I'm not gonna lie for you.",
        "EMILY: All you have to do is tell them I treat the help fairly.",
        "LORELAI: I'm not gonna lie for you.",
        "EMILY: Lorelai, there is something called family loyalty. It means when someone is in trouble, you help them, as I have helped you several times over the years. The very least you could do in return is spend half an hour saying something kind about your mother.",
        "LORELAI: Fine.",
        "EMILY: Thank you. Your devotion is touching. [hangs up]",
        "LORELAI: I have to give a deposition.",
        "RORY: I don't think this is Moroccan \u0096 or at least not recently.",
        "LORELAI: Want some of mine?",
        "RORY: Nope.",
        "LORELAI: Yikes. Luke's?",
        "RORY: Let's go.",
        "CUT TO THE LEARNING CENTER",
        "[Lorelai and Sookie are in their class about opening an inn]",
        "LECTURER: I can't stress enough the value of a good paint job. One of the first decisions you'll have to make when you open your inn is whether to employ your housekeepers individually or contract out to a housekeeping service. If you use a service, you will be assured of having a replacement housekeeper if one should call in sick or quit suddenly.",
        "SOOKIE: But you'll pay two dollars more an hour and they'll be loyal to the service, not to you.",
        "LECTURER: However, you'll probably end up paying a bit more than if you hired them individually.",
        "SOOKIE: I can't believe you're taking notes. He has said nothing in the last two hours that we didn't already know, and he's saying it really condescendingly. So in addition to being bored, I'm getting hostile, and a little insecure \u0091cause you're studying and I'm not.",
        "[Lorelai displays the cootie catcher she's just made]",
        "LORELAI: Pick a color.",
        "SOOKIE: Pink!",
        "LORELAI: \u0091Cause you're a girl.",
        "SOOKIE: Exactly.",
        "LORELAI: P\u0096i\u0096n\u0096k. Pick a number.",
        "SOOKIE: Five.",
        "LORELAI: [opens the flap] You will marry Shaun Cassidy and cheat with David.",
        "SOOKIE: Well, good for me.",
        "LORELAI: My turn.",
        "LECTURER: [clears throat] Some of us are here to learn.",
        "LORELAI: Sorry.",
        "SOOKIE: Yeah, sorry.",
        "LORELAI: We had a cootie catcher. . .",
        "SOOKIE: We're sorry.",

I asked Brian if I could just have a few minutes at the end of today to show you all some opportunities that I think you're going to find really exciting. I know that I do. If we could. [turns on the slide projector] Now this is a lovely property that has just become available right outside of Litchfield.",

        "SOOKIE: I can't believe he opened his own place. He spent the whole summer getting stoned in the walk-in.",
