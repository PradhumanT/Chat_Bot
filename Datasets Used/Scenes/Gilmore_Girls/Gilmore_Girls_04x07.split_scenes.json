        "OPEN AT LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "[Lorelai is sitting at the kitchen table clipping coupons. Rory walks out of her bedroom carrying a bag of laundry, and Lorelai hides the coupons.]",
        "LORELAI: Morning.",
        "RORY: Morning.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, would you be horrified if I started clipping coupons again?",
        "RORY: Yes.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, well, then, I won't.",
        "RORY: Wait, did you say again?",
        "LORELAI: I meant ever.",
        "RORY: When did you clip coupons before?",
        "LORELAI: I didn't. I misspoke. Whoops.",
        "RORY: Uh huh.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, how is it that your dirty laundry has increased exponentially since you started Yale?",
        "RORY: 'Cause I'm a dirty, filthy Yale girl now. [she grabs the page of coupons from the table]",
        "LORELAI: I told you I'm not gonna clip them!",
        "RORY: Then I don't see the problem.",
        "LORELAI: Just for the Fig Newtons, please!",
        "[Rory opens the back door and listens to the music coming from the garage]",
        "RORY: Whoa! That is -",
        "LORELAI: Sucks.",
        "RORY: That is totally sucks. And they're like on their two hundredth guitarist audition.",
        "LORELAI: Well, they must be down to the deaf, dumb, and blind ones. Ah, he found it.",
        "RORY: Found what?",
        "LORELAI: The lost chord.",
        "RORY: So, the washer's broken.",
        "LORELAI: Yup.",
        "RORY: You didn't mention that when you saw me walk out with my exponential amounts of laundry.",
        "LORELAI: Sorry.",
        "RORY: Or when I called from Yale to say that I had exponential amounts of laundry to do.",
        "LORELAI: You've totally co-opted my word.",
        "RORY: Okay, plethora - that's my word. I have a plethora of dirty laundry and nowhere to do it.",
        "LORELAI: But you don't come home to do your laundry. You come home to see your mama.",
        "RORY: No, this time I came home to do my laundry.",
        "LORELAI: All right. I'll call the repairman A.S.A.P.",
        "RORY: Hey, you hear that?",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "RORY: No music.",
        "LORELAI: And the band stopped playing, too.",
        "[Lane walks in through the back door]",
        "RORY: Hi, Lane.",
        "LORELAI: How's it going there?",
        "[Lane walks to the sink, turns the faucet on, and sticks her head under the water.]",
        "RORY: You think she can hear us?",
        "LORELAI: I think out of self-defense her ears have become vestigial organs.",
        "[Lane walks back outside. Rory grabs another page of coupons from the table.]",
        "LORELAI: I'm not clipping coupons!",
        "RORY: Then I don't see the problem.",
        "[Lorelai finds another page of coupons on the table]",
        "LORELAI: Ha.",
        "[opening credits]",
        "CUT TO SOOKIE'S HOUSE",
        "[Lorelai walks in]",
        "LORELAI: Hey, it's your friendly neighborhood Lorelai.",
        "SOOKIE: I'm in the kitchen!",
        "[There's a man sitting in the living room]",
        "LORELAI: Good morning.",
        "BEAU: Is it?",
        "SOOKIE: Just spreading that love and sunshine around, huh, buddy? Lorelai, this is Beau, Jackson's brother. Beau, this is our friend Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: Hi.",
        "BEAU: Hm.",
        "SOOKIE: Come on. Let's leave Oscar Wilde here to his reading.",
        "[Lorelai and Sookie walk to the kitchen]",
        "LORELAI: What's with the 'tude?",
        "SOOKIE: Jackson asked Beau to be here for the birth.",
        "LORELAI: Uh huh.",
        "SOOKIE: Which was supposed to happen a week ago.",
        "LORELAI: Uh huh.",
        "SOOKIE: So Beau's missing way more work than he thought he would, and he's letting me know it.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, it would be nice if God gave us women a pop-up thing when a baby's done like on a turkey, but he chose not to. Hey, Jackson.",
        "JACKSON: Hi. This extra time is great, huh? I'm getting so much done.",
        "SOOKIE: I know. I'm still storing meals. I've got two weeks worth.",
        "BEAU: Hey, Jackson?",
        "JACKSON: Yeah, Beau?",
        "BEAU: What day is it today?",
        "JACKSON: It's Saturday, Beau.",
        "BEAU: I get time and a half on Saturdays.",
        "JACKSON: Uh huh.",
        "BEAU: It gets me my fun things. Otherwise, it's all just bill paying.",
        "JACKSON: [to Sookie] Have I apologized to you enough?",
        "SOOKIE: Yes, Daddy, you have.",
        "JACKSON: So, I got the plastic sheet on the bed. It fits perfectly.",
        "SOOKIE: Excellent.",
        "LORELAI: What's that for?",
        "JACKSON: She doesn't know?",
        "LORELAI: Know about what?",
        "SOOKIE: You ready? This is big. It's really good, and I want you to slowly drink it in. No big gulps.",
        "LORELAI: I'm ready to take a sip.",
        "SOOKIE: We're skipping the hospital and having the baby here.",
        "LORELAI: Here in your house?",
        "SOOKIE: In our bed.",
        "LORELAI: Hence the sheet.",
        "JACKSON: Got a honey of a sheet. It's the top of the line. The little thing will come out and carom right down into the catcher's arms.",
        "LORELAI: While we all yell, \"hey, batter, batter, batter\"?",
        "SOOKIE: He means the midwife. Got the best one on the eastern seaboard.",
        "JACKSON: You look mystified.",
        "LORELAI: No, it's just. . .uh, you guys have done a lot of research on this, right?",
        "SOOKIE: Millions of babies have been born this way.",
        "JACKSON: It's a great tradition.",
        "SOOKIE: And hospitals are so cold, you know, so full of infections.",
        "JACKSON: And dead people.",
        "SOOKIE: And sometimes the dead people have infections.",
        "JACKSON: And if they're not dead yet, they die.",
        "LORELAI: All true.",
        "JACKSON: But the best thing about having little Davey or Colgate here - zero chance of bringing home the wrong baby. What comes out of her here, stays here. Oh, I got something for you. [hands Lorelai a pager] It's a baby pager. It'll go off when Sookie's close.",
        "[\"The Entertainer\" plays from the pager]",
        "LORELAI: Oh, cute.",
        "JACKSON: Scott Joplin seemed appropriately sunny.",
        "SOOKIE: I want you to be here even if home birth disgusts you.",
        "LORELAI: Of course I'll be here. Nothing could keep me away.",
        "JACKSON: Ohh! Extra buckets - I gotta put it on the list.",
        "LORELAI: Extra buckets? What's that. . .hm. Never mind.",
        "CUT TO THE DANCE STUDIO",
        "[Townspeople are gathering for a town meeting]",
        "KIRK: Excuse me. Can my girlfriend and I sit here? This is my girlfriend.",
        "LULU: Hi.",
        "MAN: Hi.",
        "KIRK: My girlfriend and I appreciate it.",
        "LULU: Yes, thank you.",
        "KIRK: I got a pretty polite girlfriend.",
        "BABETTE: Should we be nervous about this?",
        "ANDREW: I don't know. Did Taylor tell anyone why he called an emergency meeting?",
        "KIRK: He said nothing to me or my girlfriend.",
        "MISS PATTY: I can't remember the last town emergency meeting he called.",
        "KIRK: Me and my girlfriend can't either.",
        "RORY: Home birth?",
        "LORELAI: I was horrified and I hid it horribly. I wanted to be supportive but throw up at the same time.",
        "RORY: A plastic sheet?",
        "LORELAI: I saw it. It was the same one that boy who couldn't hold it had to use in that after-school special. What was that called?",
        "RORY: \"It's Not Benny's Fault.\"",
        "LORELAI: Oh, God. It was so insane. It's what hospitals are for.",
        "KIRK: Hey, Lane, there's a seat behind my girlfriend.",
        "LANE: That's okay, Kirk. Hi.",
        "LORELAI: Hi.",
        "RORY: Hey.",
        "LANE: Get this. I just found the most amazing guitarist - a phenom. He was cool on the phone, and we're meeting him tomorrow.",
        "RORY: That's great.",
        "LANE: I'm trying not to get my hopes up, but I've already figured out that our Spin cover should be against a bloodred backdrop with a skull hovering over us.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, well, very Norman Rockwell.",
        "RORY: That woman's staring at me.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, Mrs. Van-uppity? Well, maybe you're just her type.",
        "TAYLOR: People, thank you for assembling on such short notice.",
        "BABETTE: What's up, Taylor?",
        "KIRK: My girlfriend was wondering that, too.",
        "TAYLOR: As you know, every year, one lucky town in Connecticut gets to host \"The Festival of Living Pictures,\" a show which presents onstage recreations of famous works of art - statues, paintings, et cetera, with real people posing as the figures in the art. We hosted it seven years ago - successfully, I might add.",
        "BABETTE: Yeah, it was a blast.",
        "LORELAI: Definitely.",
        "KIRK: My girlfriend's gonna love this.",
        "TAYLOR: The town of Woodbury was supposed to host it this year, but because of recent flooding, they canceled at the last minute, and I offered Stars Hollow to be the host. How does that sound?",
        "RORY: Cool.",
        "BABETTE: Yeah, sign us up.",
        "MISS PATTY: Yeah, Taylor, you finally did something right. Your beard is so sexy.",
        "ANDREW: How much time do we have?",
        "TAYLOR: One week. And as per tradition, we need to come up with one original recreation to go with all the others that are in the show every year.",
        "MISS PATTY: Well, that's not a lot of time.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, Taylor, is it even possible?",
        "TAYLOR: Well, it'll have to be. I've already assured Hank, who is the Taylor Doose of Woodbury, that we'd take it over successfully. It's a challenge, people, but doable. Now, I would like to introduce you to a key player in our execution of this endeavor, the head of the Connecticut Arts Council, Buff Otis.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, it's your future wife.",
        "RORY: Shut up.",
        "TAYLOR: Would you like to say a few words, Mrs. Otis?",
        "MRS. OTIS: Your enthusiasm. . .shocks me.",
        "LORELAI: Is that good?",
        "RORY: Hard to tell.",
        "LANE: It might be.",
        "BABETTE: Scary broad.",
        "TAYLOR: I will be managing the event and emceeing. Uh, Miss Patty, you will be stage-managing. Uh, Lorelai, if you could help organize the costumes?",
        "LORELAI: I'm here for you and your sexy beard, Taylor.",
        "TAYLOR: Um, everyone should sign up now if you want to be considered to be cast in one of the recreations. Mrs. Otis and I will make the final decisions.",
        "BABETTE: Hey, you're gonna be the girl in that Renoir painting again, right? You were such a doll in that.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, I'm sure I can be persuaded.",
        "TAYLOR: This is an enormous challenge, people, but I say we do it and do it well. Meeting adjourned.",
        "LORELAI: Wait.",
        "RORY: Why?",
        "LORELAI: I want to see if she asks you out.",
        "RORY: Ugh.",
        "CUT TO LUKE'S DINER",
        "[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at a table]",
        "LORELAI: I wonder if I want to be something other than the Renoir girl.",
        "RORY: I'm sorry, the audience has come to expect you in the role of Renoir girl. You can't disappoint them. It's a plum role.",
        "LORELAI: True, true.",
        "LUKE: Sorry I took so long. I was dealing with more divorce-lawyer stuff.",
        "LORELAI: Good Lord, is Nicole's lawyer still harassing you?",
        "LUKE: No, mine was. And please don't point out the irony of my paying a lawyer to work for me.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, but then you're gonna owe me something else I can ironically comment on.",
        "LUKE: Fine. Hey, what was that emergency meeting all about?",
        "RORY: We're hosting \"The Festival of Living Pictures\" again.",
        "LUKE: Oh, joy.",
        "LORELAI: His lack of enthusiasm shocks me.",
        "LUKE: You're involving yourself in this thing? It's such a stupid waste of time.",
        "LORELAI: I just thought of the perfect painting for Luke to be in. \"Cranky Guy in Baseball Cap.\"",
        "RORY: Was that Manet or Monet?",
        "LORELAI: That was mustard on my hamburger and a side of fries, please.",
        "RORY: She's the queen of segues.",
        "LUKE: She's the queen of something. You want your usual?",
        "RORY: Yes, please. Maybe I'll just be a backstage person this year. There's less pressure. You don't have to get made up, and. . .[sees Taylor and Mrs. Otis staring at her through the diner window] What are they doing?",
        "LORELAI: Well, I bet she's coming to -",
        "RORY: Hey, and no more inappropriate lesbian references, please.",
        "LORELAI: All right. Oh, you know what? I bet you're in line for the new painting they're cooking up.",
        "RORY: I feel like a used car.",
        "TAYLOR: Turn to the side.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "TAYLOR: Turn to the side. We need to see your profile.",
        "LORELAI: Just what I thought.",
        "RORY: This is a violation of my civil rights.",
        "LORELAI: You better do what John Ashcroft says or they may just follow us home.",
        "RORY: Unbelievable.",
        "TAYLOR: Other way. Other way.",
        "RORY: I'm a Yale student, for God's sake.",
        "TAYLOR: Thank you.",
        "RORY: Crazy, doofus town.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah.",
        "CUT TO THE DANCE STUDIO",
        "TAYLOR: Let's not loiter around the cast sheets, people. Find your name and then move on.",
        "ANDREW: Oh, cool. I'm gonna be some statue.",
        "TAYLOR: You're \"The Reaper,\" Andrew - a prize work at Versailles and a prize role, not some statue.",
        "ANDREW: So I get to be painted all white, huh?",
        "TAYLOR: Yes, that's what that means.",
        "LORELAI: Hi, Taylor. When are the costumes getting here?",
        "TAYLOR: Hank in Woodbury swears they're en route, but you gotta double and triple-check with that guy.",
        "LORELAI: Hank's the you in Woodbury.",
        "TAYLOR: A real ninny. He's praying we don't pull this off, but that only inspires me to work harder.",
        "KIRK: I need to see the list.",
        "JOE: Watch the elbows, Kirk.",
        "KIRK: I just need to see the list.",
        "MISS PATTY: He's going to be very happy.",
        "KIRK: Woohoo!",
        "LORELAI: What'd you get, Kirk?",
        "KIRK: Christ in \"The Last Supper.\"",
        "LORELAI: The big kahuna.",
        "KIRK: I'm gonna do it right, too. Lots of research. What's a good book to read?",
        "LORELAI: Uh, the bible?",
        "KIRK: Right. Yo, where are my apostles? Where are my homeboys? James, son of Alpheus, give me five.",
        "JOE: All right.",
        "KIRK: Simon, the Canaanite, don't leave me hanging. I say we go celebrate. How 'bout Shakey's?",
        "MAN: All right.",
        "JOE: Cool.",
        "MISS PATTY: That is one happy Christ.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, well, it was nice of you guys to give him that.",
        "MISS PATTY: Oh, I wanted to show you this. It's our original picture. Well, we think Rory would be perfect for it. It's called \"Portrait of a Young Girl Named Anthea.\"",
        "LORELAI: Wow, that's Rory.",
        "MISS PATTY: Do you think she'll do it?",
        "LORELAI: Well, you got some sway with me.",
        "MISS PATTY: Good, good.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, I'm confused.",
        "MISS PATTY: I should go make my calls.",
        "LORELAI: I'm not the, uh, Renoir girl.",
        "MISS PATTY: Oh, really? I didn't realize that. . .",
        "LORELAI: Patty, I'm the spitting image of the Renoir girl. I played her seven years ago and received the proper accolades. This is a mistake.",
        "MISS PATTY: Maybe.",
        "LORELAI: Um, Taylor?",
        "TAYLOR: Yes, Lorelai?",
        "LORELAI: I'm not listed as the Renoir girl. Is that a mistake?",
        "TAYLOR: Frankly, no, it's not.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, I'm not listed as anything else, either.",
        "TAYLOR: That's also correct. You'll be helping with costumes.",
        "LORELAI: I don't get it. Why am I not the Renoir girl? I'm the spitting image.",
        "TAYLOR: You are. Your look is perfect.",
        "LORELAI: Then why am I not the Renoir girl?",
        "TAYLOR: I really have to tell you why?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, you do.",
        "TAYLOR: You flinched.",
        "LORELAI: I what?",
        "TAYLOR: Seven years ago, the curtain opened. You were posed in the painting, then you flinched noticeably.",
        "LORELAI: I did not flinch.",
        "TAYLOR: We thought you were having an attack.",
        "LORELAI: I did not flinch!",
        "TAYLOR: You almost knocked Terrence over.",
        "LORELAI: I did not!",
        "TAYLOR: The whole town saw it. And with Hank from Woodbury looking over my shoulder, I'm not taking any risks.",
        "LORELAI: Patty, please, back me up here.",
        "MISS PATTY: Oh, honey, I'm sorry, you flinched!",
        "TAYLOR: Big-time.",
        "MISS PATTY: You almost knocked Terrence over.",
        "TAYLOR: Yeah, you screwed the pooch, so you're out. I'm sorry.",
        "MISS PATTY: So, you'll ask Rory about the painting?",
        "CUT TO THE YALE LAUNDRY ROOM",
        "[Lorelai and Rory are ding laundry]",
        "LORELAI: It's humiliating!",
        "RORY: You and the Renoir girl - it was a lock.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, until this smear campaign. There's a lot of tension in the air here.",
        "RORY: Well, it's midterms.",
        "LORELAI: You seem calm.",
        "RORY: Well, on the outside. Is this what you're using, Dream Fresh laundry powder?",
        "LORELAI: It's a new brand.",
        "RORY: It's an off-brand.",
        "LORELAI: It leaves your clothes with that Dream-Fresh scent.",
        "RORY: You used a coupon, didn't you?",
        "LORELAI: Thirty-five cents off or not, I still would have chosen Dream Fresh.",
        "RORY: So, who'd they pick for the Renoir girl?",
        "LORELAI: Carol Dandridge.",
        "RORY: Carol Dandridge?",
        "LORELAI: Carol Dandruff from now on!",
        "RORY: Okay, now, don't take it out on poor Carol. It's not like she lobbied for it.",
        "LORELAI: I bet she did. That would be just like that old porky, doody-dridge.",
        "RORY: Oh, wow. You're really bummed about this, aren't you?",
        "LORELAI: On the outside, I am a mature adult who's able to put setbacks like this in their proper place, and on the inside, I just wanna wear that pretty dress again!",
        "RORY: You will.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, if a brick lands on Taylor's head and he suddenly likes me again. Ooh, a brick.",
        "RORY: You don't need a brick. You have me. I'll take care of it.",
        "LORELAI: What are you talking about?",
        "RORY: You are going to be the Renoir girl - end of story.",
        "LORELAI: How?",
        "RORY: Well, if they want an Anthea for \"Portrait of a Young Girl Named Anthea,\" then they're going to have to have you for the Renoir girl.",
        "LORELAI: Well, look at you folding your laundry all haughty and powerful.",
        "RORY: Bada-bing all over his nice ivy-league suit.",
        "LORELAI: Rory, you couldn't do that. Come on. It would be embarrassing, it would be manipulative, and can you do it tonight?",
        "RORY: I think I'll wait until the Anthea costume is perfectly fitted to my specifications. Then we won't have no surprises.",
        "LORELAI: I am in awe.",
        "RORY: Pass me the Dream Fresh?",
        "LORELAI: I wouldn't dare not to.",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S GARAGE",
        "[The band is setting up]",
        "LANE: I don't know about you, but I'm completely jazzed about this.",
        "ZACH: This is the first time I've been excited about playing since Dave.",
        "BRIAN: If he's half as good as this tape, I'm gonna plotz.",
        "[A man enters the garage]",
        "LANE: Can we help you?",
        "GIL: Yeah, I'm looking for Lane.",
        "LANE: I'm Lane.",
        "GIL: Am I late?",
        "LANE: For?",
        "GIL: The audition.",
