        "[Lorelai is carrying a large garbage bag full of shoes and not looking where she is going. Miss Patty exits a shop.]",
        "PATTY: Whoa, honey.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.",
        "PATTY: Goodness, what's left to wear on your feet?",
        "LORELAI: I know it's a sickness. Everyone thinks it started with Bradshaw but actually it came over on the Mayflower.",
        "PATTY: What a wonderful history lesson.",
        "LORELAI: Anytime.",
        "[Man shouting in a foreign language inside a shop. Lorelai drops her bag as something flies out the door at her.]",
        "PATTY: Pasqualie's feeling unappreciated again.",
        "LORELAI: We had 'Stars Hollow Loves Pasqualie Day' last week.",
        "PATTY: Didn't stick. Oh, listen. I want to invite you to my anniversary party.",
        "LORELAI: Absolutely. Which husband?",
        "PATTY: Oh, no husband, honey. I'm talking about a lover that's been much more loyal and seductive than a husband. I'm talking about that business we call show.",
        "LORELAI: Ah.",
        "PATTY: Forty years.",
        "LORELAI: No.",
        "PATTY: Forty years ago today I did my first play off Broadway.",

        "PATTY: Cleveland.",
        "LORELAI: That is off Broadway.",
        "PATTY: Anyhow, I thought I'd throw a big party. Food, booze, a little song, a little dance. A little salsa down your pants.",
        "LORELAI: Well, count me and my pants in.",
        "PATTY: Oh, wonderful!",
        "LORELAI: [picking up her bag] I will even drag Luke there. So if there's any audience participation, please pick on him.",
        "PATTY: Oh, Luke won't come.",
        "LORELAI: Sure, he will. I have very effective methods of persuasion. They include extremely high heels and all of Jessica Simpson's bath products.",
        "PATTY: Oh, no, honey. The party's on Tuesday the 30th.",
        "LORELAI: So?",
        "PATTY: So, the 30th is the dark day",
        "LORELAI: [dropping her bag again] What dark day?",
        "PATTY: Luke's dark day. The day that he disappears.",
        "LORELAI: Disappears where?",
        "PATTY: Nobody knows. Nobody knows where he goes or what he does. All we know is not to try and find him.",
        "LORELAI: Why didn't I know about this?",
        "PATTY: I don't know, honey. Everyone else does. Anyhow you come yourself, ok? Eight o' clock.",
        "LORELAI: I'll be there. See you Tuesday, Patty. [Walks into shop] Oh Pasqualie, the maestro! My god, you look virile today. Are you sure your wife won't share you?",
        "PATTY: [watching Lorelai] Oh, she's good.",

        "RORY: Sorry, I'm just getting water, here.",
        "TERRANCE: Paris, you're not yelling at me. You're yelling at the world.",
        "PARIS: I'm not yelling at all. This is the natural register of my voice.",
        "[Rory looks around the room and in cupboards.]",
        "TERRANCE: It's the register of a timid little girl, who is not putting her self out there.",
        "PARIS: I am putting myself out there.",
        "TERRANCE: Why are you arguing with Terrance? Why?",
        "PARIS: Look, I know I haven't dated lately but Asher was very important to me.",
        "RORY: Hey Paris? I can't find my notebook. The black one with all my yellow notes in it.",
        "TERRANCE: You have not put yourself out there.",
        "PARIS: He just died.",
        "TERRANCE: Oh for god's sake! He was halfway dead when you met him. [to Rory] Rory, has she been putting herself out there or not?",
        "RORY: Out where?",
        "TERRANCE: Out in the world. Has she tried to meet men since Asher died?",
        "PARIS: You don't just meet people. It doesn't happen.",
        "RORY: Um, I'll just go in my room now.",
        "TERRANCE: Look at your dream log. You are months behind. And your pretty-thoughts journal.",
        "PARIS: Ok, fine. I have neglected thinking pretty, but I hardly think I should be penalized for time lost while you were in court ordered rehab.",
        "RORY: [picking up a note by the phone] Hey, Paris? What's this?",
        "TERRANCE: I had a back problem. The prescription was at home in my Filofax.",
        "RORY: This is a message from Headmaster Charleston. When did Headmaster Charleston call?",
        "PARIS: Earlier.",
        "RORY: And you didn't tell me?",
        "PARIS: I'm in session.",
        "RORY: [on phone] Hello, Headmaster Charleston? This is Rory Gilmore. I'm sorry it took so long to call you back. I just got your message.",
        "TERRANCE: [to Rory] Sweetie, that was a little passive-aggressive. We should talk later.",

        "HDM. CHARLESTON: Is it everything you thought it would be?",
        "RORY: It's nothing like I thought it would be. It's better actually.",
        "HDM. CHARLESTON: I have no doubt. Now, I'm calling because we often ask a former Chilton student to host a prospective Yale student for a few days. Show them around. Let them observe classes, campus life. That sort of thing. I was wondering if you'd be interested.",
        "RORY: Me?",
        "HDM. CHARLESTON: Yes. This is a very special young lady. Bright, focused, quietly determined. She reminds me a great deal of you.",
        "RORY: Thank you.",
        "HDM. CHARLESTON: I assume you haven't changed.",
        "RORY: Well, I've upgraded the wardrobe a little bit but I'm basically still me.",
        "HDM. CHARLESTON: Excellent. Then I hope you'll consider accepting. I know your workload must be substantial.",
        "RORY: That's ok I can handle it.",
        "HDM. CHARLESTON: So I can take that as a yes?",
        "RORY: Yes. Take it as a yes and thank you. I'm honored.",
        "HDM. CHARLESTON: Her name is Anna Fairchild. She's 16 years old and she'll be arriving Monday morning at nine o' clock. Does that work for you?",
        "RORY: That works perfectly.",
        "HDM. CHARLESTON: Very well, it's a date. I'm very glad to talk to you again, Ms. Gilmore. Yale certainly sounds like its agreeing with you. I hope it will also agree with Ms. Fairchild.",
        "RORY: Like Sabrina!",
        "HDM. CHARLESTON: I beg your pardon?",
        "RORY: Sabrina Fairchild. That was her name.",
        "HDM. CHARLESTON: Have we segued into discussing a movie?",
        "RORY: And we can segue right out again.",
        "HDM. CHARLESTON: I'm very grateful for that. All right then, my office will be contacting you with the particulars. I hope you have a wonderful time. I'm sure Ms. Fairchild will.",
        "RORY: Thank you, Headmaster Charleston. I won't let you down.",
        "HDM. CHARLESTON: What a nice thing to hear. I'm sure we'll be talking soon. Goodbye.",

        "RORY: Oh, I know.",
        "RICHARD: Of all the Chilton alumni at Yale they're asking you?",
        "RORY: I know, I know.",
        "RICHARD: Well, have you thought about what kind of things you'd like to show her?",
        "RORY: Well, she'll go to all of my classes with me, of course. And I thought maybe she'd go to the paper with me and then I thought maybe a trip to the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library.",
        "RICHARD: Oh, you're going to show her the Gutenberg.",
        "LORELAI: Steve?",
        "RICHARD: Bible.",
        "LORELAI: Right.",
        "RORY: Then I was torn between taking her to the Hewitt Memorial Quadrangle or the Science Center and Gymnasium.",
        "RICHARD: Huh, that is a conundrum.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, especially since she'll be snoring by then. You'll just be dragging her dead body weight around the campus.",
        "RICHARD: Lorelai, these things are of great interest to any young person considering attending Yale.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, I am sure.",
        "RORY: I, personally, would enjoy every single thing on my list.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, I know, but it wouldn't hurt to maybe throw a little something fun in. I'm not talking a kegger, but just walk her by the crazy drama students yelling \"Give me a location,\" or something like that.",
        "RICHARD: You know, your mother may be right.",
        "LORELAI: Who heard that?",
        "RICHARD: Well, a good college experience is a well-rounded college experience. It's important for you to show her that Yale students have fun too. Oh! Have her touch the toe!",
        "RORY: Yeah!",
        "LORELAI: Touch the toe?",
        "RORY: The toe! The statue of Theodore Woolsey. It brings good luck to everyone who touches his feet and for that reason he has one left toe that's been rubbed completely shiny.",
        "LORELAI: Wow! That is fun. Make sure you get a parent consent form for that one.",
        "RICHARD: Oh, its so exciting watching you at Yale. It was such a wonderful time for me. The people that you meet there will stay with you for the rest of your life, mark my words. Tell me are you making good friends?",
        "RORY: Yeah, I have some good friends.",
        "RICHARD: And what about Mr. Huntzberger?",
        "LORELAI: Who is Mr. Huntzberger?",
        "RORY: Um, Logan Huntzberger is a boy I go to school with.",
        "RICHARD: A fine boy from a fine family.",
        "LORELAI: You know him?",
        "RICHARD: His parents are very good friends of ours. Oh, you know Mitchum Huntzberger, Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: No.",
        "RICHARD: He's been coming to our Christmas parties for years.",
        "LORELAI: No.",
        "RICHARD: His mother's on the pediatric hospital committee with your mother.",
        "LORELAI: Oh! No.",
        "RICHARD: Well, Logan is their son and I noticed that you two seemed to be hitting it off the other night.",
        "LORELAI: The other night?",
        "RORY: He's very nice, Grandpa.",
        "RICHARD: Now I don't want to be too forward, but you made a handsome couple.",
        "LORELAI: Uh, was Logan at the male-Yale party that you guys threw?",
        "RORY: He was the one that gave me a ride home, Mom.",
        "LORELAI: Oh! Limo boy. Swell.",
        "RORY: He's also on the paper with me.",
        "RICHARD: You know, his father owns some of the finest newspapers in the country.",
        "RORY: I know.",
        "RICHARD: Not a bad connection, huh? Nope, not a bad connection at all.",

        "[Lorelai and Rory are walking to the main house]",
        "LORELAI: Hey. So tell me about this Logan.",
        "RORY: Its three degrees out here!",
        "LORELAI: Uh, as of tonight, my father knows way more personal dish about you than I do. That's not right or fair. He doesn't get as much enjoyment out of the dish as I do. With him the dish is always half empty.",
        "RORY: You're just talking to keep yourself warm, aren't you?",
        "LORELAI: What is the deal with this guy? Are you dating?",
        "RORY: No, we're not dating. He's just a friend.",
        "LORELAI: How close? For example, if you freeze to death will he come to the funeral or just send a nice fruit basket?",
        "RORY: I know him from school. He's just a casual friend. That's it.",
        "LORELAI: Do you think he's cute?",
        "RORY: It doesn't matter if I think he's cute.",
        "LORELAI: Uh, it matters to me. I don't want ugly grandchildren.",
        "RORY: Mom, I'm not dating Logan or anyone. I'm taking a boy break. Okay? I'm just concentrating on school. That's it.",
        "LORELAI: Fine, but if that changes?",
        "RORY: You'll be the first to know.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, thank you. Cause there are not many ways I can outdo my father. Info on you and looking better in chiffon, that's about it. Oh and my pole dance is way hotter.",
        "RORY: I'm frozen now.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, let's go.",
        "CUT TO LUKE'S APARTMENT",
        "[Lorelai walks in wearing Luke's flannel shirt and carrying a whole pie on her arm. Luke is at the kitchen table pouring juice.]",
        "LORELAI: In my hand, ladies and gentlemen, sits the true advantage of dating a diner owner. I am never more than ten feet away from pie.",
        "LUKE: Ah. See, I thought it was the way we always smell faintly of meat.",
        "LORELAI: [climbs into bed] Ah! Its heaven! One quick trip downstairs and I have all the treats I want. You're like Willy Wonka, but hotter.",
        "LUKE: I am not hotter than Willy Wonka.",
        "LORELAI: Slap on a purple top hat and you're close. [Luke gets into bed] This is nice.",
        "LUKE: Mm-hmm.",
        "LORELAI: I think its going very well, you and me. Do you think its going very well?",
        "LUKE: [rubbing Lorelai's leg] I have very few complaints.",
        "LORELAI: Hmm, I'm going right past the \"very few complaints\" comment because I know you're just trying to bait me. What complaints? [Luke chuckles]Hey, so Luke, Miss Patty is celebrating her forty year anniversary.",
        "LUKE: Which husband?",
        "LORELAI: With the business we call show.",
        "LUKE: Oh, him.",
        "LORELAI: And she's having a big party and I told her we'd go.",
        "LUKE: Oh man.",
        "LORELAI: It'll be fun.",
        "LUKE: It will not be fun.",
        "LORELAI: She'll be wearing tap shoes. There'll be songs and punch and at least one story about Milton Berle's pen1s.",
        "LUKE: Only one?",
        "LORELAI: Come on! I have to have you there. Otherwise people will think I made you up.",
        "LUKE: Fine, I'll go.",
        "LORELAI: Thank you. Okay, so its Tuesday at Eight o' clock.",
        "[ Luke sits up and climbs under the covers]",

        "LUKE: Business.",
        "LORELAI: Business? Now your Willy Loman?",
        "LUKE: Banking business in Woodbury. Standing appointment. Sorry. Hit the light, will ya? [kisses Lorelai] I have to get up early. Night.",

        "PARIS: Its freezing outside.",
        "RORY: Oh wait. This is new. They just came out with these. The Yale soda-cozy. How cute is that?",
        "PARIS: I can't believe you. You don't even have your loser card-swiping job anymore and you're buying all this crap for some kid you don't even know.",
        "RORY: I'm trying to make her feel welcome.",
        "PARIS: Oh she'll feel welcome. They all feel welcome.",
        "RORY: Whose they?",
        "PARIS: The enemy.",

        "PARIS: Any girl under the age of 17 is the enemy.",

        "RORY: Don't you have a class to get to? [opens the window]",
        "PARIS: They're coming, Rory. They're coming and they're going to keep on coming like the locusts descending on Mankato. We'll be beating them off for the rest of our lives.",
        "RORY: Please don't be here when she arrives. I don't want you to scare her off.",

        "RORY: Anna, this is my roommate, Paris, and I'm sorry.",
        "ANNA: For what?",
        "RORY: Trust me.",
        "ANNA: Ok.",
        "RORY: Ok, let me show you around the place. That is Paris' room.",
        "PARIS: Don't go in.",

        "ANNA: Oh, really? Thank you.",
        "RORY: I'm really glad you're here. You are going to love Yale. It's an amazing place. I mean I was excited when I first started here, but every day is different and better. You have no idea how much there is to learn. It's -- Well you'll see.",
        "[Knock on the door. Marty enters with a bag of food.]",
        "MARTY: Okay, I actually snagged us some caviar. They were all out of toast points, but I think we can use Doritos and achieve a very similar result. [seeing Anna] Hey.",

        "[Rory and Anna are walking. Rory is talking, Anna writing down everything she says.]",
        "RORY: The oldest part of the campus is, of course, the old campus. And it houses much of the undergraduate freshman class. It was begun by Theodore Dwight Woolsey, president of Yale from 1846 to 1871. [Stops at bench] Over here is the Elihu Yale bench. Now Eli Yale was an officer in the British East India Company. He gave what was then called the Collegiate School 562 pounds, 417 books and a portrait of King George the first and so it was renamed in his honor. He actually gave an additional 500 pounds to the school, but Yale College never received it because he mistakenly sent it to the non-existent Collegiate School, apparently forgetting that Yale was named after him. [stops] Oh wait. This is the wrong bench. So keep the story but cross out the diagram. Moving on.",

        "[Rory and Anna walk down the hallway.]",
        "RORY: There's actually an ongoing rumor that you can automatically graduate and earn your degree if you become sufficiently fluent in Latin, Greek and Hebrew. Imagine all the tables you could wait with those skills, huh? [stops at door] Okay, you are about to get a first-hand feel of what it's like to work on a real newspaper. Now, be prepared. It can be an extremely hectic and fast-paced environment. Don't get intimidated and don't get in the way. Ready? Here it is.[They enter the room. It is mostly empty, save for a few people sitting around, doing nothing.] Everyone must be out getting a scoop or something, but you just wait. It could heat up in a second and when it does, man, watch out. My desk is over here.",

        "DOYLE: Hey! I am the editor, Paris, and I demand that you tell me.",
        "PARIS: I won't tell you where I got it, Doyle.",
        "DOYLE: You will if you want to stay on this newspaper.",
        "RORY: Okay, you are now privy to one of the classic journalist dilemmas between reporter and editor, the right to withhold and protect sources.",
        "DOYLE: Dammit, Paris, you tell me where you got that pen right now.",
        "PARIS: The pen fairy.",
        "DOYLE: That was one of my personal fine point, gel tip pens from my bottom right-hand drawer and you went into that drawer and you took that pen and its mine.",
        "RORY: Ok, for 'fine point gel tip' substitute 'confidential source deep within the administration.' Hmm, you get a little thrill. Don't you? [Phone rings]",

        "RORY: I've heard nothing about this.",
        "LORELAI: Ok, well, did we see him on November 30th last year?",
        "RORY: How am I supposed to know?",

He gave what was then called the Collegiate School 562 pounds, 417 books and a portrait of King George the first and so it was renamed in his honor. He actually gave an additional 500 pounds to the school, but Yale College never received it because he mistakenly sent it to the non-existent Collegiate School, apparently forgetting that Yale was named after him.
