        "Rory asks Richard for help in creating and marketing a first-aid kit for Chilton's annual Business Fair, which leads him to realize that he is unhappy in retirement and wants to start a second career; fresh from having underbid on Rory's lunch basket and the loss of the bracelet he made for her, Dean goes overboard in trying to be close to Rory, afraid that she is losing interest in him, and finally becomes resigned to her affection for Jess; at first, Michel is ecstatic when his flamboyant mother Giselle visits, but after Lorelai causes problems for him when she reveals to Giselle that Michel has been holding back from his mother, Michel quickly is driven crazy by his mother's incessant questioning."

        "[Lorelai, Rory and Emily are sitting at the table staring at the food.]",
        "LORELAI: Mom.",
        "EMILY: No.",
        "LORELAI: We're starving.",
        "EMILY: We're waiting for your father.",
        "LORELAI: It's gonna get cold.",
        "EMILY: We are waiting for your father.",
        "LORELAI: We've been waiting forever.",
        "EMILY: We have not been waiting forever.",
        "LORELAI: Forever. Godot was just here. He said \u0091I ain't waiting for Richard,' grabbed a roll, and left. It's been forever.",
        "EMILY: When we gather as a family, we eat as a family. We don't eat in shifts \u0096 you know that and Richard certainly knows that.",
        "RORY: When did he get that antique car anyhow?",
        "EMILY: A couple of horrible weeks ago.",
        "LORELAI: What happened to the oil painting hobby of his?",
        "EMILY: Ah, you know your father. When he couldn't foresee rivaling Cezanne, he lost interest so he bought that car. Lorelai!",
        "[Lorelai spits out the piece of candy she was about to eat]",
        "LORELAI: Mom, it's not dinner, it's just my private stash.",
        "EMILY: It's eating and we're not eating.",
        "LORELAI: You know, you're bound by the rules of the Geneva Convention, Mother, just like everyone else. Hey, no one told me it was casual Friday.",
        "RICHARD: Hello everyone. You haven't started?",
        "EMILY: Of course we haven't started, we were waiting for you. I thought you were almost done.",
        "RICHARD: Well, I was but this car has a mind of its own. As I turned to leave it began spraying some sort of green solution at me.",
        "RORY: Yuck.",
        "RICHARD: Yuck, indeed. Well, go on, start.",
        "LORELAI: Ooh!",
        "RICHARD: No sense in waiting for me.",
        "LORELAI: Coolness!",
        "EMILY: Stop!",
        "LORELAI: Gomer said!",
        "EMILY: We are waiting for you, Richard. In thirty\u0096five years, I have never ever started a dinner without you unless you were out of town or seriously ill. Elsa, take everything away and keep it warm! Now please go upstairs and get ready so we can all enjoy a nice family dinner. . .together.",
        "RICHARD: I'll be right back.",
        "LORELAI: Right back, Dad, like right back. In fact, change on the way upstairs. And make it a Navy shower \u0096 quick soap, quick rinse and no excessive posing! Hungry.",
        "CUT TO LUKE'S DINER",
        "[Rory and Lorelai walk through the door]",
        "LORELAI: Hey there. Anywhere?",
        "LUKE: Anywhere you want.",
        "LORELAI: Could you move please?",
        "CUSTOMER: What?",
        "LUKE: Anywhere where there's not people.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, well, like I'm a mind reader. I was just joking. Hmm, that's funny.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: Something's different here, something's changed.",
        "RORY: Impossible.",
        "LORELAI: No, I swear, there's something.",
        "RORY: You know, I'd be very disappointed if something changed in here.",
        "LORELAI: Why are you so anti-change?",
        "RORY: Because most change sucks.",
        "LORELAI: That's true, it does. Uh! The chalkboard!",
        "RORY: What about it?",
        "LORELAI: Luke's special omelet. That is brand new.",
        "RORY: A new special? His four-slice French toast has been up there since I was born!",
        "LORELAI: You just gotta let that go, baby.",
        "LUKE: What can I get you?",
        "LORELAI: You have a new special.",
        "LUKE: I sure do.",
        "LORELAI: Nice. What is the special omelet?",
        "LUKE: You won't like it.",
        "LORELAI: How do you know?",
        "LUKE: Because you've been eating here for years and I know what you like, and you won't like it.",
        "LORELAI: Can I at least hear what it is?",
        "LUKE: Fine. It's three eggs with bits of bacon.",
        "LORELAI: I like bacon.",
        "LUKE: Cubed tomatoes.",
        "LORELAI: Sounds good.",
        "LUKE: Swiss cheese and a dash of oregano.",
        "LORELAI: A dash, he says.",
        "LUKE: I've got other customers here.",
        "LORELAI: I'm gonna go with the special omelet.",
        "LUKE: Okay.",
        "LORELAI: With a side of bacon.",
        "LUKE: There's bacon in the omelet.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, then skip the bacon.",
        "LUKE: The side of bacon?",
        "LORELAI: The bacon in the omelet.",
        "LUKE: Hold the bacon.",
        "LORELAI: Can I get Jack cheese?",
        "LUKE: On the side?",
        "LORELAI: Instead of Swiss, Swiss is so stringy.",
        "LUKE: Fine, Jack cheese.",
        "LORELAI: Also, I think I'm allergic to oregano so hold that, too, and some coffee.",
        "LUKE: So, just the eggs, tomatoes, and Jack cheese.",
        "LORELAI: Not too many tomatoes.",
        "LUKE: Light on the tomatoes.",
        "LORELAI: Very light, just a teeny-tiny amount, practically none.",
        "LUKE: I'm skipping the tomatoes. It's an omelet with Jack cheese.",
        "LORELAI: Perfect.",
        "LUKE: You did this on purpose.",
        "LORELAI: Did what?",
        "RORY: French toast for me. That was cruel.",
        "LORELAI: I know. Look how hard he worked on that sign and everything. Look at the handwriting, it's so precise, so determined. It's focused-Luke.",
        "RORY: That's Jess' handwriting.",
        "LORELAI: Really? How do you know Jess' writing?",
        "RORY: Oh, well, I lent him a book and he wrote some stuff in it.",
        "LORELAI: He vandalized one of your books?",
        "RORY: No, he didn't vandalize it. He wrote in the margins, thoughts and stuff.",
        "LORELAI: Like what, like play basketball, eat a sandwich \u0096 stuff like that?",
        "RORY: No, stuff, like margin stuff. People like Mark Twain wrote in margins.",
        "LORELAI: Pilot a steamboat, write Huckleberry Finn?",
        "RORY: Forget it.",
        "LORELAI: No, no, I'm sure margin writing is very common. Oh, hey, you didn't tell me Dean was joining us.",
        "RORY: Dean?",
        "LORELAI: Hey.",
        "DEAN: Hi.",
        "RORY: What are you doing here?",
        "DEAN: I just dropped by to say hello.",
        "RORY: How'd you know we were here?",
        "DEAN: \u0091Cause you're always here.",
        "RORY: We're not always here.",
        "LORELAI: Uh, do you wanna eat with us, Dean?",
        "DEAN: Rory?",
        "RORY: Huh?",
        "DEAN: Is that okay?",
        "RORY: Yes. Oh, yes, you don't have to ask.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, we're three.",
        "LUKE: I did the math. You gonna eat something?",
        "DEAN: Sure, yeah, I'll take the special omelet, I guess.",
        "LUKE: You put him up to this?",
        "LORELAI: No, I did not!",
        "LUKE: Sure. You don't even know what's in it.",
        "DEAN: I'm not picky.",
        "LUKE: So you'll send it back after I make it?",
        "DEAN: No.",
        "LUKE: Right. I'll come back when I've got time for this.",
        "DEAN: What was that all about?",
        "LORELAI: I think it was a little something in your attitude, mister.",
        "CUT TO CHILTON CLASSROOM",
        "[The students are sitting in several separate groups around the classroom]",
        "RORY: So is everything in the materials clear to everyone?",
        "CHIP: Pretty much.",
        "LOUISE: Oh, were we reading these now?",
        "RORY: Yeah, that's why we've all been kind of quiet for the past ten minutes.",
        "LOUISE: I thought it was, like, prayer time or something.",
        "PARIS: Good grief.",
        "MADELINE: I'm still reading mine.",
        "PARIS: What?",
        "MADELINE: I read slow so I don't miss anything.",
        "PARIS: It's not the Bhagavad Gita, Madeline. It's simple instructions for the business fair.",
        "LOUISE: Someone's not taking to Elba too kindly.",
        "PARIS: What does that mean?",
        "LOUISE: Just that Rory's the leader of this group, Napoleon, and you're not.",
        "PARIS: Excuse me, leader? You wanna lead here, you've got anarchy.",
        "RORY: I'm just enjoying the show.",
        "BRAD: Hi, I think this is my group.",
        "RORY: Brad, hey.",
        "BRAD: Oh, you remember me.",
        "RORY: Of course I do.",
        "BRAD: Cool.",
        "RORY: So you're back at Chilton now?",
        "BRAD: Oh, yeah. My psychiatrist convinced my parents that I should face my fears instead of running away from them and my rabbi agreed, so here I am.",
        "RORY: Well, nice to have you back. Take a seat.",
        "BRAD: Paris. Her name is Paris, right?",
        "RORY: Brad, let me catch you up here. There's going to be an intra-school business fair in three weeks. Each group has to come up with a consumer product that's geared toward high school kids.",
        "BRAD: Neat.",
        "RORY: So we pick our product and we make a prototype of it, then we use our imaginary million dollar budget to mass produce, market, and distribute it, and we'll present all of this at the fair.",
        "BRAD: Cool.",
        "PARIS: Hey Brad? Your festive interjections are a real kick in the pants, but we're low on time, so can it.",
        "RORY: That's it. In two days we're going to reconvene and pitch product ideas.",
        "LOUISE: Class dismissed?",
        "PARIS: Whoa whoa whoa, we haven't even discussed business advisors.",
        "RORY: Right. We're supposed to get a parent who's in business to advise us. Anyone score?",
        "CHIP: My dad's got scheduling conflicts up the wazoo.",
        "RORY: No for Chip.",
        "PARIS: My dad's in Hong Kong for the month but he can video-conference in if need be.",
        "RORY: No for Paris.",
        "MADELINE: My dad's traveling.",
        "LOUISE: My dad's in court for the next six weeks.",
        "RORY: Lawyer?",
        "LOUISE: Defendant.",
        "RORY: We won't pry.",
        "LOUISE: I have no idea what he's up on anyway.",
        "RORY: And no one's mom works?",
        "MADELINE: Working moms are so nineties.",
        "BRAD: My mom works. She's a curator at the Hartford Natural Museum.",
        "PARIS: We need experienced business advisors, Brad \u0096 not someone who poses animal carcasses.",
        "MADELINE: What about your mom?",
        "RORY: My mom?",
        "PARIS: Yeah, that's right. She runs a hotel.",
        "RORY: It's just an inn, a small inn.",
        "MADELINE: It's still a business.",
        "CHIP: She must keep books and stuff, right?",
        "RORY: Yeah, but they're really small books.",
        "PARIS: Look, it's not perfect but it's a better option than Brad's mom, the buffalo stuffer.",
        "BRAD: She doesn't stuff the animals. That's taxidermy.",
        "PARIS: Who is this rabbi that encouraged you to come back here? Give me his address, I'm gonna go over there and pop him one.",
        "RORY: Okay, hold it. Now, I don't think my mom is right for this.",
        "PARIS: Well, she's all we've got so you need to do whatever it takes to make it happen, otherwise maybe you shouldn't be the group leader.",
        "LOUISE: A coup d'\u00e9tat, how exciting.",
        "RORY: There's no coup d'\u00e9tat. I'll ask her.",
        "PARIS: Good.",
        "CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN",
        "[Sookie is stirring a bowl of meringue as Lorelai walks in with a box]",
        "SOOKIE: Thirty, thirty-one, thirty-two. . .",
        "LORELAI: Sookie, look!",
        "SOOKIE: Thirty-three, thirty-four, thirty-five, can't look, I'm making meringue, thirty-seven, fine science.",
        "LORELAI: You got a package!",
        "SOOKIE: Thirty-nine, gotta count, forty, can't over-whip.",
        "LORELAI: I think it's your wedding invitations!",
        "SOOKIE: Whoooooo! Gimme it! Ohh, I wanna see them! Oh, you're gonna love these. They're pearly white with this beautiful lavender stripe - . . .",
        "LORELAI: Aw.",
        "SOOKIE: I'm gonna choke somebody by the neck until brains ooze out of their ears.",
        "LORELAI: What, they're beautiful.",
        "SOOKIE: The name, look at the name.",
        "LORELAI: The marriage of his daughter. . .",
        "BOTH: Susie St. James.",
        "SOOKIE: Who is Susie St. James?",
        "LORELAI: I think it's you.",
        "SOOKIE: What am I gonna do?",
        "LORELAI: It can be changed.",
        "SOOKIE: No, and these have to go out in a week.",
        "LORELAI: We're calling right now.",
        "SOOKIE: I am so not a Susie.",
        "MICHEL: Good morning, beautiful morning.",
        "SOOKIE: It sucks from where I'm sitting.",
        "MICHEL: Heartbreak. Lorelai, do you remember I have tomorrow afternoon off?",
        "LORELAI: I remember, big plans?",
        "MICHEL: Yes, my mother is coming to visit.",
        "LORELAI: [on phone] Hello, yes, customer service please, thanks. [To Michel] Sorry.",
        "MICHEL: About what?",
        "LORELAI: You said your mother's coming for a visit.",
        "MICHEL: But I'm excited, I never get to see her.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, I must be projecting. Your mother's coming for a visit!",
        "MICHEL: She's coming down for three days.",
        "LORELAI: Is she staying here?",
        "MICHEL: No. She stays with me, of course.",
        "LORELAI: In your tiny place?",
        "MICHEL: Oh, she's fine with it. I mean, we stay up all night gabbing and watching movies. We have a ball.",
        "LORELAI: Wow, I can't wait to meet her. [on phone] Oh, hello. Yes, we have a problem with some wedding invitations we ordered. Okay. [to Sookie] They're transferring me.",
        "SOOKIE: I heard that.",
        "LORELAI: He's really happy about his mother coming to visit.",
        "SOOKIE: I heard that, too.",
        "LORELAI: Totally foreign to me. [on phone] Hi. Oh great, I'm gonna pass you over to my friend who has a problem with some merchandise she ordered. Hold on one sec. [to Sookie] Listen to me, I've had a lot of experience dealing with people who have screwed something up. You have a better chance of getting them to help you if you don't get all hysterical.",
        "SOOKIE: Okay.",
        "LORELAI: Okay.",
        "SOOKIE: [on phone] How dare you do this to me! You're ruining my wedding! It's the most important day of my life! It's my life, it's not Susie St. James, are you listening to me?",
        "LORELAI: Good girl.",
        "SOOKIE: You better be listening to me! Do you \u0096 look, no, you be quiet, listen!",

        "LORELAI: Oh, hi. Thought you couldn't get here \u0091til later.",
        "RORY: Our Franklin meeting didn't go as long as I thought it would.",
        "LORELAI: Well, lucky for me, more work for you. Here, chronological order, please. So how was your day?",
        "RORY: I got an A on my physics test.",
        "LORELAI: Aw.",
        "RORY: And I finished Candide and I convinced a boy that Paris would probably never attack his rabbi.",
        "LORELAI: So uneventful, huh?",
        "RORY: Pretty much. Mom, um, I know you're probably not gonna wanna do this.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, I will. . .unless it's something that I don't wanna do.",
        "RORY: Do you wanna be the parent advisor on my economics project?",
        "LORELAI: Ooh, Rory, gosh.",
        "RORY: I'm kind of in a spot.",
        "LORELAI: No one else can do it?",
        "RORY: Nope.",
        "LORELAI: You checked?",
        "RORY: Yes.",
        "LORELAI: You double checked?",
        "RORY: Yes.",
        "LORELAI: And no one else can do it so you came slumming after me and I'm your last choice?",
        "RORY: Of course.",
        "LORELAI: I appreciate that.",
        "RORY: I'm totally stuck.",
        "LORELAI: Well, if you're stuck, I'll do it.",
        "RORY: Thanks.",
        "LORELAI: But \u0096 ooh, hey, what about your grandfather, retired business titan?",
        "RORY: What about him?",
        "LORELAI: He'd be perfect.",
        "RORY: But this is a business project and the word business has been kind of taboo in that house since he left the firm. Asking him might remind him of that and upset him.",
        "LORELAI: Or he'll be thrilled that you thought of him.",
        "RORY: Hm, you're not just saying that because you don't wanna do it?",
        "LORELAI: No, I really think he would enjoy helping you. You would be doing me a big favor \u0091cause then I wouldn't have to feel guilty about being so reluctant to help you out myself.",
        "RORY: All right, I'll give it a shot.",
        "LORELAI: Good girl.",
        "RORY: Would you really have felt guilty?",
        "LORELAI: No, but I would've felt guilty about not feeling guilty and you can see how that could just go on forever.",

        "RICHARD: Rory, this is a surprise.",
        "RORY: I was just in the area and I thought I'd pay a call.",
        "RICHARD: Well, how very continental of you. I would hug you, but I have various forms of viscous fluid on my clothing.",
        "RORY: I'll take a rain check.",
        "RICHARD: Very good.",
        "RORY: How's she running?",
        "RICHARD: Ah, she's a bit, oh, obstinate today.",
        "RORY: Well, girls can get that way.",
        "RICHARD: Mm, indeed. So you were in the neighborhood?",
        "RORY: Yeah, and I actually have a little favor to ask you, if it's okay.",
        "RICHARD: Oh, ask away.",
        "RORY: Okay. There's this project at school and, uh, it's for my economics class.",
        "RICHARD: Good subject, pragmatic.",
        "RORY: Yeah, and we have to come up with a consumer product, all make believe, and there's sort of a contest at the end and we sort of need an advisor.",
        "RICHARD: An advisor?",
        "RORY: Yeah, someone who's experienced in business who can come to a few meetings, make suggestions. I mean, I totally understand if you can't do it, but I just thought I would ask.",
        "RICHARD: Well, I'm not sure how much help I could be. I've never actually created a consumer product.",
        "RORY: That's okay, we kids haven't either.",
        "RICHARD: Yes, I suppose you haven't.",
        "RORY: If you can't do it or if you don't wanna do it, I totally understand.",
        "RICHARD: Well, things are a little bit hectic right now.",
        "RORY: Oh, yeah, I know.",
        "RICHARD: And it is short notice, after all.",
        "RORY: Very short, very short. Um, you know what, forget I even asked.",
        "EMILY: Rory, I didn't know you were here!",
        "RORY: Hi Grandma.",
        "EMILY: You didn't hug your grandfather, did you?",
        "RORY: I took a rain check. Well, I better go.",
        "EMILY: But you just got here. We have cookies, would you like cookies?",
        "RORY: No, thank you. Mom's expecting me at the inn. And Grandpa, really, don't worry about it. I just thought I would ask.",
        "RICHARD: I'm fine, Rory. Thank you for asking.",
        "RORY: Bye. [leaves]",
        "EMILY: Ask what, what did she ask?",
        "RICHARD: Oh, something for her economics class. It's nothing really.",
        "EMILY: That doesn't sound like nothing. What about her economics class? Is she having trouble?",
        "RICHARD: No, Emily. She merely asked me to participate in some, uh, project at school and I respectfully declined.",
        "EMILY: You declined?",
        "RICHARD: Leave it, Emily.",
        "EMILY: Why did you decline?",
        "RICHARD: Let's talk about it later, Emily. I'm busy.",
        "EMILY: Busy? You've been poking around that stupid engine for the last three weeks and all it does is spray at you. You're not too busy.",
