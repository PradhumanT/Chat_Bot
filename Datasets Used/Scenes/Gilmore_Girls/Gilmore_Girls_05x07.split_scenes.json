        "After Kirk spills the beans that her daughter is dating Luke, Emily demands that Lorelai bring him to dinner so that they can get reacquainted; although Lorelai tries to warn him away, Luke goes anyway and is subjected to an evening of oblique insults from a passive-aggressive Emily; after Zach announces that he's ready to start going out with Lane, they spend a cozy first date at home after banishing Brian to Lane's bedroom; having not learned his lesson with Emily, Luke agrees to accept Richard's invitation to go golfing, and both men turn a deaf ear to Lorelai's pleas to cancel; Rory gets her story on the \"Life and Death Brigade\" by being blindfolded and whisked away by Logan and his friends to observe the elaborately staged weekend in the woods, and finally, after Logan encourages her to take a risk, to participate in the event's breathtaking finale."

        "LORELAI: Oh, I'm late.",
        "EMILY: I know.",
        "LORELAI: Blame the insane people driving in front of me. They had a \"honk if you love to scuba dive\" bumper sticker on the back of their car, so I honked.",
        "EMILY: You don't scuba dive.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, but I've been testing people who have \"honk\" bumper stickers lately to see if they really want people to honk. Guess what? They don't. I lay on my horn, and this alleged scuba diver slows to a crawl in front of me just out of revenge, and I'm screwed.",
        "EMILY: You need a hobby.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, actually.",
        "EMILY: Come on, Rory's waiting.",
        "(They walk into the living room.)",
        "RORY: Hey, what happened?",
        "EMILY: She honked.",
        "RORY: Oh, another bumper sticker test.",
        "LORELAI: I just thought up a great idea for a reality show. You pull people over who have those \"honk if you love whatever\" bumper stickers, you kidnap them, and you make them do whatever the bumper sticker says they like to do, whether they do it or not. And then you make them eat bugs.",
        "EMILY: So I hear you have a new boyfriend.",
        "LORELAI (gasps): How did you - ?",
        "RORY: Not from me.",
        "EMILY: Don't jump on Rory.",
        "LORELAI: How, Mom?",
        "EMILY: Kirk told me.",
        "RORY: Kirk?",
        "LORELAI: Kirk who?",
        "EMILY: How many Kirks do you know?",
        "LORELAI: My Kirk? Stars Hollow Kirk? Kirk who hasn't started shaving yet, Kirk? How did you find out from him?",
        "EMILY: I called the Inn looking for you, and Michel answered, but he was in the middle of some argument with the horse veterinarian. Then there was a cracking sound and the phone went dead. Then there was another man's voice saying \"hello\".",
        "LORELAI: Kirk?",
        "EMILY: Bob.",
        "LORELAI: The gardener?",
        "RORY: More twists than Oh Henry.",
        "EMILY: He told me something in a heavy spanish accent, all while Michel was yelling at the vet in French -",
        "LORELAI: I'll be, the UN erupts.",
        "EMILY: Then Kirk came on. He was there delivering something. And when I told him I was looking for you, he said you were probably at your boyfriend Luke Danes' house. Now why were you hiding it from me?",
        "LORELAI: I wasn't hiding it.",
        "EMILY: You jumped on Rory when you thought she told me. You were hiding it.",
        "RORY: She did not jump on me, Grandma.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, and I wasn't hiding it. The only reason I reacted to Kirk the way that I did is that he's not in this world, he's in my other world. It's as if I, out of the blue, told you I was having tea with Mrs. Van Uppity.",
        "EMILY: Who?",
        "LORELAI: Hortence Van Uppity, tight bun, lace collar, tiny poodle... fictional friend?",
        "EMILY: You keep so much from me with these separate worlds of yours. It's not right.",
        "LORELAI: I will try harder to merge the worlds. I promise.",
        "EMILY: Well, start now. I want to meet this Luke Danes.",
        "LORELAI: You've met him.",
        "EMILY: Not in this capacity. I need to re-meet him.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I'm sure that day will come.",
        "EMILY: Next week.",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "EMILY: You have a gentleman friend of significance.",
        "LORELAI: Rhett is my gentleman friend, yes.",
        "EMILY: So it's only proper that you introduce him to your mother. Unless he's insignificant; I don't want to meet a passing ship. That's a waste of my time. Is Luke a passing ship? Is he insignificant?",
        "LORELAI: No, he's not",
        "EMILY: I'll get my book and we will pick a date next week.",

        "LUKE: That's it?",
        "LORELAI: Did you hear what I said? Mother, dinner, us? That's on a par with car, test, crash test dummy. Don't worry, I'm going to do whatever it takes to get us out of this. I promise.",
        "LUKE: Why?",
        "LORELAI: What do you mean, why?",
        "LUKE: Let's just do it, get it over with. Meeting the parents comes with the territory. We can't put it off forever.",
        "LORELAI: Oh yeah? My fourth grade teacher wanted a meeting with my parents. She was hit by a bus six years ago. Never got the meeting.",
        "LUKE: Book it.",

        "LUKE: Book it.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. But I'm warning you. If I call and tell her, and then you change your mind and you want to back out, we're going to have to leave the country. And have extensive facial surgery, and s*x changes. Both of us, so that we can, you know, kiss and not look funny.",
        "LUKE: I'm not going to change my mind.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, fine, I'll just call her now (pulls out her cell phone) - oh, whoa, what is happening? Something dark is happening here. It is heavy like iron. Oh, did you feel that ice cold wind that just passed through?",
        "LUKE: Make the call.",
        "LORELAI: I see dead people.",

        "LUKE: This is a house?",
        "LORELAI: This is a house.",
        "LUKE: What a waste! See, this is what causes peasants to revolt. This is how heads end up on pikes.",
        "LORELAI: Open with that. That's a great icebreaker. Now listen, I want you to be careful about your consumption of booze.",
        "LUKE: I'm not going to drink too much.",
        "LORELAI: No, no, no. You've got it backwards, there, Pablo. Ride the pink elephant, baby, 'cause it's your only defense against Emily Gilmore unless you're packing a Kolishnikov.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, yeah. Shouldn't we ring the doorbell or something? (He rings the bell.)",
        "LORELAI: Oh, a little strategy. (Picks up a plant stake and starts drawing in the dirt.) Here's the front door. We're here. Drink cart's here. It's knock, knock. Open the door. \"Hi.\" \"Hi.\" Turn left, veer right, past the couch, we're at the booze. Any questions?",
        "LUKE: Uh, yeah. Shouldn't you get a massage or something?",
        "LORELAI: Take off your coat.",
        "LUKE: It's cold.",
        "LORELAI: No, it's time consuming. Roll it in a ball and have it ready to hand off to the maid. Yeah.",
        "(Maid opens the door.)",
        "LORELAI: Hi, hello.",
        "MAID: Hi, come in please.",

        "LORELAI: Well, I was just \"re-introducing\" you, as per your instructions.",

        "EMILY: Not if Luke wants a tour.",
        "LORELAI (pointing): Oh, okay, well, foyer, staircase, upstairs, dining room, kitchen, weird piano area that we never really named, and right through here is the living room. (She goes.)",
        "LUKE: Yeah, uh, I don't need a tour. Thanks.",
        "EMILY: Well, then, let's go in the living room.",
        "[Elder Gilmore house: living room.]",
        "LUKE: Your house is beautiful.",
        "EMILY: They don't make them like this anymore.",
        "LUKE: I'll say.",
        "EMILY: They make everything out of cardboard now. White boxes with heating vents.",
        "LUKE: Yeah. The art of craftsmanship is dead.",
        "LORELAI: Gin.",
        "EMILY: Do you have Tourette's or something?",
        "LORELAI: I'm sorry. I thought I heard you say what would I like to drink.",
        "EMILY: I was getting there.",
        "LORELAI: Gin martini, please.",
        "EMILY: I already made a pitcher of martinis, but they're vodka.",
        "LORELAI: Vodka's perfect. Double with a twist.",
        "EMILY: So, two cold martinis with a twist, and Luke, how would you like a beer?",
        "LUKE: Great.",
        "LORELAI: Or maybe Luke would like to choose his own drink. That's a thought.",
        "EMILY: Oh, yes, I'm sorry Luke. You can have whatever you like. I've got it all.",
        "LUKE: Beer is perfect.",
        "EMILY: Beer it is.",
        "LORELAI: No, no, she's got everything. She's got scotch, she's got rum, she's got, uh, whiskey, she's got red wine, she's not kidding, she's got it all.",
        "LUKE: Beer is perfect.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, bring him a beer.",
        "EMILY: Here we are.",
        "LORELAI: Thank you.",
        "LUKE: Thank you, Emily.",
        "EMILY: The beer is nice and cold. I almost want one myself.",
        "LUKE: Hey, uh, you can have some of mine if you want.",
        "EMILY: So, how's that diner of yours?",
        "LORELAI: Uh...",
        "LUKE: It's doing great. No matter what the economic climate, people gotta eat.",
        "EMILY: That is so true. And I thought your place was very charming. Nice and rustic. (Lorelai clears her throat.)",
        "EMILY: Do you need a cough drop?",
        "LUKE: She's fine.",
        "EMILY: Where'd your martini go?",
        "LORELAI: To a happy place.",
        "EMILY: Do you want another?",
        "LORELAI: Does Pavarotti want another donut?",
        "EMILY: That's a yes?",
        "LUKE: I'll pour it, Emily.",
        "EMILY: Thank you, Luke. I should go check on dinner. Will you excuse me?",
        "LUKE: Absolutely.",
        "EMILY: Thank you. (She goes.)",
        "LUKE: Unbelievable.",
        "LORELAI: I know, she didn't make nearly enough.",
        "LUKE: I meant you, you're acting crazy.",
        "LORELAI: She's insulting you!",
        "LUKE: No, she's not. Your mom's being great.",
        "LORELAI: What? Were you in the room? Did you not hear the awful things she said?",
        "LUKE: What did she say?",
        "LORELAI: Rustic diner? Rustic?",
        "LUKE: So?",
        "LORELAI: Backhand slang for crap pile.",
        "LUKE: Or she was admiring its vintage feel.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, what was the other word she used?",
        "LUKE: Charming?",
        "LORELAI: Ah, slang for doggie poopy.",
        "LUKE: Unbelievable.",
        "LORELAI: Wait, wait, what was the beer thing? Oh my God!",
        "LUKE: That was nice. I wanted beer, she was considerate enough to anticipate that that might be the case.",
        "LORELAI: The word beer, backhand slang for nitwit juice.",
        "LUKE: You're reading way too much into this.",
        "LORELAI: Excuse me, but I would defer to the Gilmore expert here. I am the oracle. I carry all the knowledge.",
        "LUKE: Well, I would like you to calm down, because you're making me nervous.",
        "LORELAI: I'm trying to protect you.",
        "LUKE: I'm a grown man, and this isn't my first foray into the big city. I've dealt with all types of people in my life. Rich, poor, snobby, proud. I can handle it.",
        "LORELAI: But -",
        "LUKE: And by you jumping in after everything your mother says, makes me look weak. And I don't want to look weak.",
        "LORELAI: I don't want you to either!",
        "LUKE: Well, then, give me my space, okay? Please.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, I'll give you your space.",

        "EMILY: Dinner is going to be as good as it smells, I guarantee it.",
        "LUKE: It smells wonderful, Emily.",
        "EMILY: Thank you, Luke. It's nice to have a kind gentleman in the house.",
        "LUKE: Thank you.",
        "EMILY: So, you're recently divorced?",
        "LUKE: Uh, yeah, I guess. Although, it depends on what you'd call recently.",
        "EMILY: In the last year, you've been divorced in the last year, that would be recent.",
        "LUKE: Uh, yeah. Yes.",
        "EMILY: Terrible, the divorce rate, isn't it.",
        "LUKE: Yes, it's terrible.",
        "EMILY: I'm sure it was inevitable in your case.",
        "LUKE: Turned out that way.",
        "EMILY: I hope there weren't children.",
        "LUKE: No.",
        "EMILY: Divorce destroys children. But, without children, you're only harming yourself. Of course, nowadays people get married for fun. Apparently there's nothing good on TV.",

        "(Rory walks in and presses a button on her answering machine.)",
        "DEAN'S VOICE: Hey. It's Dean. Uh, so, we were supposed to get together day after tomorrow, but I have to cancel - again. One day, I'm going to have one job, not three, which will simplify everything. I hope. Anyway, um, I was hoping we could somehow hook up tomorrow night, I forget if you have something going on, but I've got a three hour window, and I was thinking dinner or something. Maybe we can meet halfway between Yale and Stars Hollow. That probably puts us on the interstate, meaning the six ninety-nine surf and turf special, but hell, I'm a cheap date. Uh, so, not the most romantic get together for us, but something's better than nothing. Let me know. Bye.",
        "(As she listens to the message, she notices an envelope taped to the outside of her window. She reaches out and opens it and reads this note: \"Be in your vestibule at four tomorrow. Blindfolded. The LDB.\" She reaches into the envelope again and pulls out a blindfold.)",

        "[Elder Gilmore's house: dining room.]",
        "EMILY: Diners are generally so filthy. I'm sure yours isn't, but the horror stories you hear. I read that one in Vermont got caught serving roadkill. Do you know what that is?",
        "LUKE: Uh, yeah, it's, uh, dead animals from the street.",
        "EMILY: From the street, from the backyard, fished out of pools. These diners find it and serve it. Again, probably not yours. But the fact that this place got away with it at all is astounding. I guess people who frequent diners don't look too closely at what they're eating out of self defense.",
        "LUKE: We don't serve roadkill at my place.",
        "EMILY: Well good for you. (pause.) I had a friend who ate at a diner once and the next day she dropped dead. Her family considered suing the place but there's nothing to get from these people. A couple of stools and a toaster. But they were sure it was a matter of hygiene and they eventually drove them out of the state. I don't want to tell you what they found when they moved the stove. Would you like another beer, Luke?",
        "[Elder Gilmore house: outside.]",
        "(Emily is walking Lorelai and Luke out.)",
        "EMILY: ... Opiate for the masses. Well, so what? We all have our opiates. For some it's valet, for Luke it's baseball. Whoever I heard say it just happened to say it about what Luke likes. Oh, no! Some workman has left his filthy truck in our clean driveway! Richard must have sent for him.",
        "LUKE: Oh, that's mine, actually.",
        "EMILY: Oh. Well, it's nice. Rustic. I like the color.",
        "LUKE: Thank you.",
        "EMILY: And I like this coat of yours, there's something nice about simple cloth.",
        "LUKE: Thanks.",

        "LUKE: I won't. Thank you, Emily.",

        "LUKE: She never said anything directly bad about me or the diner or anything else concerning me.",
        "LORELAI: She's good.",
        "LUKE: And all I did was thank her. Over and over. She'd hammer me, and I'd thank her.",
        "LORELAI: It's a talent.",
        "LUKE: \"Rustic\" really did sound like crap pile that time.",
        "LORELAI: Come on, babe. You'll feel better about halfway home.",
        "LUKE: Good.",
        "LORELAI: Then the eye-popping nausea will hit you. The rich food mixes with the bitter memories and it all gets worse, and then it gets better.",
