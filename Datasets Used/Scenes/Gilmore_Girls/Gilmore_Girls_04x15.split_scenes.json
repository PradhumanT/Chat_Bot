    "Recap": [
        "Kirk branches out from dog sitting for Lulu into a new canine-centered career; Paris goes into germ-phobic overdrive when Rory gets a cold; Lane gets an apartment with Zach and Brian and faces a frigid reception from her aunt and mother, and an overly-eager, non-stop-talking cousin when she packs up her things and moves out; when they realize that their relationship is increasingly being conducted over email and the phone, Lorelai and Rory decide to play hooky and go window shopping in the mall, where they run into Emily in the middle of a shopping binge meltdown; Luke lends Lorelai the thirty thousand dollars she needs to finish construction on the Inn; after Emily confesses that the shopping binge and bickering with Richard stems from her anger at being ignored, neglected, and made to feel useless by her husband, Lorelai reassures her of how much she's accomplished and urges her to talk to Richard, but Emily can't seem to make the connection with her husband she so desperately desires; Rory and Luke get a peek into Dean's life as a married man, and Luke gets an inkling that something is amiss when he catches Dean's wistful looks towards Rory as Dean unsuccessfully tries to paint a happy picture of life with Lindsay and her parents."

        "OPEN IN LUKE'S DINER",
        "[Lorelai enters with a laptop in her arms.]",
        "LORELAI: Hey.",
        "LUKE: Hey!",
        "LORELAI: [chuckles and reaches for food on plates he is serving] Ow!",
        "LUKE: Don't.",
        "LORELAI: Ohh. [feigns disappointed]",
        "LUKE: You okay?",
        "LORELAI: Well, you hurt my feelings just now.",
        "LUKE: No, I mean you doing okay with everything?",
        "LORELAI: You're referring to my meltdown in the park.",
        "LUKE: It wasn't a meltdown.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, it was a meltdown. They're making it into a movie -- \"Meltdown in the Park.\" Don't worry, it's just a working title. Baz Luhrmann's directing. And the movie Luke wears tights and sings.",
        "LUKE: But you're okay?",
        "LORELAI: Thanks to my knight in shining armor.",
        "LUKE: Ah, well...",
        "LORELAI: I just hope Alec Baldwin captures your rare essence.",
        "LUKE: And slims down a little for the role. I should deliver these.",
        "LORELAI: Can I work on my laptop?",
        "LUKE: Does it make noise?",
        "LORELAI: No, but I sometimes do.",
        "LUKE: You always do.",
        "LORELAI: Thanks.",
        "[Kirk enters the diner with a pink bag under his arm.]",
        "LUKE: Kirk.",
        "KIRK: Luke.",
        "LUKE: What's with the -",
        "KIRK: It's not a purse!",
        "LUKE: I wasn't gonna say \"purse.\"",
        "KIRK: Oh... Sorry.",
        "LUKE: What's with the gay bag?",
        "KIRK: It's a dog carrier. My girlfriend's gone out of town with some friends, and I'm watching Buster for her. And they're girlfriends, not guys. I called the hotel she booked and verified that it's a girl's name on the register with her. Not that I don't trust her.",
        "LUKE: Clearly.",
        "KIRK: Over there okay?",
        "LUKE: Sure. Carol, Danny, Jamie, Sean, Chris?",
        "KIRK: What's that?",
        "LUKE: Just a list of guys' names that could be girls. You want coffee?",
        "KIRK: Yes.",
        "[Luke returns behind the counter]",
        "LUKE: What is this?",
        "LORELAI: Phone cord.",
        "LUKE: I can't have this here.",
        "LORELAI: Don't worry. It's not plugged in to your regular line. It's the fax line you put in a year ago that you never use.",
        "LUKE: You mean the fax line you made me put in to get in fax orders, even though no one has ever wanted to put in a fax order, and I never got the fax machine, like I told you I would never, ever get the fax machine, making the fax line pointless.",
        "LORELAI: Hold on... Let me get on the \"Guinness World Records\" website. [clicking on her keyboard] Yes, that's the most times anyone has ever used the word \"fax\" in a sentence.",
        "LUKE: Just be quick with this.",
        "LORELAI: Man, I love e-mail. Every day Rory and I write each other multiple times. It's great.",
        "LUKE: You enjoy typing to people more than talking to them?",
        "LORELAI: Wrong perspective. E-mail is a return to the romantic days of letter writing. It's pure Dickens.",
        "LUKE: Why Dickens?",
        "LORELAI: It's just when I picture letter writing, I picture Charles Dickens.",
        "LUKE: Charles Dickens wrote more letters than other people?",
        "LORELAI: No, it's just I can easily picture him in his study with his dog and his pipe and his fancy feathered pen, writing [British accent] \"Cheerio, old bean. Have a cup of tea. How's Big Ben? How's the Tower of London, Sister Suffragette? Tuppence a bag.\"",
        "LUKE: Sounds like an idiot. [struggles to crawl under phone cord]",
        "CAESAR: Hey, Luke, coffee?.",
        "LUKE: [struggles back under cord] Oh, this is embarrassing.",
        "LORELAI: I could unplug, but then I'd just have to start the whole process all over again.",
        "LUKE: Or you could just eat here and save e-mailing for when you're...excuse me [A delayed realization sinks in and he walks over to Kirk's table.] You have a dog there?",
        "KIRK: No. Why?",
        "LUKE: Just putting two and two together.",
        "KIRK: Well, it's coming out five. Buster is at home, asleep.",
        "LUKE: Mm-hmm. Okay. What'll you have?",
        "KIRK: Oatmeal, extra brown sugar on the side, and a pound of raw hamburger. [sees Luke's dark expression] Or just the oatmeal will be fine.",
        "[Luke returns to the counter and now Lorelai's computer cord is balanced atop stacked menus. He sighs.]",
        "LORELAI: Voila!",
        "LUKE: This does nothing.",
        "LORELAI: It makes it easier to limbo under.",
        "LUKE: This is my place. I shouldn't have to limbo.",
        "KIRK: [high voice] You still sleepy?",
        "LORELAI: [glances over at Kirk's table] Why is Kirk talking to his man purse?",
        "KIRK: You got sleepy face. You have to tinkle? [realizes he's being watched and nnonchalantlyreaches into bag] Uh, where is that? Just looking for my Lucky magazine, and, uh...ow! [ Grunts ] Paper cut.",
        "OPEN TO YALE DORM ROOM",
        "[Rory coughs then reaches into the mini-fridge.]",
        "PARIS: What are you doing?",
        "RORY: Getting a drink.",
        "PARIS: You're sick.",
        "RORY: Hence the fluids.",
        "PARIS: When you came out of our room, did you use the doorknob?",
        "RORY: As opposed to dematerializing, passing vapor-like through the wall, then rematerializing out here? No, I used the doorknob.",
        "PARIS: For the love of God, I begged you not to touch anything. [Paris sprays an aerosol can over the doorknob.]",
        "RORY: I'm not contagious anymore. Paris, stop!",
        "PARIS: I'm not getting sick.",
        "RORY: That's your deodorant.",
        "PARIS: Then what the hell did I spray under my arms?",
        "[A cell phone rings in distance. Rory goes into her room to answer it.]",
        "RORY: That's mine. [answers] Hello.",
        "LANE: Guess where I'm standing.",
        "RORY: I don't know but you sound a little echoey.",
        "[cutting between Rory's dorm and Lane's apartment]",
        "LANE: I'm standing in the living room of my very own apartment!",
        "RORY: You're kidding.",
        "LANE: I'm waiting for the gas man. The gas man! Isn't that great? I've got gas! Ignore the word. Just focus on the enthusiasm.",
        "RORY: How are you affording this?",
        "LANE: I'm sharing it with Zach and Brian.",
        "RORY: You're living with the band?",
        "LANE: It's totally innocent, I have my own room, and they're gonna sleep in the living room.",
        "RORY: That is so cool. When do you move your stuff in?",
        "LANE: Tomorrow. That is if my mom hasn't sold it all by now. Hey, you sound a little stuffed.",
        "RORY: I've been sick, but it's mostly deodorant stench I'm suffering from at the moment.",
        "LANE: Oh, my God! My first mail is here! It's a Chinese menu.",
        "RORY: Frame it or something.",
        "LANE: I will. I've gotta go, I'll call you later.",
        "RORY: Bye. [glances over at bedroom doorway where Paris is holding cigarette lighter flame under the door knob.] Oh, that's not dangerous.",
        "PARIS: Fire kills germs. [holding shirt over nose as Rory passes by] And I'm sleeping with one of the other girls tonight.",
        "RORY: How very \"The L Word\".",
        "CUT TO LUKE'S DINER",
        "[Lorelai packs up her laptop.]",
        "LUKE: You done?",
        "LORELAI: Oh yes, your limboing days are over, my friend. Thanks for putting up with me.",
        "LUKE: Well, I only fell once.",
        "LORELAI: And gracefully. Bye.",
        "LUKE: Wait a minute. Hold on.",
        "LORELAI: Why? [Luke glances around covertly] You're making me nervous.",
        "LUKE: Just, uh... [slides an envelope over to her] here.",
        "LORELAI: What's this?",
        "LUKE: It's what it is.",
        "LORELAI: [hold envelope to forehead] \"A monk, a trunk, and a skunk.\"",
        "LUKE: What are you doing?",
        "LORELAI: Carnak, although I don't have a punch line. Never stopped Johnny.",
        "LUKE: Put that down. Hide it.",
        "LORELAI: What is it?",
        "LUKE: Open it later.",
        "[After opening the envelope, Lorelai sighs and sits down.]",
        "LORELAI: A check to me for $30,000.",
        "LUKE: Shh!",
        "LORELAI: Luke, this is the money I was gonna ask you for.",
        "LUKE: And you did ask, and there it is.",
        "LORELAI: But I didn't. Not officially. I blubbered an amount to you, and we didn't get to talk about a repayment schedule.",
        "LUKE: It's okay.",
        "LORELAI: Or interest or collateral. I had charts and projections. I wanted to take you out to a nice dinner.",
        "LUKE: So send me a Honeybaked Ham.",
        "LORELAI: But this is wrong. This is not how you do these things.",
        "LUKE: I don't know how to do these things. Will you just take the money?",
        "LORELAI: I'm sorry, we at least have to go over the basics. [She pulls out napkin and scribbles on it.]",
        "LUKE: I don't want to read that.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I'm not leaving until you read this napkin. [She pushes the napkin over to Luke.]",
        "LUKE: Okay. [He reads and edits the napkin.] Fine. Okay? That's okay. That's too much. That's sufficient. [He passes the napkin back to Lorelai.]",
        "LORELAI: Okay, but what about this? [She writes something down and passes it back.]",
        "LUKE: Nicole?!",
        "LORELAI: Hey! I thought we were writing and sliding.",
        "LUKE: What about Nicole?",
        "LORELAI: I need to know her role.",
        "LUKE: There is none.",
        "LORELAI: Luke, if it's joint money, then I should acknowledge that and thank her the next time I see her...",
        "LUKE: You're not gonna see her. Now, can we stop talking about this whole thing?",
        "LORELAI: Okay, but I insist on typing up something legal and binding for this loan.",
        "LUKE: Okay, okay. I really just don't want to talk about this anymore.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. We'll dot the Is and cross the Ts another day.",
        "LUKE: Yes, we'll cross and dot.",
        "LORELAI: I just have to write down one more thing.",
        "LUKE: What! [impatiently] What is so important now? [reads the napkin] You're welcome.",
        "[Lorelai gathers up her belongings and leaves. Luke smiles down at the note.]",
        "CUT TO ELDER GILMORE FRONT HALL",
        "[The doorbell rings and the maid answers. Lorelai enters.]",
        "LORELAI: Hi. [The maid exits quickly.]",
        "EMILY: [enters speaking impatiently on a cordless phone] Gilmore -- Richard and Emily Gilmore. Look, we single-handedly put your restaurant on the map by praising your crab puffs at Eunice Pierpont Pennington's granddaughter's christening.",
        "LORELAI: Hi, Mom. [follows and waves to Emily]",
        "EMILY: [still speaking into phone] Oh, really? You're new there? Because your deft handling of this phone call displays all the signs of a seasoned and experienced hand. [brief pause] Yes, go get Trey. That's a smashing idea. [to Lorelai] Painful hello.",
        "LORELAI: What's going on? [removes coat]",
        "EMILY: You couldn't see the smoke from Stars Hollow? Lettie burned the entr\u00e9e.",
        "LORELAI: Beyond edibility? 'Cause I'm not picky.",
        "EMILY: No, I could not expose you to such a loin.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, if I had a nickel.",
        "EMILY: What?",
        "LORELAI: So you had a burning loin.",
        "EMILY: And now I'm fighting to squeeze us into somewhere appropriate.",
        "LORELAI: Someone to take pity on the loinless.",
        "EMILY: Is that how you're dressed?",
        "LORELAI: Is this a trick question?",
        "EMILY: It's really not appropriate to go out in.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I did not foresee your burning loin.",
        "EMILY: Stop saying that word.",
        "LORELAI: When will I get this chance again?",
        "EMILY: I've seen that on you a dozen times. You really should update your wardrobe.",
        "LORELAI: My wardrobe is fine, Mom.",
        "EMILY: The summer lines are coming out. You should hit a store.",
        "[Richard enters.]",
        "RICHARD: No need for you to hit any more stores, Emily. You've done enough shopping for a lifetime. For Methuselah's lifetime. [to his daughter] Hello, Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: Hi, Dad.",
        "EMILY: I didn't say I was going shopping, Richard.",
        "RICHARD: It's an instinct that requires no verbalization.",
        "EMILY: I was suggesting that your daughter update her wardrobe.",
        "RICHARD: No need to spread your disease either.",
        "EMILY: Richard!",
        "LORELAI: Really Dad, don't read more into this than what it is: just humiliating me.",
        "RICHARD: Ah.",
        "EMILY: I should hang up and let you both starve.",
        "RICHARD: What do you mean, starve? What happened to dinner?",
        "EMILY: I told you not five minutes ago that dinner was ruined.",
        "RICHARD: Did you?",
        "EMILY: Yes.",
        "RICHARD: I heard the word \"loin,\" but I didn't think you meant dinner. [grins]",
        "LORELAI: Eh...This is making me very uncomfortable.",
        "EMILY: That's because you half listen to everything I say. [to phone] Yes, I'm still here. Good, check with him. [to Richard] I think we have a shot at Bastide.",
        "RICHARD: Isn't that a little drab?",
        "EMILY: We love Bastide.",
        "RICHARD: You love Bastide. Why don't we try that place Jason took me to last week? A lot of hip clientele. He pointed out Moby to me. He's that bald musician.",
        "LORELAI: Yep, that's pretty hip, Dad.",
        "EMILY: When did you have dinner with Moby?",
        "RICHARD: Moby was just there. Jason played me some of his music later. I liked it.",
        "EMILY: We're going to Bastide, but don't fret. Maybe the Beatles will be there and you can sit in and jam with them.",
        "RICHARD: Two of the Beatles are dead, Emily.",
        "EMILY: Only one is dead.",
        "RICHARD: No, a second Beatle died just recently. Lorelai?",
        "LORELAI: Could you press the \"pause\" button on this conversation? I really want Rory to hear the rest of it.",
        "EMILY: If we're going to Bastide, you should change your jacket, Richard.",
        "RICHARD: All right.",
        "EMILY: And please shave that moustache, I beg of you.",
        "RICHARD: I want to see what it looks like fully grown, Emily. That was the agreement.",
        "EMILY: Well, it looks like a caterpillar now. In two weeks it'll look like a bigger caterpillar.",
        "RICHARD: Very funny.",
        "EMILY: I'm not trying to be funny.",
        "RICHARD: I will shave it when I shave it. [moves to stairs]",
        "EMILY: [into phone] Yes. Yes, we'll be there. Thank you. [to Richard] Wait! They said they can take us if we can be there in five minutes and order as quickly as possible.",
        "RICHARD: Well it'll take longer than that.",
        "EMILY: Not if we move.",
        "RICHARD: What about my jacket?",
        "EMILY: Doesn't matter. They'll be staring at your moustache.",
        "RICHARD: Emily.",
        "EMILY: Come on. Scoot, scoot. And be thinking about what you want.",
        "LORELAI: Whoa, just one little problem here. Rory?",
        "EMILY: What about her?",
        "LORELAI: She's not here yet.",
        "EMILY: She's not coming.",
        "LORELAI: She's not coming?",
        "EMILY: No, she's been sick all week. I told her to stay in her dorm and rest.",
        "LORELAI: She's been sick?",
        "EMILY: Didn't you know?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, yeah, I knew.",
        "EMILY: [hurries out the door] I'm having sea bass. Think, think.",
        "RICHARD: Mm-hmm. [He shuts the door behind him.]",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "[Lorelai types on a laptop, staring at the screen.]",
        "LORELAI: I knew it. [She dials the phone.]",
        "RORY: Hello?",
        "LORELAI: We have an e-mail relationship.",
        "RORY: Hi.",
        "LORELAI: [gasps] She speaks. She has the ability.",
        "RORY: What's wrong?",
        "LORELAI: Are you okay? Are you sick?",
        "RORY: I'm getting over a cold. You knew that.",
        "LORELAI: No, I didn't, because our once-wonderful relationship -- envy of all the world, more intimate than that of the naked couple in the \"love is...\" cartoons -- has degenerated into e-mail correspondence.",
        "RORY: I'm sure I wrote that I had a cold.",
        "LORELAI: No, you didn't.",
        "RORY: In all those e-mails, I didn't mention it?",
        "LORELAI: All those e-mails? I'm sorry, but you write less than the people offering to enlarge a piece of anatomy I do not possess.",
        "RORY: I could have sworn I told you.",
        "LORELAI: I just reread every e-mail you sent in the past ten days. No sickness mention, but you did share these gems: \"Hey, what up? Is it freezing there, too? Ice.\" And, \"Whew. Pooped.\" Then you added one of those obnoxious hieroglyphics that I can never read that are supposed to indicate you're laughing or smiling or frowning or vomiting. I don't know what.",
        "RORY: That's a typo. I don't do cutesy symbols.",
        "LORELAI: You're not even using verbs. That's not a relationship. Relationships need verbs.",
        "RORY: Well yours aren't much better.",
        "LORELAI: I'm not saying they are.",
        "RORY: I can never get you on the phone.",
        "LORELAI: [gasps] I can never get you!",
        "RORY: You got me now.",
        "LORELAI: Freak of nature. What do you look like. Do you look the same?",
        "RORY: Hold on. My nose ring is itching.",
        "LORELAI: Don't kid. I'm mad and needy, and I ended up going out to dinner alone with my parents, who bickered the whole time about which Beatle is alive and which is dead.",
        "RORY: So, where'd they land?",
        "LORELAI: John and Keith are dead. Paul and Bingo are still kicking. Play hooky tomorrow.",
        "RORY: From what?",
        "LORELAI: I don't know. Whatever you got. I know you're always busy, but let's do something.",
        "RORY: What about the inn?",
        "LORELAI: They can live without me for a day.",
        "RORY: Tomorrow's actually good.",
        "LORELAI: Really?",
        "RORY: There's a newspaper thing, but I can skip that.",
        "LORELAI: Cool! What do we do?",
        "RORY: I don't know.",
        "LORELAI: Mom said the summer clothing lines are out. Want to go shopping? We haven't done that in ages.",
        "RORY: But we're both totally skint.",
        "LORELAI: Huh? We're what?",
        "RORY: We're skint -- broke. It's British.",
        "LORELAI: Oh man, you've learned to speak British. I didn't even know about it.",
        "RORY: You know what I mean.",
        "LORELAI: So we won't buy anything. We'll just window-shop.",
        "RORY: That could be fun.",
        "LORELAI: It'll be like we're in an old movie, y'know? Walking around, window-shopping like Roz Russell and Ava Gardner on Fifth Avenue.",
        "RORY: I'm with you.",
        "LORELAI: Meet me at the inn, 10:00?",
        "RORY: But it's been so long. How will we recognize each other?",
        "LORELAI: We'll wear a rose in our lapels.",
        "RORY: Or dangling from my nose ring.",
        "LORELAI: You're kidding about that, right?",
        "RORY: I'm leaving you in suspense.",
        "LORELAI: Tomorrow at 10:00, Roz darling?",
        "RORY: Till tomorrow, Ava dearest.",
        "CUT TO OUTSIDE ENTRANCE OF DOOSE'S MARKET",
        "[Luke exits with a bag of groceries as Kirk approaches with a mob of leashed dogs.]",
        "KIRK: Look out. Coming through.",
        "LUKE: What's with all the dogs, Kirk?",
        "KIRK: Well, people in town saw how good I was with Lulu's dog that they asked me to watch theirs -- for a fee, of course.",
        "LUKE: What are you looking for?",
        "KIRK: Shh. Come on. [He walks around corner followed by Luke.] It's a game I'm playing with the dogs -- tracker. See, I cut one of them loose, and then the rest of us hide until we get tracked down. At the moment, we're hiding from Snuggles.",
        "LUKE: We are?",
        "KIRK: It helps them hone their tracking skills, and the kids love it.",
        "LUKE: What kids?",
