    "Recap": [
        "Wanting to play a greater role in Rory's life, Christopher settles in for his visit and lets Rory give him the grand tour of Stars Hollow. When his parents arrive in Hartford for a visit, Emily invites everyone to Friday night dinner, which turns out to be an unqualified disaster after Richard nearly comes to blows with Christopher's father over critical comments about Lorelai. In the aftermath of the ruined dinner party, Richard retreats to his study to calm down, Emily makes a plate for Rory in the kitchen and reassures her how much she is loved and regarded, and Christopher finds Lorelai on the balcony of her old bedroom and comforts her by repeating a little romantic history. The next morning, Lorelai awakens with a start, horrified that she forgot to help Luke paint the diner after dinner on Friday night. Grabbing a jacket, she races to the diner still clad in her pajamas, and begs Luke's forgiveness. He shrugs it off at first, but appears somewhat wounded when he realizes that Lorelai was with Christopher the night before. When Lorelai returns to the house, Christopher asks her to marry him and she regretfully turns him down, claiming he's not ready for the responsibility of a family quite yet. Christopher returns to California with the promise of doing a better job of staying in touch. The next morning, Lorelai surprises Luke by having the diner completely repainted when he arrives to open up for the day."

        "RORY: He looks good don't you think?",
        "LORELAI: He looks good.",
        "RORY: I like his hair shorter.",
        "LORELAI: Short is nice.",
        "RORY: Do you think he'll stay long?",
        "LORELAI: Wouldn't bet a lot of money on it.",
        "RORY: Maybe we can get him to stay for a couple of weeks.",
        "LORELAI: Absolutely - by weighting him down with blankets.",
        "RORY: I just want him to be comfortable.",
        "LORELAI: He's gonna come and go as he pleases babe, you know that.",
        "RORY: Yeah, I know.",
        "LORELAI: And no amount of bedding is gonna change that.",
        "RORY: Yeah, but he's never been to Stars Hollow before.",
        "LORELAI: I know.",
        "RORY: Well that means something's gotta be different right?",
        "LORELAI: Why don't you just enjoy the time you've got ok?",
        "RORY: [pause] Yeah, ok. I still think something is different though.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: [coming down the stairs] That is the worst shower I have ever had. Water pressure keeps changing every two seconds. I'm fixing it tomorrow.",
        "LORELAI: Hey you stay away from my shower.",
        "RORY: We ordered chinese food. It should be here any minute.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Good, I'm starving.",
        "LORELAI: Here [handing him a cup of coffee]",
        "RORY: Hey, how's Diane?",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Uh, Diane is ancient history.",
        "RORY: When I met her at Easter you said she could be the one.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: The one to be gone by Memorial Day.",
        "RORY: You're worse than mom.",
        "LORELAI: Low blow.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Can't keep a feller happy?",
        "LORELAI: Oh I keep them happy. I keep them very happy.",
        "RORY: Ok, now. Don't get gross.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Yeah you're upsetting us.",
        "RORY: I'm gonna go study before the food gets here.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: What? Tomorrow's Saturday.",
        "RORY: I know, I like to get my weekend homework done and out of the way by Saturday night so then I can do extra-credit stuff on Sunday [leaves]",
        "LORELAI: Don't look at me.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: She's a great kid Lor. I wish I could say I see more of myself in her other than we have similar left ear lobes, but she's all you - chip off the old...perfect block.",
        "LORELAI: Why the hell are you here?",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Behold the queen of the subtle transition.",
        "LORELAI: Why are you here?",
        "CHRISTOPHER: You're gonna force me to lawyer up officer.",
        "LORELAI: Christopher.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Ok look. I've been making some changes, especially my career and I think I finally have all my ducks lined up in a row.",
        "LORELAI: You're opening a shooting gallery.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: I've been tying up loose ends in my life.",
        "LORELAI: Do they make that much string?",
        "CHRISTOPHER: You know you've always had that verbal thing, quick mind - it's annoying.",
        "LORELAI: So you've been tying up loose ends.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: I don't know how much your dad has told you but I'm on the verge of kind of a big success, it's for real this time. I've got a company with an actual cash flow, I've got employees, I've got an accountant for God's sake. He wears a tie and says words like \u0091fiduciary' and \u0091ironically'. I mean it's for real this time Lor.",
        "LORELAI: I would love to believe it is.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: [sighs] Why does your dad have more faith in my than you.",
        "LORELAI: My father hit his head surfing Rincon a couple of years ago. His judgement's a little off.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: So you have zero faith?",
        "LORELAI: I've known you since I was six Chris. You're the guy that crashed his Porsche two hours after his parents gave it to him for his 16th birthday.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: And you were the girl in the Pinky Tuscadero t-shirt sitting right next to me.",
        "LORELAI: Horrified.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Think again.",
        "LORELAI: Alright, having a blast then horrified.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Just listen to me will you?",
        "LORELAI: I'm listening to you. Your life's back on track, I think that's great. And I appreciate you coming all the way out here, for the very first time might I add, to tell us that.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: I didn't come out here just to tell you that.",
        "LORELAI: No?",
        "CHRISTOPHER: [sighs] There's some things I need to do...to take care of.",
        "LORELAI: Like?",
        "CHRISTOPHER: I haven't been enough a part of Rory's life. So I wanna be around more, to be a pal she can depend on. I mean I'm not crazy, I know there's already a life going on here and God knows she doesn't need anyone besides you but...if you give me a chance...",
        "LORELAI: I've always had the door to Rory open for you.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: I know.",
        "LORELAI: You've hardly ever used it.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Well I wanna use it now. Is that ok?",
        "LORELAI: Of course it is.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Good.",
        "RORY:[coming into the living room] Hey, I forgot to ask you. Tomorrow morning I'm going to a softball game, do you wanna come?",
        "CHRISTOPHER: You...play softball?",
        "RORY: [laughing] Uh, no.",
        "LORELAI: [laughing] You? Play softball? Good one.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Well ok, who's game is it?",
        "RORY: It's my friend Dean's.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Dean?",
        "RORY: Yeah Dean. The game starts at 9:00.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Uh, sure. It's a date. [Rory leaves. To Lorelai] She has a Dean?",
        "LORELAI: She has a Dean.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: How did this happen?",
        "LORELAI: Well a single-celled organism crawled out of primordial ooze and that pretty much lead to Dean.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: I need a beer.",
        "LORELAI: Hey.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Yes dear?",
        "LORELAI: [chuckles] There's a lot more than an earlobe resemblance there.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Good. Hey, thanks for the door thing.",
        "LORELAI: Thanks for wanting it.",
        "CUT TO SOFTBALL FIELD",
        "[Luke's pitching and Dean's in the on deck circle]",
        "DEAN: [to batter] You got it, you got the next one. Don't worry about it. [batter strikes out]",
        "CHRISTOPHER: So which is your Dean?",
        "RORY: That's him over there.",
        "LUKE: Ok, we've got two outs.",
        "RORY: And that's Luke.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Luke's the diner guy?",
        "RORY: Yes. We eat there practically every day.",
        "LUKE: Looks like we got out number three coming to the plate guys. [as Rory and Chris sit in the bleachers in front of Kirk]",
        "DEAN: I'd send your boys a little farther into the field Luke.",
        "LUKE: Why? Will they have a better view of you whiffing?",
        "DEAN: You know, the only way I'm not hitting it, is if you don't have the strength to get it over the plate.",
        "KIRK: The truth of the matter is that you can't pitch [pointing to Luke] and you can't hit [point to Dean]. So this'll be a terrific match up.",
        "LUKE: Knock it off Kirk.",
        "KIRK: A historic lack of action.",
        "LUKE: Don't you have anything better to do with your Saturdays?",
        "KIRK: What can I say, I'm addicted to comedy. [to Rory and Chris] Half an hour they been playing and it's tied zero - zero. [louder] Hey if you ever take this show on the road I got a name for you, zero and zero. Dean Zero and Luke Zero - get it?",
        "LUKE: Doesn't even resemble clever.",
        "KIRK: I'm dumbing it down for you Alfalfa.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: How long do these games last?",
        "RORY: Till they get tired. And then they say the first team to get a run wins.",
        "KIRK: Yeah, it's real professional down there. Hey Luke, does your husband play softball too?",
        "LUKE: Alright that's it. [starts for the bleachers]",
        "KIRK: Um...I'm getting a page. I've gotta go. [jumps off the bleachers and starts running.]",
        "[Dean comes over to Rory]",
        "DEAN: Hey.",
        "RORY: Hey. Dean this is my dad. Dad, this is Dean.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Dean.",
        "DEAN: Uh, nice to meet you.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Same here.",
        "DEAN: So do you live in the area?",
        "CHRISTOPHER: No I had some time so I rode my bike out from Berkley.",
        "DEAN: Really? What do you got?",
        "RORY: [proudly] It's a 2000 Indian.",
        "DEAN: I got an '86 Suzuki.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Nice!",
        "DEAN: Yeah.",
        "LUKE: Dean come on!",
        "DEAN: I gotta go. [to Rory] I'll see you later. [to Christopher] I was nice meeting you. [runs onto the field]",
        "CHRISTOPHER: So that was a Dean?",
        "RORY: That was a Dean?",
        "DEAN: [to Luke] Hey, uh, next run wins alright?",
        "LUKE: [sighs] Yeah alright.",
        "CUT TO INN KITCHEN",
        "[Michel and Sookie are laughing as Lorelai enters]",
        "LORELAI: Wow!",
        "SOOKIE: Wow what?",
        "LORELAI: Wow! I have never seen you two enjoy a pleasant moment together.",
        "SOOKIE: Oh come on.",
        "MICHEL: Oh you have seen us enjoy a pleasant moment!",
        "LORELAI: No, not ever.",
        "MICHEL: Oh you are being absurd.",
        "SOOKIE: You have to admit, they are few and far between.",
        "MICHEL: Through not fault of mine.",
        "LORELAI: I'm just saying, it's refreshing you know? It's not the usual \u0091Grr' that's all.",
        "SOOKIE: Through no fault of yours? I'm sorry, but you're the one that's so...I don't know.",
        "MICHEL: Oh I think you do otherwise you wouldn't have started saying it.",
        "SOOKIE: Just yourself - caustic.",
        "MICHEL: You mean obnoxious.",
        "SOOKIE: You're words not mine.",
        "MICHEL: Go to hell [leaves]",
        "LORELAI: Oh no, I'm just saying it's refreshing to see you two just - oh yeah.",
        "SOOKIE: You - get in here and tell me the happenings at home.",
        "LORELAI: I'm assuming you mean \u0091did we get our toaster fixed' and no, it's been cold pop-tarts for a week, it's like a damn Dicken's novel.",
        "SOOKIE: I'm not talking about the toaster, I'm talking about the man.",
        "LORELAI: Ah.",
        "SOOKIE: So what's it like having him around the house all the time?",
        "LORELAI: Well it's, um, a little weird. We have fewer clean towels than usual.",
        "SOOKIE: Come on give me something. Tell me how you feel, I'm dying here.",
        "LORELAI: Honestly, I've been trying to figure out how this makes me feel since he asked me to take off my shirt the other day.",
        "SOOKIE: Excuse me?",
        "LORELAI: No, it was a - kind of a \u0091hello' kind of thing.",
        "SOOKIE: Wow. He's smooth.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah. I mean I have not seen this man since last Christmas right. We hear from him maybe once a week - maybe. And then all of a sudden he's here in my town and Rory's running around all excited and he's sleeping on the couch and I'm thinking \u0091should I be mad, should I send him to a hotel' but then he smiles and it's...Christopher.",
        "SOOKIE: Here. [handing her a biscotti]",
        "LORELAI: I mean not matter how many years go by, no matter how long I don't see him for, whenever I do, it's always...Christopher. What do I do with this? [holding up biscotti]",
        "SOOKIE: Dunk. Go on.",
        "LORELAI: [sighs] This man knows all my secrets. All of my bad girl moments happened with him - my worst fashion choices, my big hair days, the wearing of the Bonnie-Bell lipsmackers around my neck - it was all with Christopher.",
        "SOOKIE: So do you think you two will -",
        "LORELAI: No.",
        "SOOKIE: Oh well that's convincing.",
        "LORELAI: I don't know I - he wants to be involved with Rory. He wants to spend more time with her, be a pal.",
        "SOOKIE: It's about time.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah that's good.",
        "SOOKIE: Yes.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah - if it's true.",
        "SOOKIE: And if it's not?",
        "LORELAI: Then it's [sighs] Christopher.",
        "CUT TO STREET",
        "[Rory's showing Christopher around town]",
        "RORY: This is the town flower shop. Um, over there is a good pizza place. That's the stationary store and that's Al's Pancake world.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Good pancakes?",
        "RORY: Oh he doesn't serve pancakes.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Ok.",
        "RORY: He switched to international cuisine a couple of years ago, and dropped the pancakes. He would've changed the name but he had already printed like a million napkins with the original name so he just kept it.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: What kind of international cuisine?",
        "RORY: He kind of hops around. Last month it was his salute to Paraguay.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Anyone salute back?",
        "RORY: Not really.",
        "MISS PATTY: Rory! Honey! How are you sweetie?",
        "RORY: Great. Miss Patty, this is my dad, Christopher.",
        "MISS PATTY: Your dad.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Nice to meet you.",
        "MISS PATTY: You're Rory's father, well, well, well. You know Christopher, we're all like Rory's parents around here and I'm one of her mothers. And since you're her father, well that would make us...a couple. [laughing] A couple of what I don't know.",
        "RORY: Ok, well we've got to be going.",
        "MISS PATTY: Yes well, come back and see me.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: I will.",
        "MISS PATTY: [laughing] Bye. [As Rory and Chris cross the street she takes out her cell phone and dials]",
        "[As Rory and Chris pass the market]",
        "TAYLOR: Well you must be Rory's father.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Uh, yes I am.",
        "TAYLOR: Taylor Doose, grocer to Stars Hollow.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Very nice to meet you. [they keep walking. To Rory] News travels fast around here.",
        "RORY: Yes it does. [behind them you see Taylor dialing.]",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Bookstore. Good. Come on.[they enter. Jackson and Andrew are there]",
        "JACKSON: Hey, hey Christopher! Jackson Melville.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Hello.",
        "JACKSON: Boy I gotta tell you, did they get your description wrong.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Really?",
        "JACKSON: Oh yeah, much more George Clooney than Brad Pitt. Hey Andrew.",
        "ANDREW: Yup.",
        "JACKSON: Don't you thin he's much more George Clooney than Brad Pitt?",
        "ANDREW: I'm going with the Billy Crudup comparison myself.",
        "JACKSON: Really?",
        "ANDREW: Oh yeah.",
        "JACKSON: I don't see it. Well maybe from the side. Hey do you mind?",
        "[Jackson grabs him and turns him from one side profile to the other]",
        "CHRISTOPHER: What? Uh, no, not at all.",
        "JACKSON: Well there's a little Crudup in there. Huh, well it's nice to meet you, whoever you look like.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Nice to meet you. [tugs at Rory as they go down an aisle] Ok, I'm kidnapping you and getting you out of here.",
        "RORY: They all mean well.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, I'm sure all lunatics have the best intentions. Ok, so I hear you like books.",
        "RORY: Why yes I do.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Well I would like you to pick something out and let my buy it for you.",
        "RORY: Dad you don't have to buy me anything.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Come on, what's the book of your dreams right now?",
        "RORY: Well that would definitely be the Compact Oxford English Dictionary, but dad -",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Excuse me - one Compact Oxford English Dictionary please.",
        "ANDREW: Ok.",
        "RORY: Dad no, it costs a fortune.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: You need something to remember this visit by.",
        "ANDREW [bringing a very large and heavy book] Here you go.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Holy mother. This is the monolith from 2001.",
        "RORY: It has every word ever recorded in the English language plus origins and earliest usage.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: You sure you wouldn't rather have a car, they weigh about the same. Here you go. [handing over a credit card]",
        "RORY: This is so nice of you.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, well I've got a lot of things to make up for.",
        "RORY: No you don't.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Yes I do.",
        "ANDREW: [whispering] Uh, I'm sorry Christopher, your credit card has been rejected.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Rejected? What are you talking about?",
        "ANDREW: I could run it through again if you'd like.",
        "RORY: Yes.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Uh, no. He doesn't need to run it throug hagain.",
        "RORY: Oh, ok.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Could you maybe hold that for us? I'll come back tomorrow with another card.",
        "ANDREW: Sure Chris, no problem.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Thanks. Come on. [they leave the bookstore. Outside] Now you'll really remember me.",
        "RORY: I didn't want it that much anyways.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Hey, listen, don't tell your mom about this ok?",
        "RORY: Ok.",
        "JACKSON: [standing with his back to them talking to a group of people] Yes it is her real dad. He seems very nice. Kind of a folky, poppy, urban, scruffy look to him. And obviously there's some money mixed in there because he's got that you know, money nose. And - [someone clears their throat. Jackson turns around and see Rory and Chris standing there. He touches his touque and runs off. ]",
        "CUT TO LUKE'S",

        "LUKE: Yeah she was with some guy.",
        "LORELAI: Dean.",
        "LUKE: No, I know that punk. Some older guy.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, that would've been her dad.",
        "LUKE: Really? So that's uh...",
        "LORELAI: The guy who impregnated me with Rory - yes.",
        "LUKE: Oh, well, he did a good job.",
        "LORELAI: Impregnating me with Rory?",
        "LUKE: Now this has taken a very weird turn.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah.",
        "[Rory and Chris enter]",
        "RORY: Hi.",
        "LORELAI: Oh hi, where were you? [as she kisses Rory]",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Well we saw Al's Paraguayan pancake house, we were stalked by several towns people and apparently I look like Billy Crudup.",
        "LORELAI: You do not.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Take it up with Jackson. [phone rings]",
        "LORELAI: Ah, ah, ah, ah,. Hey, hey, hey, hey. [points to the no cell phone sign]",

        "GRANDMA: Well I had this wonderful idea. Christopher's parents are in town too. You remember Straub and Francine don't you?",
        "LORELAI: Ah yes - the Schnickelfritzes.",
        "GRANDMA: The who?",
        "LORELAI: The Hayden's.",
        "GRANDMA: Well I called them up and invited them to dinner. They said they are free to join us all on Friday night.",
        "LORELAI: Join us all?",
        "GRANDMA: Yes. You, Rory, Christopher, your father.",
        "LORELAI: That's quite a gathering mom.",
        "GRANDMA: Well I should say so. We haven't all been together since the two of you were children. And Straub and Francine haven't seen Rory since she was a baby.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah I know but -",
