        "[Lorelai, Rory and Emily are eating chocolate fondue.]",
        "EMILY: This feels so decadent. Isn't this decadent?",
        "RORY: Very decadent.",
        "LORELAI: Are there more marshmallows?",
        "EMILY: All you two have been dipping is the marshmallows! You haven't touched the kiwi, or the pineapple, or the tangelo slices.",
        "RORY: But it's fruit.",
        "EMILY: Fruit is good for you.",
        "RORY: We're fondue purists, Grandma.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, we dip old school.",
        "EMILY: The government says you should have nine servings of fruit and vegetables per day.",
        "LORELAI: Imperialist propaganda.",
        "RORY: I think Noam Chomsky would agree.",
        "LORELAI: I bet Noam doesn't dip fruit.",
        "RORY: Or laugh. Ever seen that punim on him?",
        "LORELAI: Easter Island.",
        "EMILY: Luminista, please bring more marshmallows.",
        "LORELAI: Bless you.",
        "EMILY: So, I'd love to get your opinion on something.",
        "RORY: Sure.",
        "EMILY: The City Ballet is in trouble. We've given so much over the years, but it's never enough to cover everything they need.",
        "RORY: I hate that.",
        "EMILY: So, we're trying something new. Select patrons, such as myself, are sponsoring individual dancers. Help me pick one.",
        "[Emily opens up a blue folder next to her and hands Rory and Lorelai cards out of it.]",
        "LORELAI: Pick what?",
        "EMILY: My dancer! I get to take one home. Bios are on the back.",
        "LORELAI: And this is legal?",
        "EMILY: Of course it's legal.",
        "RORY [shrugs]: Do you want a boy or a girl, Grandma?",
        "EMILY: I'm thinking a little girl. Cute and petite.",
        "RORY: They're all petite.",
        "LORELAI: But not all cute. This one should fouetter over to the dermatologist.",
        "EMILY: Oh, yes, I'd rather not look at that.",
        "LORELAI: Really, Mom, this is a little bit creepy.",
        "EMILY: It's not creepy! We're endowing dancers so that they don't have to worry about money. It's nice.",
        "LORELAI: Well, Gregorio here looks pretty well-endowed already. [She passes his card to Rory.]",
        "RORY: Here's a little cutie patootie. [She passes the card to Emily.]",
        "EMILY: Oh, she's darling! Look at those little feet!",
        "RORY [to Lorelai]: Whoa, you were right! This Gregorio guy, what's up with that?",
        "EMILY: Rory!",
        "LORELAI: Just a little girl talk, Mom. Who are we offending?",
        "EMILY: Let's make two piles. One for the maybes, one for the nos.",
        "LORELAI: Sandpaper face is a no?",
        "EMILY: Definitely.",
        "RORY: What about Endowment Boy?",
        "EMILY [pause]: The maybes.",
        "RORY: You go, Grandma.",

        "[Rory and Lorelai are transferring boxes from Rory's trunk to the back of Lorelai's Jeep.]",
        "LORELAI: I don't know. Adopting a ballet dancer? The whole thing sounds very shady.",
        "RORY: It's good to support the arts any way we can, even the shady-sounding ways. Hey, you took my book bag! I need that!",
        "LORELAI: Oops, sorry. [She pulls the book bag out of her Jeep.] So you really think that transferring your stuff bit by bit like this is the way to go, huh? Easier than renting something, doing it all at once?",
        "RORY: Oh, you really want to re-live the U-haul incident of May 2004?",
        "LORELAI [indignant]: Ah! You make one iffy u-turn.",
        "RORY: We were in a tunnel!",
        "LORELAI: A wide tunnel.",
        "RORY: Going the wrong way down a one-way street.",
        "LORELAI: They don't let you forget.",
        "RORY: Yeah, I've got that elephant's memory when it comes to nearly dying. Hey, you took my book bag again!",
        "LORELAI: Ah!",
        "RORY: So, hey. Let's finalize our plans for Thursday.",
        "LORELAI: Right. So Jackson says that Sookie has been napping between eleven and twelve-thirty every day. We can count on it.",
        "RORY: Must be nice to nap without feeling guilty.",
        "LORELAI: Get pregnant and you'll have an excuse.",
        "RORY: No thanks.",
        "LORELAI: So, meet me at their house at noon. Bring decorations and she'll wake up to a nice, fun, surprise baby shower.",
        "RORY: You got it.",
        "LORELAI: I think it's cool we waited this long to throw it. She's totally not going to expect it.",
        "RORY: Plus we forgot.",
        "LORELAI: But only we know that.",
        "RORY: And I'm not telling.",
        "LORELAI: Good. Bye, hon.",
        "[They kiss on the cheek. Rory closes her trunk.]",

        "[Kirk is sitting at one of the tables.]",
        "KIRK: Luke, can I have a word with you?",
        "LUKE: Yes.",
        "KIRK: You overcharged me for the toast. It's only supposed to be a dollar.",
        "LUKE: I didn't overcharge you, Kirk. I raised the price of wheat toast. It's a dollar ten.",
        "KIRK: You're kidding.",
        "LUKE: I don't do toast humor.",
        "KIRK: A dollar ten from a dollar? That's a ten percent bump.",
        "LUKE: It's a dime, Kirk.",
        "KIRK: I could refuse to pay.",
        "LUKE: Then I'll steal your bike.",
        "KIRK: That's never worked before.",
        "LUKE: I haven't raised the price of my toast in seven years, Kirk. It's still a bargain.",
        "KIRK: I'll give you a dollar four.",
        "LUKE: No.",
        "KIRK: A dollar five. That's my last offer.",
        "LUKE: Do I look like E-bay?",
        "KIRK: I take my toast dry. Isn't there a butter and jam discount?",
        "LUKE: No.",
        "KIRK: What about your chairs? I'm light, and I tend to plop my butt directly on the chair without sliding, so there's practically no wear and tear.",
        "LUKE: There's no discount for direct butt-plopping.",
        "KIRK: What about -",
        "LUKE: Fine. A dollar five. It's a dollar five. You got it.",
        "KIRK: Thanks. That's very nice of you.",
        "[Lorelai enters.]",
        "LORELAI: Hey!",
        "[They kiss.]",
        "LUKE: You raise something from a dollar to a dollar ten, is that such a big deal?",
        "LORELAI: Well, that's ten percent, so percentage-wise it's not so tiny -",
        "[Luke and Kirk gesture at each other.]",
        "LORELAI: Did I step into something here?",
        "LUKE: You know, I shouldn't have gotten into a business that involves dealing with people. [He points at Kirk above his head.]",
        "LORELAI: Hey. [She holds up a magazine.]",
        "LUKE: Hey! Your cover!",
        "LORELAI: I got an advance copy!",
        "LUKE: Oh, look at the inn! It looks beautiful.",
        "LORELAI: I know.",
        "LUKE: I've got to get a new pair of pants.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. That didn't exactly follow.",
        "LUKE: You know, for the party they're going to throw you.",
        "LORELAI: You don't need new pants. You just need pants. And the party's in New York, so you may not even need pants.",
        "LUKE: I've got to get a copy.",
        "LORELAI [hands him a copy]: You've got a connection.",
        "LUKE: I want to get a bunch, though. Frame one or two of them. How's the article? What's it say?",
        "LORELAI: It was then, sadly, that I discovered Luke could not read.",
        "LUKE: You know what I mean.",
        "LORELAI: People are going to think I wrote it. I mean, it's big. I nearly cried when I read it.",
        "LUKE: Good.",
        "LORELAI: And the fact that when Emily Gilmore reads it, she's going to hire men to attack me with tire irons, well, that's something else altogether.",
        "LUKE: What'd they put in?",
        "LORELAI: Not every heinous thing I said about her, but enough. I mean, it's good stuff, it's funny. Maybe if I just told them not the face.",
        "LUKE: Who?",
        "LORELAI: The guys, with the tire irons.",
        "LUKE: I think you should just show it to her and get it over with.",
        "LORELAI: Mm, maybe. Yeah. You're probably right.",
        "[The phone rings. Caesar picks it up.]",
        "CAESAR: Hello. [Pause] Hold on. [He presses the phone to his chest.] Hey, Luke, it's for you. It's Taylor.",
        "LORELAI: Caesar! You just broke Luke's standing 'when Taylor calls I'm out even if he can see me through the stupid connecting window' rule.",
        "[Taylor gestures excitedly through the window.]",
        "CAESAR: I can tell him you're out, and that Duke, your evil identical twin is in town.",
        "LUKE: No, no. I'll take it. I actually have to discuss something with him. [He takes the phone.] Hello.",
        "TAYLOR: Luke! Hey, buddy!",
        "LUKE: Hey. Buddy.",
        "TAYLOR: So the powers that be have signed off on you purchasing the Twickham house! All that's left is dotting the i's and crossing the t's.",
        "LUKE [calmly]: Okay. Fine.",
        "TAYLOR: Ooh, sorry. Lorelai's there, can't talk now, right?",
        "LUKE: Pretty much.",
        "TAYLOR: You know I'm a bit of a romantic, Luke. The thought of you buying this house for your burgeoning family is quite touching. I almost tear up. Heh. Adds to the tax base, too.",
        "LUKE: Well, good. Talk to you later.",
        "TAYLOR: Goodbye!",
        "[They hang up.]",
        "LORELAI: Wow. You and Taylor seem to be getting on very well these days.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, well. He's been cooperating with me on certain matters.",
        "KIRK [at a table]: Luke! I think the sales tax is off by a penny! In fact, I'm sure of it. I'm ready to go to the mat on this one.",
        "LUKE [to Lorelai]: Those guys with the tire irons. Where did your mother get them?",
        "LORELAI: The D.A.R. And they don't work for outsiders.",
        "LUKE [sighs]: Show me the penny, Kirk.",

        "RORY: I hear that.",
        "[She hands off her last file to a man rushing down the hall.]",
        "MAN: Thank you!",
        "RORY: Oh, Patel. Charlie wants to see you.",
        "PATEL: You remember Audrey?",
        "RORY: I can.",
        "PATEL: Give her this.",

        "LOGAN: Hey, Ace!",
        "RORY: Hey! You're early.",
        "LOGAN: Well, there's a first for everything. Where's the fire?",
        "RORY: Oh, just south of the ninety-five. It's a four-alarm. We've got Kessler on it. [She delivers the file to Audrey.] This is from Patel.",
        "AUDREY: I'm not talking to him.",
        "RORY: I'll tell him. [To Logan] How did you know about the fire?",
        "LOGAN [laughing]: I didn't. I meant where are you going in such a hurry?",
        "RORY: Oh. I'm at half-speed compared to this morning. [They arrive back at her workstation.] Oh, no.",
        "LOGAN: What?",
        "RORY: I'm gone for five minutes and this place becomes a dumping ground.",
        "LOGAN: I'm loving the totally non-generic feel of your space, here.",
        "RORY: I have customized it somewhat. [She points to a picture on the wall.]",
        "LOGAN: Eccentric uncle?",
        "RORY: Brian Eno.",
        "LOGAN: I was close. So let's go.",
        "RORY: It's four-thirty.",
        "LOGAN: So cut out early. There's nothing going on here.",
        "RORY: We're doing our rough front page. We're picking our leads, our photos. It's our busiest part of the day.",
        "LOGAN: So the people of Stamford don't get their paper tomorrow, they'll turn on the radio.",
        "RORY: I can't go.",
        "LOGAN: I know the boss.",
        "RORY: So do I.",
        "LOGAN: But I know how to work the boss. At least a little. I know he's somewhere in the vicinity.",
        "RORY: Who, your dad?",
        "LOGAN: Can't you sense it? The flurry, the shuffle of sycophants -",
        "MITCHUM: Hey! Someone new. Have we been introduced?",
        "[They shake hands over the partition.]",
        "LOGAN: Jose Canseco, post-steroids. Should be a warning to people.",

        "RORY: Noon on Friday, main conference room, come with your game.",
        "MITCHUM: Good. [To Logan] You call your mother about the Vineyard?",
        "LOGAN: She's on my list.",
        "MITCHUM: Push him on that, won't you? [Rory nods.] I'm going to four if you want to catch up.",

        "LOGAN: You sure?",
        "RORY: Yeah?",
        "LOGAN: Just checking. So what do you think about Friday.",
        "RORY: An excellent alternative to Thursday.",
        "LOGAN: My sister's engagement party?",
        "RORY: Oh, right. I'm going to try. I'm dying to see the yacht.",
        "LOGAN: Well, it's going to be full of Honor's ditzy friends, but the harbor's cool. Try and leave your grandparent's dinner early. They get you every Friday night, why not let me have one?",
        "RORY: You're very one-note today.",
        "LOGAN: Well, I miss you, Ace.",
        "RORY: Well, I'll have more free time once finals are over and summer's here, unless I get that summer job here.",
        "LOGAN: Well, you're probably a shoo-in. My father seems to like you.",
        "RORY: Oh, I hope so! I love it here.",
        "LOGAN: Okay. So, I'll just go hang somewhere till you're done?",

        "LUKE: I'm done!",
        "LORELAI: There's more, I know it! It's germinating.",
        "LUKE: I'm done, I'm at peace. There is no more. [Pause.] Just the smell of Manhattan!",
        "LORELAI: I knew it. There was more.",
        "LUKE: I mean, forget about the smells you can't identify. The ones you can identify are putrid! I mean, if it's not that rank smell of hot dog gushing out of those dirty sidewalk carts, it's the stench of the subway pouring out of the dirty grates! I mean, the manhole-cover steam? God knows what that steam is. You can't get a breath of fresh air!",
        "LORELAI: Go, Luke! Rant, Luke!",
        "LUKE: The whole city is a decaying heap. It's too many people crammed into too many buildings on too small a piece of land. It's an experiment that's failed. They should just give the whole island a push and float it over to Europe.",
        "LORELAI: But after we see Spamalot! Right? I paid a lot for those tickets.",
        "LUKE: I'm fine with an urban environment. But you need land around your space. Air to breathe. [He takes a deep breath.] I'm done again.",
        "LORELAI: I love ranting Luke.",
        "LUKE: Why does this song keep playing?",
        "LORELAI: Because I put the CD player on repeat with my fancy remote in my fancy limo. Hey, do a limo rant. I bet that's a good one.",
        "LUKE: No, that's right they sent you a limo. You deserve it.",
        "LORELAI: And it enabled us to drink and not drive.",
        "LUKE: That's good too.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, I heard there was good food at this party.",
        "LUKE: I heard that too.",
        "LORELAI: Huh. Never made it to the food, did we?",
        "LUKE: I had three peppermints I took from the bowl in the men's room, gave the attendant a five, 'cause it's all I had.",
        "LORELAI: Made it to the bar, though.",
        "LUKE: Yeah. We should've eaten something before we went.",
        "LORELAI: Who knew we'd keep missing the trays?",
        "LUKE: But I'm not hungry. But I'm something, what am I?",
        "LORELAI: You're drunk.",
        "LUKE [laughs]: Right. I haven't been drunk in years.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, have I thanked you enough for escorting me, and being such a good sport and shaking hands with all the big city folk you don't like, and putting extra cherries in my Manhattan?",
        "LUKE: Yeah. You did.",
        "LORELAI: There'll be more thanking. Later on tonight.",

        "RORY [getting out of the car]: Sorry. Oh, it's only a little after noon. I'm not that late.",
        "LORELAI: Well, we have very limited time during Sookie's nap, here. I just don't want to blow it. Hold on. [She notices the bags Rory is carrying.] You went to Doose's for baby shower decorations?",
        "RORY: Well, I didn't know where else to go.",
        "LORELAI: A decoration store.",
        "RORY: Is there such a thing?",
        "LORELAI: Yes. What did you get?",
        "RORY: Um, poppers. Taylor had nine left.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, well, there's ten of us, so someone doesn't get to pop.",
        "RORY: Well, I'll pass on the pop. And there's plates, and cups, and -",
        "LORELAI [grabbing the cups]: Chicks being hatched? That's Easter.",
        "RORY: No, I know, but I figured hatching is birth, so we're right on topic there. Seventy percent off, too.",
        "LORELAI: What else?",
        "RORY: Uh, New Year's Eve balloons with Father Time and the New Year's baby on them. We'll blow them up and cheat the old man side to the wall so we can't see it, and then change the word 'year' so it says 'happy new baby'.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, that's just sad.",
        "RORY: Hey, what's with the attitude?",
        "LORELAI: No attitude.",
        "RORY: You've been Anne Sexton since I pulled up.",
        "LORELAI: Sorry. Think I just slept a little funny. All right. Come on, let's get up in there while we still have the chance.",

        "LORELAI: Oh my God, it's happening?",

        "SOOKIE: It's coming round the mountain.",
