        "LORELAI: Oh my God, here!",
        "RORY: Wow.",
        "LORELAI: With a crunch and a zing and a hm hm hm hm, hello!",
        "RORY: Okay, our house is burning down, and you can save the cake or me. What do you choose?",
        "LORELAI: Well that's not fair. The cake doesn't have legs.",
        "FRAN: So how are we coming here?",
        "LORELAI: Oh Fran, so good. This cake is amazing.",
        "RORY: Beyond amazing.",
        "FRAN: Well, I should hope so. We've been doing this for a 112 years.",
        "LORELAI: Huh. Well, you don't look a day over a 106.",
        "FRAN: No, I meant my family's been doing it for that long.",
        "LORELAI: Right. Okay, well, I'm glad we got that cleared up.",
        "RORY: The raspberry, the raspberry, the raspberry!",
        "FRAN: So, when is the big day again?",
        "LORELAI: Two weeks from tomorrow.",
        "FRAN: Have you picked a flavor?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, I don't know. They're all so good.",
        "FRAN: Well you have to try them again.",
        "LORELAI: Oh no. I've already eaten so many.",
        "FRAN: This is a very crucial decision, young lady. Cake is the glue of the wedding, so you will stand here and eat until you decide.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, if you insist.",
        "FRAN: I do. After all, what's more important then your wedding day?",
        "LORELAI: Well, it ain't Guy Fawkes day.",
        "FRAN: Yes, well, I'll just go and see if there's anything else in the back. [leaves]",
        "LORELAI: Thanks.",
        "RORY: So how was in seeing Max last night?",
        "LORELAI: Well",
        "RORY: No gory details.",
        "LORELAI: Like I've ever shared that part of my relationship with you.",
        "RORY: You've alluded, you've insinuated, you have tiptoed to the brink of impropriety.",
        "LORELAI: Hm, that Chilton has taught you some big words.",
        "RORY: That's kind of the point.",
        "LORELAI: It was really great. I'm glad he's back.",
        "RORY: And he's on board with the whole smallish wedding thing?",
        "LORELAI: Oh yeah. We want fun, we want simple, we want fast. We've been completely in sync, without the slightly gay boy band affiliation.",
        "RORY: Oh, I printed up some sample invitations for you. I made them on my computer",
        "LORELAI: Aww.",
        "RORY: All you have to do is pick out a quote for the front page, and I'll print 'em up. [shows Lorelai the sample invitations]",
        "LORELAI: Okay. Um \"What is love? It is the morning and the evening star.\" Ugh.",
        "RORY: Sinclair Lewis.",

        "RORY: Fine, next.",
        "LORELAI: \"And all went merry as a marriage bell. But hush! Hark! A deep sound strikes like a rising knell!\" What is it with poetry?",
        "RORY: Lord Byron.",
        "LORELAI: Byron and Lewis, together again.",
        "RORY: Okay, last one.",
        "LORELAI: \"We have buried the putrid corpse of liberty.\" Perfect!",
        "RORY: Mussolini it is. Um, can I ask you an ethical question?",
        "LORELAI: Mmm.",
        "RORY: Is it right to be sampling wedding cakes when Sookie's making ours for free?",
        "LORELAI: What is right anyway, you know? Who defines right? And if eating cake is wrong, I don't want to be right.",
        "FRAN: [calls] I'm bringing out a mocha crunch cream.",
        "LORELAI: So, ethics?",
        "RORY: Highly subjective and completely overrated.",
        "LORELAI: That's my girl.",

        "LORELAI: Wow Kirk, I didn't know you were into photography.",
        "KIRK: It's my passion.",
        "LORELAI: Have you ever shot a wedding before?",
        "KIRK: Actually, this would be my first official wedding gig. Or photography gig, for that matter. But believe me, I've got the eye. And my Nikon is state of the art.",
        "MAX: Oh, I've got a Nikon too. It's an N64 with 3D matrix metering, 35 to 210 zoom. What have you got?",
        "KIRK: It's a Nikon.",
        "LORELAI: I gotta tell you Kirk, these are really good for amateur shots.",
        "KIRK: Thanks. That's me and my parents on vacation in the Berkshires.",
        "MAX: Hm, nice looking family.",
        "KIRK: And those are some self-portraits.",
        "LORELAI: Aahh! Kirk, you're nude!",
        "KIRK: No no, I'm wearing Speedos. They're kind of flesh colored.",
        "MAX: Wait a minute. I recognize this.",
        "KIRK: Nice photo, huh?",
        "MAX: This is VJ Day, New York, 1945.",
        "KIRK: Right. I include it as an example of the excellence that I aspire to.",
        "LORELAI: How much for your services?",
        "KIRK: How about a hundred and fifty an hour?",
        "LORELAI: How about lunch and the cost of the film?",
        "KIRK: You won't be sorry.",
        "LORELAI: Done.",
        "KIRK: I thank you.",
        "LORELAI: Bye. [Kirk leaves]",

        "LORELAI: Three.",
        "MAX: I have to go.",
        "LORELAI: No!",
        "MAX: I have to.",
        "LORELAI: You're always going.",
        "MAX: Well, luckily that'll all change soon.",
        "LORELAI: Yes it will. Two weeks from now you won't have to get going 'cause it's here you'll be going. To. Going or going to?",
        "MAX: I'd add the to.",
        "LORELAI: Hm. Going to. You make me smarter.",
        "MAX: Hm, well, I am a teacher.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, hey, don't. Stay longer.",
        "MAX: I can't.",
        "LORELAI: Take me upstairs and see if you can get me into Mensa.",
        "MAX: It's gonna take me forever to get back into the city, and I gotta get up early to let the painters in.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, do you have to be there while they work?",
        "MAX: What do you mean?",
        "LORELAI: Well, isn't your apartment gonna be all paint fumey?",
        "MAX: Yeah, so?",
        "LORELAI: So, maybe you should stay here.",
        "MAX: Here?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah. Instead of driving back and forth all weekend, sleep over. I mean, it's gonna be your place too soon enough. Look at it like a trial run.",
        "MAX: A trial run.",
        "LORELAI: It'll be fun.",
        "MAX: You think you're ready for me?",
        "LORELAI: I'm always ready for you.",
        "MAX: Full time?",
        "LORELAI: I insist.",
        "MAX: He was not wearing Speedos.",
        "LORELAI: Ugh, don't talk about the photo.",
        "MAX: The man was buck naked.",
        "LORELAI: Offer rescinded if this line of conversation proceeds.",

        "DEAN: So, what are we doing tonight?",
        "RORY: I'll do whatever.",
        "DEAN: Well, what movies haven't we seen?",
        "RORY: We haven't seen just about all of them.",
        "DEAN: Yeah, they all stink this year.",
        "RORY: They definitely do underestimate our intelligence.",
        "DEAN: Plus they stink.",
        "RORY: There are at least five of them featuring someone doing something disgusting with a cow.",
        "DEAN: Yeah. I mean, they should at least do something disgusting with a different animal.",
        "RORY: We can watch \"Holy Grail\" on tape again.",
        "DEAN: Okay, but I am not talking in an English accent for the rest of the evening.",
        "RORY: No fun. Hey, tomorrow night?",
        "DEAN: \"Life of Brian?\"",
        "RORY: Max is staying over.",
        "DEAN: Really?",
        "RORY: First time. And to kind of celebrate, he and my mom wanted to go on a double date.",
        "DEAN: But tomorrow's our anniversary.",
        "RORY: No it's not, it's on the twenty-fourth.",
        "DEAN: No, that was our old anniversary. We broke up and got back together on the sixth. So using the twenty-fourth wouldn't be an accurate account of how long we've been together.",
        "RORY: Unless you consider our time apart as a temporary moratorium on our relationship. You know, like the time kept passing, and we were on a sabbatical.",
        "DEAN: Yeah, it's complicated.",
        "RORY: Very.",
        "DEAN: So a double date, with adults?",
        "RORY: No, just with Mom and Max.",
        "DEAN: What'll it be, like dinner and dancing?",
        "RORY: Yes, and then we'll enjoy brandy and cigars. No, we'll probably just grab a bite.",
        "DEAN: All right, we can do that.",
        "RORY: Hey, let's have two anniversaries. We can celebrate twice a month. They're well spread apart, the sixth and the twenty-fourth.",
        "DEAN: We can't do that.",
        "RORY: Who's gonna stop us?",
        "DEAN: Twice a month?",
        "RORY: Dare to be different.",
        "DEAN: Twice a month it is.",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S KITCHEN",
        "[Max is cooking dinner while Lorelai sits at the table.]",
        "LORELAI: Why won't you let me help?",
        "MAX: Because you're a danger to the process.",
        "LORELAI: That's not true!",
        "MAX: I've got numerous scars.",
        "LORELAI: I cut you that one two times, and I've helped you tons of times.",
        "MAX: You helped me twice and both time you cut me.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I do like watching you cook.",
        "MAX: I like you watching me cook.",
        "RORY: [walking into kitchen] What's that weird smell?",
        "LORELAI: It's food!",
        "MAX: It smells weird?",
        "RORY: No, just weird for this house. It smells great.",

        "LORELAI: Hey, it's on fire!",
        "MAX: It's the broiler.",
        "RORY: Wow.",
        "MAX: What fallout shelter have you guys been living in?",
        "RORY: He has much knowledge.",
        "LORELAI: We shall form a cult around him.",
        "RORY: Build a statue many stories high.",
        "LORELAI: We shall grow our hair long and stop bathing.",
        "MAX: Please, don't do any of that.",

        "LORELAI: Ugh, he so jinxed himself with that one.",
        "RORY: Yeah, he should've said 'Billy Jack, I'm gonna kill you or buy myself a lovely chenille sweater.'",
        "LORELAI: Ooh, yeah, either way he wins.",
        "MAX: How many times have you seen this movie?",
        "LORELAI: I'm out of digits.",
        "RORY: You can't see a Billy Jack movie too many times.",
        "MAX: Who's the guy Billy Jack's. . .",
        "LORELAI: Shh shh shh!",
        "TV: 'All right you cats. Very slowly now.'",
        "LORELAI: Let's do some jumping jacks.",

        "LORELAI: Plus you're taller.",
        "RORY: With longer legs.",

        "RORY: He's your fianc\u00e9.",
        "LORELAI: Very true.",
        "RORY: So all you need to do is adjust. It's like that time you got the green stripes in your hair.",

        "RORY: Mom, we're not dying.",
        "LORELAI: No, we're not dying. But the life we had is gonna morph into this like mutation that we could never possibly have conceived.",
        "RORY: Like the giant ants in \"Them\"?",
        "LORELAI: Metaphorically speaking, yes. And I don't want it to be like giant ants, so that's why I'm talking about it now.",

        "SOOKIE: Do you regret any of them?",
        "MISS PATTY: Well, Sinjin was a let down the second time, but he was my Burton and I was his Taylor. Just wish I could've found a little Mike Todd there in the middle.",

        "EMILY: When I wasn't actually with Richard, I was thinking about him. Constantly. Imagining what he was doing, was he thinking about me? Making up little scenarios in my head about how we'd run into each other accidentally at the club. And he would be playing golf and I would walk by and he would be so distracted that he'd completely miss the ball. Silly.",

How very right and wise and honored. This is a very good drink. I highly recommend it.",
