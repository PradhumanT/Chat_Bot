        "LORELAI: Out of our way, peace boy! No offense, love the song. Carry on. Go.",
        "[Lorelai and Rory walk into Luke's Diner]",
        "LORELAI: Ugh. And wuss patrol, halt.",
        "[they drop their backpacks on the floor]",
        "RORY: I've never known such pain.",
        "LORELAI: We are so not walking around Europe with those annoying things on our backs.",
        "RORY: But we're backpacking through Europe. How're we gonna do this without backpacks?",
        "LORELAI: But all the time we've talked about backpacking, I never actually pictured us with backpacks.",
        "RORY: Well, what were you picturing?",
        "LORELAI: Spry, accommodating European men with neat mustaches trailing after us, carrying our luggage, hailing taxi cabs, constantly reminding us how beautiful we are.",
        "RORY: No, it's just the two of us humping our backpacks around.",
        "LORELAI: Well, at least my new walking shoes are all broken in. If you count broken skin, broken toes.",
        "[Luke walks over]",
        "LUKE: Don't do that.",
        "LORELAI: Don't do what?",
        "LUKE: Don't take your shoes off. This is a restaurant.",
        "LORELAI: I don't see a \"No shirt, no shoes, no service\" sign.",
        "LUKE: It's right here, don't do that.",
        "RORY: We're in pain, Luke.",
        "LUKE: But it's great that you guys are bearing it so nobly. And can you move these?",
        "RORY: Can? No.",
        "LORELAI: Would if we could? Debatable.",
        "[Luke moves the backpacks out of the way]",
        "LORELAI: Look at that.",
        "RORY: Spry and accommodating.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, would you grow a mustache and follow us around Europe?",
        "LUKE: Sorry, got travel plans of my own.",
        "LORELAI: Really?",
        "LUKE: Yup, I'm closing down the diner for a couple of weeks and taking Nicole on a little trip.",
        "RORY: Fun.",
        "LUKE: We're driving through Western Canada and then taking a cruise up to Alaska.",
        "RORY: A cruise?",
        "LORELAI: Intimate.",
        "LUKE: I guess. Is it?",
        "LORELAI: [sings] The Love Boat.",
        "LUKE: What?",
        "LORELAI: A cruise is a good spot to get down on one knee.",
        "LUKE: And do my ventriloquist act?",
        "LORELAI: And propose.",
        "LUKE: I have no plans to propose.",
        "LORELAI: You don't now, but after you've had dinner at Captain Stubing's table and Isaac's served you up a couple of mojitos.",
        "RORY: Romantic cruises say commitment, my friend.",
        "LUKE: I am not committing and I am not proposing, so drop it.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, it's dropped.",
        "LUKE: Really drop it.",
        "LORELAI: Did I not just say it's dropped?",
        "RORY: Heard it with my own ears.",
        "LUKE: Thank you.",
        "LORELAI: [sings] The Love Boat.",
        "[Luke gives her a look]",
        "LORELAI: If you'd get a radio in here, I wouldn't have to do that.",
        "LUKE: Okay, so your graduation is Wednesday at four, correct?",
        "RORY: You know, you really don't have to go to it, Luke.",
        "LUKE: I want to. I feel like I've been through this whole Chilton thing with you.",
        "RORY: Okay, good, I want you there.",
        "LUKE: Good. So what do you want?",
        "LORELAI: Are you hungry?",
        "RORY: I'm just sore.",
        "LORELAI: Let's go home and rest.",
        "[they get up and start to leave]",
        "LUKE: Hey, wait, don't leave these.",
        "RORY: Store 'em for us.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, until we hire a flatbed truck to carry 'em home for us.",
        "LUKE: No.",
        "LORELAI: Ugh, my left foot hurts. My right foot hurts. Carry me.",
        "RORY: You carry me.",

        "SOOKIE: What is taking him so long?",
        "LORELAI: I don't know. Luke, come on!",
        "[Luke walks out of the inn]",
        "LUKE: Oh, geez, I walked right into a cobweb.",
        "LORELAI: Aw, aw. So, uh, what's the shape of the place?",
        "LUKE: It was a really big cobweb.",
        "SOOKIE: Terrible. So what's the story?",
        "LUKE: Is there a spider on me?",
        "LORELAI: Suck it up, big guy, and tell us the scoop.",
        "LUKE: It's not so bad.",
        "SOOKIE: So it's not so good.",
        "LORELAI: Not so bad is not so good.",
        "LUKE: No, really, it's not bad. The floors -",
        "SOOKIE: Are rotted!",
        "LORELAI: I knew it. They need to be replaced.",
        "SOOKIE: It's a disaster.",
        "LUKE: The floors are fine. They need refinishing, but they're really nice quartersawn oak floors.",
        "LORELAI: What about the roof?",
        "LUKE: The roof -",
        "LORELAI: Is shot?",
        "SOOKIE: It's caving in.",
        "LORELAI: The walls, too?",
        "SOOKIE: Along with our hopes and dreams.",
        "LUKE: No, the roof is fine. Some shingles need replacing, but that looks like the extent of it.",
        "[Kirk leans out of an upper-story window]",
        "KIRK: Almost done here, folks.",
        "LORELAI: Great, Kirk. You find any mold?",
        "KIRK: You mean, did I find any silent death? Not so far, no.",
        "LORELAI: Good.",
        "KIRK: I did tell you about the dangers of mold, right? And Ed McMahon's dog?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, you did.",
        "KIRK: Suffered memory loss due to mold infestation. Forgot how to sit.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, it was horrible.",
        "KIRK: It's a growth industry right now, pardon the pun. Mold is money. I just wish I wasn't so scared of finding it.",
        "LORELAI: Well, don't look too hard then.",
        "KIRK: Thanks.",
        "LORELAI: So, what's the final prognosis, Luke? We're not buying a money pit, are we?",
        "LUKE: You're gonna spend money, but it's not a pit. Might be a steal.",
        "LORELAI: It's a steal!",
        "SOOKIE: We are such great businesswomen.",
        "LUKE: Once you start work, you can probably have this place up and running in four or five months.",
        "SOOKIE: Which will give the Independence Inn owners plenty of time to find our replacements.",
        "LORELAI: We could be running our own inn in less than a year.",
        "[Kirk runs out of the inn]",
        "KIRK: Oh, ohhh!",
        "LORELAI: What's the matter Kirk? Mold?",
        "KIRK: No, mouse!",

        "[Students are in line to record messages for the video yearbook]",
        "STUDENT: We all knew that our education at Chilton would be exemplary, but it was the people at Chilton. All my friends - Hi Marcy, love you. Cody and Debbie, love you, too. The faculty, the administrative staff. Even our janitorial staff - Jaime and Joachim. I can't count the number of times you guys made me laugh. . .",
        "[cut to Rory and Paris in line]",
        "PARIS: Does she need medical attention?",
        "RORY: Paris.",
        "PARIS: Jaime and Joachim aren't even getting a copy of this. She's maroon.",
        "RORY: It's the end of the year, people get nostalgic.",
        "PARIS: So, how's your valedictorian speech coming along?",
        "RORY: Oh, um, it's okay. Pretty standard. Boring. 'We love the school, blah blah blah.' No one listens to those things anyhow, so -",
        "PARIS: Relax, I'm okay with you making valedictorian over me.",
        "RORY: Oh, good, thanks.",
        "PARIS: Sure. I actually googled the personal histories of Ivy League valedictorians going back twenty-five years, and found some enlightening statistics. They don't necessarily do too well in later life, did you know that?",
        "RORY: No.",
        "PARIS: Oh, yeah. A lot of business failures, crumbled marriages, suicides, obesity.",
        "RORY: Okay.",
        "PARIS: A bunch died in car crashes, several did time, one suffocated when his cat fell asleep on his face.",
        "RORY: Okay, well, thanks again.",
        "[Louise and Madeline take their turn in front of the camera]",
        "LOUISE: Okay, A/V geek, just pan my body nice and slow.",
        "A/V GEEK: Why?",
        "MADELINE: Yeah, why?",
        "LOUISE: Because I'll never look better than I do now.",
        "PARIS: Come on ladies, we don't have all day. A/V geek, I'm going to need six minutes.",
        "A/V GEEK: You're only allowed two.",
        "PARIS: Rolling!",
        "A/V GEEK: Rolling.",
        "PARIS: Fellow Chilton seniors, it's been quite a year. . .",

        "MICHEL: I hate this.",
        "SOOKIE: One guest. In the whole inn, one guy.",
        "MICHEL: And I pulled towel duty today. It's especially awful handling guest towels when you know exactly which guests the towels belong to. It's his mites on those towels.",
        "SOOKIE: Don't be gross.",
        "MICHEL: This is degrading for a man of my capabilities.",
        "SOOKIE: Well, what about me? I've got no kitchen. I'm a chef. My skills are deteriorating. I need to saut\u00e9, emulsify, marinate.",
        "MICHEL: I need more mental stimulation.",
        "SOOKIE: I need to frickin' fry a dead animal in a skillet. I'm going nuts.",
        "MICHEL: I should've been a dancer.",
        "SOOKIE: What?",
        "MICHEL: My mother put me in dance school and I rebelled, I wanted to kick the football. I should not have.",
        "SOOKIE: I've seen you dance and you jump around like a duck.",
        "MICHEL: You know, I'm getting mighty sick of you.",
        "SOOKIE: Not as sick as I am of you.",
        "MICHEL: You know what, you do his towels. I'm not doing his towels anymore.",
        "SOOKIE: I'm not doing his stupid towels. I hate that stupid guy with his stupid newspaper. He's stupid.",
        "[Lorelai walks over]",
        "LORELAI: Yo, guys, no bickering in front of the guest.",
        "SOOKIE: Tell it to Deney Terrio here. I should've been a dancer.",
        "MICHEL: Lorelai, how long can we keep this up?",
        "LORELAI: Keep what up?",
        "MICHEL: We have one guest, half the rooms are still closed from the fire, most of the staff is laid off, I am doing mite towels, and the owner's son is walking around with a bunch of men in suits.",
        "SOOKIE: Yeah, John's here. That can't be good.",
        "LORELAI: John is here looking things over for the renovation that will reopen all the closed rooms so we can be up and running again. Stop worrying.",
        "MICHEL: Okay.",
        "SOOKIE: Okay.",
        "[Michel and Sookie walk away. The phone rings]",
        "LORELAI: [answers] Independence Inn, Lorelai speaking.",
        "EMILY: Lorelai, it's your mother.",
        "LORELAI: Mother, hi.",
        "EMILY: I'm calling to find out how it's going to work at Rory's graduation. Are we going to be sitting together?",
        "LORELAI: Well, hm, hm, hm.",
        "EMILY: Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: Sorry. Hmm.",
        "EMILY: Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: Mom, of course we'll be sitting together. We're family.",
        "EMILY: Well, I knew that. I just wasn't sure if you did.",
        "LORELAI: Well, we're sitting together.",
        "EMILY: Good.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, it is.",
        "RICHARD: Ask her about the gift, Emily.",
        "LORELAI: Dad?",
        "EMILY: He's on the other line.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, sure got the quiet thing down there.",
        "RICHARD: I'm on the upstairs portable, but I'm on my way downstairs. I see your mother now. Hello Emily.",
        "EMILY: Hello Richard.",
        "RICHARD: I'm on my way to the couch and am about to sit.",
        "LORELAI: It's like the thrilling day of radio here.",
        "EMILY: We wanted to ask you about a gift for Rory.",
        "RICHARD: It's a big gift, a little extravagant.",
        "EMILY: But it's a big occasion, so it makes sense.",
        "RICHARD: We wanna buy her a car.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I think that's a great idea.",
        "EMILY: Really?",
        "RICHARD: Wonderful.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, Rory needs to get back and forth from Yale a lot, and the quicker she can do it, the more I get to see her, so it's really kind of a present for me, too.",
        "RICHARD: Yes, right.",
        "EMILY: I suppose so.",
        "RICHARD: Didn't think of that.",
        "LORELAI: Just not a gas guzzler. And no Ferrari's or Lamborghini's.",
        "RICHARD: So nothing Italian?",
        "LORELAI: No, it can be Italian, just sensible Italian.",
        "RICHARD: All right, well, good.",
        "EMILY: I'm glad we had this settled.",
        "LORELAI: Good. Well, maybe I'll see you at the graduation, maybe I won't.",
        "EMILY: What?",
        "LORELAI: See you there. Bye.",
        "RICHARD: Goodbye.",
        "EMILY: Bye.",
        "[they hang up. A man walks over to the front desk]",
        "LORELAI: Hey, you and your Armani posse want something to drink, John?",
        "JOHN: No, no, Lorelai. We're fine, thanks.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. So, I've been lying to people about you all day.",
        "JOHN: About what?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, about how it's not a big deal that you're walking around with a concerned look on your face with a group of men with concerned looks on their faces. I think I've been lying to me a little, too.",
        "JOHN: We have to close off three more rooms.",
        "LORELAI: Three rooms? That'll leave us with two.",
        "JOHN: And, uh, the estimate for the repairs to get everything back to the quality we had and up to code. . .it's not pretty.",
        "LORELAI: No, that's not pretty.",
        "JOHN: Mom's leaning toward selling.",
        "LORELAI: Selling.",
        "JOHN: Nothing's final yet.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, nothing's final. I just. . .Rory grew up here. I grew up here.",
        "JOHN: Yeah, I better get back to my group.",
        "LORELAI: Right, sure, you go. Hey, be careful not to trip over our guest.",
        "JOHN: I won't.",
        "CUT TO SOOKIE'S HOUSE",
        "[Sookie and Jackson are watching television. There's a knock at the front door.]",
        "LORELAI: [calls from outside] Sookie, Jackson, you better not be in bed.",
        "JACKSON: Are you expecting Lorelai?",
        "SOOKIE: No.",
        "LORELAI: [calls] Come on. The night is young and the champagne's cold.",
        "SOOKIE: The champagne?",
        "[they answer the door]",
        "LORELAI: Surprise!",
        "SOOKIE: What is this?",
        "LORELAI: It's a celebration.",
        "SOOKIE: For what?",
        "LORELAI: Sookie, get some glasses, and Jackson, put some music on. Whatever you want, just make it festive.",
        "JACKSON: Got it.",
        "SOOKIE: I don't know what this is, but it's fun.",
        "JACKSON: Let's see. I've got Creedence Clearwater Revival.",
        "LORELAI: Good energy, too hillbilly.",
        "JACKSON: Okay.",
        "LORELAI: How you coming with those glasses, Sook?",
        "SOOKIE: Just wiping off the fancy ones.",
        "JACKSON: Huey Lewis and the News? It's Sookie's.",
        "SOOKIE: Hey, we all have our guilty pleasures.",
        "JACKSON: Herb Albert and the Tijuana Brass?",
        "LORELAI: Ah, fun, festive, that's perfect! Crank it. Okay, I've got some cold Dom for me and Jackson.",
        "JACKSON: Happens to be my brand.",
        "SOOKIE: Oh, I love this song.",
        "LORELAI: And, uh, for Sookie and little baby, uh, whatever-it-is, we've got the, uh, apple bubbly stuff. And cheers.",
        "JACKSON/SOOKIE: Cheers!",
        "SOOKIE: Well, come on, what are we celebrating?",
        "LORELAI: Well, you ready?",
        "SOOKIE: Yeah.",
        "JACKSON: Definitely!",
        "LORELAI: The Independence Inn is closing.",
        "JACKSON: Yay!",
        "SOOKIE: Yay! The inn is closing.",
        "LORELAI: Not closing, closed. We're finished. It's all over. They're boarding the place up as we speak. Who wants more?",
        "JACKSON: Well, did they find some gold in the basement or something 'cause I'm missing the celebrating angle.",
        "LORELAI: You should always celebrate new challenges, and that's what this is.",
        "SOOKIE: A new challenge.",
        "LORELAI: Yes. They'll be some severance pay, then nothing.",
        "SOOKIE: Nothing!",
        "LORELAI: Nothing but exciting new challenges. Cheers!",
        "SOOKIE: The inn is closed.",
        "JACKSON: Well, I guess this means that you guys can focus solely on refurbishing the Dragonfly, getting that up and running. That's exciting.",
        "SOOKIE: Yes, it is.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, I agree. But just drink some more. How're you feeling?",
        "SOOKIE: A little drunk, and all I'm drinking is apple juice.",
        "LORELAI: Well, good, 'cause I've got another little piece of news for you. We can't buy the Dragonfly because I can't swing my share of the money because I no longer have a steady income.",
        "JACKSON: Wow, that is great.",
        "SOOKIE: I'm sorry, was that an exciting challenge too?",
        "LORELAI: Absolutely. Yesterday our lives were boring and predictable. We had jobs, we were gonna start our own business. But now everything is wide open. We can do anything we want because we're not penned in. That's good.",
        "SOOKIE: Yes, that's good. And thinking of those new challenges is a nice way to distract me from the fact that we don't work together anymore so we're gonna see way less of each other.",
        "LORELAI: Which will make our limited time together more enjoyable.",
        "JACKSON: Right. And since I'm your vegetable supplier, I'm losing work, and seeing my wife and close friend way less than before.",
        "LORELAI: Cheers!",
        "CUT TO TOWN MEETING",
        "[Taylor is at the podium in front of a bored-looking group of townspeople]",
        "TAYLOR: That would convert it into a town bylaw, a minor but nonetheless important change from local ordinance, giving us the leeway to enforce charter amendments five and six and grandfathering in previously proposed statutes with no procedural delay. So all those in favor of going ahead of this, say aye.",
        "[silence]",
        "TAYLOR: All those opposed?",
        "[silence]",
        "TAYLOR: People, what's going on? People!",
        "MISS PATTY: Oh, sorry, Taylor.",
        "TAYLOR: What is the matter with you?",
        "LUKE: I think it might be the first time sixty people lost their train of thought all at the same time.",
        "BABETTE: Yeah, Taylor, your voice always makes me think of my grocery list. We need croutons.",
        "MOREY: Got it.",
        "TAYLOR: Moving on. Now, people, I know it's an unpleasant subject, but the deer population in this town is reaching monstrous proportions.",
        "GYPSY: Not this again.",
        "MISS PATTY: He's always going on about the deer.",
        "LUKE: Leave 'em alone, Taylor.",
        "TAYLOR: But they're taking over the town. We need to institute partial elimination.",
        "MOREY: Partial elimination?",
        "GYPSY: You wanna kill the little romping Bambi's?",
        "TAYLOR: People, do I have to detail the problems that these deer cause?",
        "LUKE: No, but you will.",
        "TAYLOR: Lyme disease, auto accidents, plane accidents.",
        "LUKE: We have flying deer?",
        "MISS PATTY: Oh, that's scary.",
        "BABETTE: Yeah. Those ones you can snuff.",
        "TAYLOR: But the worst problem is the crop loss. Dean, hand me the blow-up please.",
        "GYPSY: Hey, Dean, he's paying you for all this, right?",
        "DEAN: Yeah.",
        "KIRK: Really, how much?",
        "TAYLOR: People, this is a randomly chosen but typical landscaped area in the town that was denuded by these ruminant pests.",
        "GYPSY: Randomly chosen?",
        "LUKE: Taylor, that's your backyard.",
        "MISS PATTY: This is a little self-serving.",
        "TAYLOR: It might be my yard. Uh. . .",
        "BABETTE: Might be? Taylor, no one else has a \"Kiss the Gardener\" sign.",

We prayed for its quick delivery, crossed days off our calendars, counted hours, minutes, and seconds, and now that it's here, I'm sorry it is because it means leaving friends who inspire me and teachers who have been my mentors - so many people who have shaped my life and my fellow students' lives impermeably and forever. I live in two worlds. One is a world of books. I've been a resident of Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County, hunted the white whale aboard the Pequod, fought alongside Napoleon, sailed a raft with Huck and Jim, committed absurdities with Ignatius J. Reilly, rode a sad train with Anna Karenina, and strolled down Swann's Way. It's a rewarding world, but my second one is by far superior. My second one is populated with characters slightly less eccentric but supremely real, made of flesh and bone, full of love, who are my ultimate inspiration for everything. Richard and Emily Gilmore are kind, decent, unfailingly generous people. They are my twin pillars without whom I could not stand. I am proud to be their grandchild. But my ultimate inspiration comes from my best friend, the dazzling woman from whom I received my name and my life's blood, Lorelai Gilmore.",

I live in two worlds. One is a world of books. I've been a resident of Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County, hunted the white whale aboard the Pequod, fought alongside Napoleon, sailed a raft with Huck and Jim, committed absurdities with Ignatius J. Reilly, rode a sad train with Anna Karenina, and strolled down Swann's Way. It's a rewarding world, but my second one is by far superior. My second one is populated with characters slightly less eccentric but supremely real, made of flesh and bone, full of love, who are my ultimate inspiration for everything. Richard and Emily Gilmore are kind, decent, unfailingly generous people. They are my twin pillars without whom I could not stand. I am proud to be their grandchild. But my ultimate inspiration comes from my best friend, the dazzling woman from whom I received my name and my life's blood, Lorelai Gilmore."
