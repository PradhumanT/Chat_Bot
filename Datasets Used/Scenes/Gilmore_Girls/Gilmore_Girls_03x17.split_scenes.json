        "[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at a table with papers and books spread out in front of them.]",
        "LORELAI: Okay, let's see. Looks like Harvard definitely has the smallest class sizes.",
        "RORY: Okay, we've got our first entry here. It's a pro for Harvard.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, whoa, whoa, those are not the final official pro/con lists.",
        "RORY: Why? What's wrong with them?",
        "LORELAI: Well, the lines are crooked, the printing's all sloppy. Harvard, Princeton and Yale cannot see them looking like that.",
        "RORY: They're not going to see our pro/con lists.",
        "LORELAI: What if they subpoena them?",
        "RORY: Then I'll roll them up in a ball and eat them.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, a big pro for Yale \u0096 they have 1100 members of the maintenance staff. Clean, clean, clean.",
        "RORY: All three of these places probably have the same number.",
        "LORELAI: But Yale must be crowing about it for some reason. Princeton might only have two.",
        "RORY: Two?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah.",
        "RORY: You think there're a total of two guys cleaning all of Princeton?",
        "LORELAI: Write \"Princeton's stinking filthy\" in big letters.",
        "RORY: Yeah, I'm pretending to write it as we speak.",
        "[Kirk walks over carrying a box of T-shirts]",
        "KIRK: Good morning, ladies. May I interest you in a shirt?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, Kirk. You're not selling your laundry again, are ya?",
        "KIRK: No, these are part of my latest money-making endeavor. I'm going to print daily T-shirts featuring a humorous topical headline of something I witness around town.",
        "RORY: Neat.",
        "KIRK: I got the idea when I read about something a man was doing in Portland.",
        "LORELAI: What was he doing?",
        "KIRK: He was printing daily T-shirts featuring a humorous topical headline of something he witnessed around town.",
        "RORY: Is that today's?",
        "KIRK: Sure is. [he holds up a shirt]",
        "RORY: [reads] \"Babette ate oatmeal.\" Huh.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah.",
        "KIRK: I'm keeping it real.",
        "RORY: It's good.",
        "LORELAI: It paints a picture.",
        "RORY: I can just see her. . .eating oatmeal.",
        "[Luke walks up to the table]",
        "KIRK: They're $14.95. How many can I put you down for?",
        "LUKE: No solicitors, Kirk.",
        "KIRK: How about if I cut you in for a piece of the action?",
        "LUKE: How about I toss the shirts out the door first so you can have something to land on?",
        "KIRK: Got it. [walks away]",
        "LUKE: What's with the lists?",
        "LORELAI: You ready? My Rory, our Rory, Stars Hollow's Rory. . .got into Harvard, Princeton, and Yale.",
        "LUKE: Wow, wow, wow, I can't believe it. I \u0096 I feel like I. . .",
        "RORY: Yeah.",
        "[Luke awkwardly hugs Rory's head]",
        "RORY: Oh.",
        "LORELAI: Oh.",
        "RORY: Okay.",
        "LORELAI: Wow.",
        "[Luke pulls back]",
        "LUKE: Oh, I'm not good at hugging.",
        "RORY: Oh, I thought it worked.",
        "LUKE: Thanks. Man, this is big, right?",
        "RORY: Very big.",
        "LUKE: But what's with all the pro/con lists?",
        "LORELAI: That's how we make our important decisions, you know that.",
        "LUKE: But you know what it's gonna be, Harvard.",
        "RORY: Probably.",
        "LORELAI: But not necessarily.",
        "LUKE: But Harvard's all you've talked about for years.",
        "LORELAI: Well, who knew she'd be wanted by everyone?",
        "LUKE: Hey, which school best teaches how to make an important life decision without doing a stupid pro/con list? Whichever one it is, add it to the pro column.",
        "LORELAI: Do not mock the sciencificity of our selection process.",
        "RORY: I've gotta head to school.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, why go anymore? You're in college. Let's go truffle hunting or something.",
        "RORY: Maybe after I graduate.",
        "LORELAI: All right, but if all the good truffles are gone, don't say I didn't warn you.",
        "RORY: Bye. [leaves]",
        "LUKE: I can't believe how great that is, all three.",
        "LORELAI: Well, they have good taste.",
        "LUKE: Well. . .you know, uh, Jess also. . .well, it's so tiny compared to this, it's gonna sound dumb.",
        "LORELAI: What? Tell me.",
        "LUKE: Well, you know how Jess works at Wal-Mart.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, I do.",
        "LUKE: Well, it seems he was actually chosen Employee of the Month.",
        "LORELAI: Really?",
        "LUKE: I knew it would sound tiny.",
        "LORELAI: No, Luke, that's not tiny. That's really good.",
        "LUKE: Yeah. I mean, there's probably hundreds of people working at that branch, and they singled him out.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, it shows he can work hard and get along with people and all that. You should be proud. Did you tell him you're proud?",
        "LUKE: Well, he didn't even tell me about it. I got a letter addressed to the family of Jess Mariano inviting me down to some little ceremony they're having.",
        "LORELAI: Are you going?",
        "LUKE: Oh, he'd hate it if I was there. You know, seeing him participating in some corporate ceremony like that, being called upstanding and responsible, it would kill him. Yeah, I'm going.",
        "LORELAI: Good boy.",
        "[Luke sees that Kirk is trying to sell his shirts at another table. Kirk quickly pushes the shirts off the table into a box]",

        "[Lorelai walks in]",
        "LORELAI: Hey Sookie, Sookie. . .where's Sookie?",
        "SOOKIE: Down here.",
        "LORELAI: Down where? Marco?",
        "SOOKIE: Polo.",
        "[Lorelai finds Sookie kneeling on the floor next to a cat]",
        "LORELAI: Why are you down there?",
        "SOOKIE: Papaya won't eat, so I'm pretending to eat out of her bowl so she'll copy me.",
        "LORELAI: Sookie, you named the cat?",
        "SOOKIE: She looks like a Papaya, doesn't she?",
        "LORELAI: But it's a stray. You'll get close to it and it'll wander off and you'll be sad.",
        "SOOKIE: I'm keeping my distance. Come on, Papaya. Lap, lap, lap.",
        "LORELAI: All right, we're getting you up here. Come on.",
        "[Lorelai helps Sookie stand up]",
        "SOOKIE: Oh boy, being a cat is hard on the knees.",
        "LORELAI: Since when are you a cat person?",
        "SOOKIE: Well, ever since I got pregnant, I've become very nurturing toward all living things. Jackson, too.",
        "LORELAI: Well, both your bodies are changing.",
        "SOOKIE: Yesterday.. .ugh, it was awful. Jackson moved a table and just kind of nicked this spider. He didn't see the little thing, and just clipped one of its legs. And it was having trouble walking and we were so upset, but Jackson made a new leg for it out of a paper clip, but jamming the clip into the spider killed it instantly. Little Satchmo.",
        "LORELAI: You named the spider Satchmo?",
        "SOOKIE: After Jackson's uncle.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, I'm sure he'll be very touched.",
        "SOOKIE: Maybe if I wore ears!",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "[Sookie holds two napkins up behind her head to look like cat ears, then kneels back down on the floor]",
        "SOOKIE: Papaya! Look at Mommy, look at Mommy, look at Mommy.",
        "[Lorelai walks into the lobby]",
        "LORELAI: Oh, is this everyone from the Edgar Allen Poe Society?",
        "MICHEL: If you mean the I-should-be-sterilized-so-that-my-disturbing-idiosyncrasies-aren't-passed-onto-the-next-generation society, then yes, that's them.",
        "LORELAI: [to guests checking in] Hi, welcome to the Independence Inn.",
        "MR. HATLESTAD: Thank you. We're Jim and Milly Hatlestad.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, I've got you right here. Well, once again, welcome, and let me assure you there are no human body parts buried in the floor of your room to keep you awake tonight. Sound good?",
        "MR. HATLESTAD: I guess.",
        "LORELAI: Room 8.",
        "[The Hatlestads walk away]",
        "LORELAI: The Tell-Tale Heart. That's a Poe story. Did they not get that?",
        "MICHEL: The Hatlestads are not with the Poe Society.",
        "LORELAI: Why didn't you tell me that?",
        "MICHEL: If I had thought to, I still would not have.",
        "FRED: Hi, my name is Larson, I'm checking in.",
        "LORELAI: Poe Society, right?",
        "FRED: That's me.",
        "LORELAI: Good. Well, welcome to the Independence Inn. There will be a complimentary cask of amontillado on the table in your room, and if you're expecting your friends Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether, I'll send up another one. [pause] You said you were with the Poe Society.",
        "FRED: Yeah, but it's just a hobby. We're not Trekkies.",
        "LORELAI: No, no, I didn't mean to imply. . .I mean, you're not freaks, no way. Here, room six.",
        "FRED: Thank you. [walks away]",
        "MICHEL: You might want to stop trying to cute things up.",
        "LORELAI: I hear that.",

        "CUT TO WAL-MART BREAK ROOM",
        "[The manager walks to the front of the room. Luke walks in and sits down in back.]",
        "MANAGER: Hello everybody. Hope you're having a good day today. You folks know we do this every month, just a little get together to honor our new Employee of the Month. Nothing fancy, just a quick \u0091thanks' and a \u0091way to go.' Oh, and there's two hundred bucks in it. I think that's how we got our honoree to even show up to this thing. You know him as a trooper, our Mr. Reliable. The first time this young man sat down on that forklift, well, it was like an extension of himself. And yeah, he's not one for small talk, but this boy's production is out of sight. It's Jess Mariano everybody.",
        "[The other employees applaud as Jess walks up to accept a plaque]",
        "MANAGER: Would you like to say anything Jess?",
        "JESS: Nope.",
        "MANAGER: Well, that's our Jess. Give him another hand folks, and, uh, have a good one.",
        "[Jess walks to the back of the room and sees Luke]",
        "JESS: What are you doing here?",
        "LUKE: [pinches Jess' cheek] I'm so proud of my boy.",
        "JESS: Stop it.",
        "LUKE: Do you have a tissue because I think I'm gonna be emotional.",
        "JESS: I mean it, stop, now. It came with cash, it's the only reason I'm here.",
        "LUKE: Don't forget the plaque. You should hang that over your bed, shine a little spotlight over it.",
        "JESS: I gotta get back to work.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, the forklift's going \u0091where's the extension of me?'",
        "[Jess leaves. The manager walks over to Luke]",
        "MANAGER: Hey. Saw you jawboning with our boy there. I'm Bill Borden.",
        "LUKE: Luke Danes, I'm Jess' uncle.",
        "MANAGER: Nice meeting you.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, so he's doing good, huh?",
        "MANAGER: Wish I had a dozen more Jesses. He's my go-to guy.",
        "LUKE: That's great to hear.",
        "MANAGER: Works like a dog on his regular shift, and if someone calls in sick \u0096 and they always do \u0096 Jess is there even if he's already done forty hours that week.",
        "LUKE: Wow, I am so . . .forty hours? He never works forty hours.",
        "MANAGER: More like forty-five, that's what I'm saying. Good boy, that one.",
        "LUKE: Wait, how is that possible? He's got school, he works for me, it can't be forty.",
        "MANAGER: Well, I can't say I sign every time card, but I'm pretty sure it's at least that. Uh, maybe I'm mistaken.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, maybe.",
        "MANAGER: Oh, thought you might like this. A little keepsake for ya. [hands him an Employee of the Month sign with Jess' picture on it]",
        "LUKE: Great, thanks.",
        "CUT TO MISS PATTY'S DANCE STUDIO",
        "[A man dressed as Poe is reciting The Raven at the front of the room.]",
        "POE 1: Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, \"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\" I said, \"art sure no craven.\"",
        "LORELAI: [quietly to Rory] That Poe was downright funalicious.",
        "RORY: He was a troubled man. He enjoyed a little bit too much of the hmm-hmm. [makes a drinking gesture]",
        "LORELAI: Mime?",
        "RORY: You know what I meant.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, mime. That reminds me \u0096 Yale, best drama school bar none. Put that in the pro column.",
        "RORY: I'm not taking drama.",
        "LORELAI: No, but it means you'll have the best on-campus productions. You'll get to see the next Meryl Streep all goofy and eighteen and doing crap like, \"Hey, name an occupation!\" \"Plumber!\" \"Name a farm tool now!\" \"Tractor!\" \"Hey, I'm a tractor doing. . .plumbing.\"",
        "RORY: That's what the do at the Yale drama school?",
        "LORELAI: So I've heard. Oh, that's weird.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: Over there. [points to another man dressed like Poe seated in the audience]",
        "RORY: A second Poe?",
        "LORELAI: It's like a Poe story in itself.",
        "RORY: The Case of the Two Poes.",
        "LORELAI: The Messrs Poe and Poe.",
        "RORY: Oh, that's good.",

        "RORY: That's Lindsay.",
        "LORELAI: Hm.",
        "[Dean sees them and waves. Lindsay glances at Rory]",
        "LORELAI: Oh, I think she's ready to go to the ghetto on you.",
        "RORY: Well, I don't have a problem with her. She's really nice. And, you know, once she \u0096",
        "LORELAI: Bought you a magnet shaped like Mark Twain's head? Yes, I've heard the anecdote.",
        "RORY: Sorry.",
        "LORELAI: I think she should just mellow. I mean, you've both moved on. What's the problem?",
        "POE 1: But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only that one word. . .",
        "LORELAI: I don't remember The Raven being this long.",
        "RORY: It could've used some editing.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, hey, did you put drama school on the Yale pro list?",
        "RORY: Nope.",
        "LORELAI: Come on, do it, we'll forget.",
        "RORY: I don't have a pen.",

        "NICOLE: Hi, Lorelai.",
        "LUKE: Hey, how long is this thing?",
        "LORELAI: He's got at least five nevermores to go.",
        "LUKE: Ah, jeez.",
        "LORELAI: Do you got a pen?",
        "LUKE: No.",
        "LORELAI: Come on, cough it up.",
        "LUKE: I don't have a pen.",
        "LORELAI: You've got a restaurant. Where's the pen you take orders with?",
        "LUKE: I wasn't anticipating taking orders at the Poe reading.",
        "LORELAI: Hm, there goes your Boy Scout badge.",
        "RORY: Uh, Mom.",
        "[Poe 1 gives her a look, then continues]",
        "POE 1: Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy. . .",
        "LORELAI: Busted by a Poe.",

        "LORELAI: Or complain when he goes back to being Fred Larson, Tampa dentist.",
        "NICOLE: Hey, Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: Hm? [sees Nicole holding out a pen] Oh, you're an angel, thanks.",
        "NICOLE: I'll need it back.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, sure.",
        "RORY: Hm, looks like Nicole's got a little Lindsay attitude going.",
        "LORELAI: Not really. Really?",
        "MISS PATTY: Hey, how many nevermores do you think he's got to go?",
        "LORELAI: We're guessing four.",
        "MISS PATTY: Poor Edgar Allen Poe, he suffered so much. And now we gotta suffer along with him.",
        "RORY: Yale drama, got it.",
        "MISS PATTY: Rory, why do you waste your time on those pro/con lists? It's going to be Harvard, we all know it.",
        "RORY: I know.",
        "LORELAI: If the list says it is.",
        "RORY: Right.",
        "MISS PATTY: When you were six and took my cheerleading class, you wouldn't even cheer for any other school than Harvard.",
        "RORY: That's true. That is true.",
        "LORELAI: Well, then the list will reflect it.",
        "POE 1: And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted. . .nevermore.",

        "RORY: They look upset.",
        "MISS PATTY: Wanna hear the scoop?",
        "RORY: Please.",
        "MISS PATTY: I was here when they both arrived. They got their signals crossed. They were supposed to perform different things, but they both came to do The Raven.",
        "LORELAI: If the Poes start fighting, does that punch a hole in the space/time continuum?",
        "RORY: And throw us into a universe where everything is the exact opposite of what it is here?",
        "LORELAI: Cool. There'll be funny sitcoms there.",
        "WOMAN: Ladies and gentlemen, we have a special treat for you. It'll allow you to compare and contrast interpretations of Poe's most famous work.",
        "RORY: Oh no.",
        "LORELAI: Compare and contrast?",
        "RORY: That can only mean. . .",
        "WOMAN: Please enjoy this second recitation of The Raven.",
        "LORELAI: Do we bolt?",
        "RORY: Do we dare?",
        "LORELAI: At least if I'd brought a flask, we could've played the nevermore drinking game.",
        "RORY: Oh, maybe this is what drove Poe to the bottle.",
        "LORELAI: His own work.",
        "POE 2: Once upon a midnight dreary while I pondered weak and weary, over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, while I nodded, nearly napping. . .",

        "RORY: Well, that was pretty good.",

        "RORY: Well, I was able to compare and contrast between readings.",
        "LORELAI: I was able to nap for twenty minutes.",
        "[The first Poe walks over to them]",
        "POE 1: Good evening, ladies.",

        "RORY: Good job in there.",
        "POE 1: I thank you. Young miss, do correct me, but I heard tell that you are considering attending Harvard University.",
        "RORY: I am.",
        "POE 1: I myself attended West Point.",
        "LORELAI: Wow.",

        "[The second Poe walks over]",
        "POE 2: Excuse me, but I was expelled from West Point in 1831, not 1832.",
        "LORELAI: Oh.",
        "POE 1: No, I do believe it was 1832. It was an election year.",
        "POE 2: It was not an election year. President Jackson was to serve five more years",
        "POE 1: I'm sure it was '32. I'm sad to say it was the same year my older brother William passed away.",
        "POE 2: Okay, that's not right either, Fred.",
        "POE 1: Fred? I don't know this Fred you speak of.",
        "POE 2: Oh, knock it off. I'm tired. [walks away]",
