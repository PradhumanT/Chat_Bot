        "LUKE'S DINER",
        "[Luke is on the phone.]",
        "LUKE: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. You don't? Well, when are you going to get it in? Fine. Two boxes of annular thread silicon pronged boat pads. [Lorelai enters.] A band saw. A wood rack, and a jack plane. Yeah, I'll hold.",
        "[Lorelai waves. Luke grunts.]",
        "LORELAI: Eh? Apparently now we've been married for forty years?",
        "LUKE: Sorry. This stupid boat supply place does everything but actually supply anything.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, catalogues. I love catalogues.",
        "LUKE: It's boating parts. Yes, yes, I'm here! [Pause.] None of them. Man, you must have a lot of room in that place of yours. Yeah, sure. Backorder it. What the hell.",
        "LORELAI: Oh! Look at these boots!",
        "LUKE: Let's try twenty C-clamps, five inches or larger. A box of quarter inch teak buns, marine caulk.",
        "LORELAI: And the boots. Get the boots.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, go check. I'll hold. [To Lorelai] What are you babbling about?",
        "LORELAI: I want these boots.",
        "LUKE: Those are work boots.",
        "LORELAI: They're yellow and cute. I'll look like the Morton's Salt girl.",
        "LUKE: How the hell did you find something to buy in my boat supply catalogue?",
        "LORELAI: Size nine, please?",
        "LUKE: Yes, I'm here. None of them? Well, at least you're consistent. Okay, backorder all of them. Yes, the C-clamps, the teak buns, the marine caulk - [rolls his eyes at Lorelai, who is kissing the boots in the catalogue.] - and one pair of fisherman's boots, size nine. [Lorelai raises a fist in victory.] Of course, those you have. Okay. Send them right along. Uh-huh. [He hangs up the phone.] They'll be here Tuesday.",
        "LORELAI: Aw, you didn't have to do that.",
        "LUKE: Hey, is it okay if I come over tonight and work on the boat a little?",
        "LORELAI: With what? Sheer masculinity and some imaginary sandpaper?",
        "LUKE: I have plenty to do until the backorder stuff gets here.",
        "LORELAI: All right. I thought you were going to spend the evening trying to figure out how to fling yourself down the stairs just hard enough that you won't have to go to my parents' thing tomorrow, but not so hard that you actually die.",
        "LUKE: No, I thought instead that I'd try to find a wild boar to maul me just enough that I'll need medical attention so I won't be able to go to your parents' thing tomorrow, but after some stitches and a transfusion, I'll still be able to make you coffee.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, much better plan.",
        "LUKE: I've started to run the rigging. I just wanted to get a little further on it.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, yeah, that's fine. Rory's spending the night. We're having a Cop Rock marathon.",
        "LUKE: Okay. Here's your donuts.",
        "LORELAI: Thank you.",
        "LUKE: And your coffee.",
        "LORELAI: Thank you.",
        "LUKE: And my final plea to not make me go to this thing tomorrow.",
        "LORELAI: [Pause.] You do not have to go.",
        "LUKE: Fine. I'll go.",
        "LORELAI: I love it when I break you with just the sheer anticipation of a wear-down!",
        "LUKE: Hold on, did you say Cop Rock marathon?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, I got 'em all on tape. [Pause.] Trying to figure out what you see in me?",
        "LUKE: Yep.",
        "LORELAI: Wait'll you see me in the boots.",
        "[She exits.]",
        "OPENING CREDITS",
        "LORELAI'S HOUSE - KITCHEN",
        "[Rory and Lorelai are preparing a feast of frozen waffles, pop tarts and similar food. Rory's laptop is set up at the table and she is burning CD's as they \"cook\".]",
        "LORELAI: Okay, I know I was the one that said I was craving mashed potatoes, but, oh my God, they're a lot of work.",
        "RORY: It's instant mashed potatoes. Key word: instant.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, no, not instant. I have to mix water and butter into it, not to mention the adding of salt and pepper.",
        "RORY: OK The Best of Super Furry Animals complete.",
        "LORELAI: Oh! Plus I have to rip the package open, dump it into a bowl and, oh my God, are they serious? I have to stir the mixture to combine? What is this, the Gulag?",
        "RORY: Hey, do you want the Arcade Fire?",
        "LORELAI: I don't know, do I?",
        "RORY: Yes.",
        "LORELAI: Then yes. So basically once I'm finished with all this manual labor, I still have to clean the bowl.",
        "RORY: And the spoon.",
        "LORELAI: What do I use the spoon for?",
        "RORY: Stir to combine.",
        "LORELAI [Waves her hand around in the bowl.]: Pfft. Right. What do I use the spoon for?",
        "RORY: Oh, my mistake. Carry on.",
        "LORELAI: So let's cut to the chase. How badly do you want these mashed potatoes?",
        "RORY: You wanted the mashed potatoes.",
        "LORELAI: 'Cause with tater tots I can just rip and dump.",
        "RORY: Then stick with your strengths. Brain Master Eno coming up next.",
        "[There is a knock at the back door.]",
        "LORELAI: Who is it?",
        "LUKE [OS]: It's me.",
        "LORELAI: Me who?",
        "LUKE [OS]: Rory, can you just open the door? [She does.] Do you have an extension cord I can use?",
        "RORY: I'll go look.",
        "[Rory exits.]",
        "LORELAI: Hi! Come on in.",
        "LUKE: No, that's all right. I don't want to disturb you guys.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, you're not disturbing us.",
        "LUKE: Well, I'm dirty.",
        "LORELAI: Well, so's the house.",
        "LUKE: And if I come in there I'll see what you guys are planning on eating and I'll want to kill myself.",
        "LORELAI: It just so happens I am making a garden spring salad with three bitter lettuces and a breaded French country chicken.",
        "LUKE [Sarcastic]: Really, you are?",
        "LORELAI: No. So how's the boat coming?",
        "LUKE: Slow.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, well, you should've built a motorboat.",
        "RORY [returning]: Extension cord.",
        "LUKE: Thank you. I'll let you get back to taking five years off your life.",
        "LORELAI: Meh. They were the five where I would've been wearing fuschia lipstick way beyond my lip line, so I wouldn't want 'em anyhow.",
        "[They kiss.]",
        "LUKE: See you tomorrow.",
        "LORELAI: Ten-thirty sharp.",
        "[Luke leaves. Lorelai puts the tater tots in the oven.]",
        "LORELAI: Okay. First course ready?",
        "RORY: Ready!",
        "LORELAI: Let's Cop Rock.",
        "[They head for the living room. The phone rings. Lorelai answers it.]",
        "LORELAI: Hello?",
        "EMILY: I picked up my dress from the dressmaker and it's a disaster.",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "EMILY: I got it home and it's falling apart. I need you to fix it.",
        "LORELAI: Uh, but -",
        "EMILY: I'm coming over.",
        "LORELAI: No, Mom, I -",
        "EMILY: Yes, I need you to fix this.",
        "LORELAI: I'm not the woman who made it. Make her fix it.",
        "EMILY: When a woman gives birth to a crack baby you do not buy her a puppy.",
        "LORELAI: What does that mean?",
        "EMILY: I want this dress to be perfect for tomorrow, Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, Mom, but -",
        "EMILY: It's the most important day of my life, Lorelai!",
        "LORELAI: It's not even the most important day of your marriage!",
        "EMILY: I'll be there in half an hour, Lorelai. [She hangs up.]",
        "LORELAI: No. Hello? Mom? But - [She hangs up.] She's coming over.",
        "RORY: Why?",
        "LORELAI: Because she won't buy her seamstress a puppy.",
        "RORY: Oh, sure.",
        "LORELAI: Something about her dress. Crap, what are we going to do?",
        "RORY: I don't know!",
        "LORELAI: We can't eat all of this before she gets here.",
        "RORY: Most of it.",
        "LORELAI: Sure, most of it.",
        "RORY: But not the tater tots or the pizza tower.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, we'll have to do the evening in two parts. We'll watch one Cop Rock, eat this stuff here, she'll come over, I'll get her dress done as fast as I can, then we'll continue with our evening.",
        "RORY: Maybe we should put it off.",
        "LORELAI: She comes, I fix, she goes, we Rock. Now eat.",
        "RORY: Hmm. [She reaches for a pop-tart.]",
        "LATER - OUTSIDE LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "[Luke is sanding the boat in the garage. Emily drives up. She notices him there, and walks up to Luke. When he notices her behind him, he is surprised and drops the sander, still running, on the ground. He struggles to turn it off.]",
        "LUKE: Oh! Hi, Emily. I just - I didn't see you standing there. I'm just working on my boat.",
        "EMILY: You're building a boat?",
        "LUKE: Yes.",
        "EMILY: Does it float?",
        "LUKE: Not yet.",
        "EMILY: Aren't boats supposed to?",
        "LUKE: Eventually, yes.",
        "EMILY: Well, at least you have a hobby.",
        "LUKE: Yes. Thank God for that, huh?",
        "EMILY: Idle hands, and whatnot.",
        "LUKE: It will float eventually.",
        "EMILY: Oh, I'm sure it will.",
        "LUKE: I just have to do a little more -",
        "EMILY: Well, I should get inside.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, it's nice seeing you again.",
        "EMILY: Yes.",
        "LUKE: Oh! Uh, congratulations.",
        "EMILY: For what?",
        "LUKE: You know, your thing tomorrow, renewing your vows.",
        "EMILY: You congratulate the groom. You offer the bride best wishes.",
        "LUKE: Oh. [Pause.] Uh, best wishes.",
        "EMILY: Why, thank you, Luke. How sweet of you to say. I'll see you tomorrow.",
        "LUKE: Hey, I'm looking forward to it.",
        "[Emily frowns a little, then walks toward the house.]",
        "LORELAI'S HOUSE - INSIDE",
        "[Emily knocks on the door. Lorelai answers it.]",
        "LORELAI: Mom, great. Come on in. Okay, so, is that the dress?",
        "EMILY: Yes, yes -",
        "LORELAI: Okay, well, let me take a look here.",
        "RORY: Hi, Grandma. Big day tomorrow, huh?",
        "EMILY: That wasn't your dinner, was it?",
        "RORY: No, that was just the appetizer.",
        "EMILY: Oh, well that's a relief.",
        "LORELAI: Mom, I don't see anything wrong.",
        "EMILY: Lorelai, are you blind? Look!",
        "LORELAI: Where?",
        "EMILY: Right there. [She points.] That bead and that bead and that bead, all loose.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, I see it now. I don't know how I missed it. Well, this is going to take me no time at all, five minutes tops.",
        "EMILY: Well, don't rush it.",
        "LORELAI: No, no, no rush. It's an easy job. Three and a half minutes and you're on you're way. You don't even need to sit down, because by the time you do, this'll be done. In fact you should have just left the car running 'cause that's how quick this is going to be. [She bolts up the stairs.]",
        "RORY: So how you holding up, Grandma?",
        "EMILY: I'm a wreck, actually.",
        "RORY: Why?",
        "EMILY: Well -",
        "LORELAI [From upstairs]: Two minutes and we're done!",
        "EMILY: I still can't decide exactly what to do with my hair, and I have absolutely zero faith that my wedding planner is going to be able to pull this off -",
        "LORELAI [returning with her sewing things]: Thirty seconds - someone clock me. [To Emily, who is taking off her coat.] What are you doing?",
        "EMILY: Do you have anything to drink?",
        "LORELAI: No, no, Mom, why are you taking off your coat?",
        "EMILY: Some wine, or some chilled vodka, perhaps?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, but you might want to hold off on having a drink, Mom, 'cause you're going to be driving in two shakes of a lamb's tail.",
        "EMILY: Well, I could use a little something. Calm my nerves about this wedding planner I hired.",
        "LORELAI: I'm sure everything's going to be fine.",
        "EMILY: I don't see how it can be, everything is so last minute, and I didn't even get a decent rehearsal!",
        "LORELAI: Mom, I promise you, I have successfully walked in a straight line at least once before. I can get you the cop's name if you want to talk to him.",
        "EMILY: Oh, well, it's too late to do anything about it now. [She gets up to go into the kitchen.]",
        "LORELAI: No, no, Mom. Wait, I'm almost there, I'm almost there! I'm done, I'm done, I'm done!",
        "[The phone rings.]",
        "LORELAI: Stop her from getting a drink.",
        "RORY: How?",
        "LORELAI: Show her Nick Nolte's mug shot. [Answering the phone.] Hello?",
        "[Scene cuts between Lorelai's living room and Richard's study, where there is a group of men smoking cigars and playing cards in the background.]",
        "RICHARD: Lorelai! How are you?",
        "LORELAI: I'm fine, Dad, how are you?",
        "RICHARD: Oh, don't you worry about me. I am in good hands. Isn't that right, boys?",
        "MAN: Right!",
        "LORELAI: Geez, Dad, hanging out at the bath house again?",
        "RICHARD: I am at my bachelor party, Lorelai, and I just thought I'd call and see how your little gathering was going.",
        "LORELAI: My -",
        "RICHARD: Now, I want you to have a wonderful time, and go as crazy as you think is necessary. But make sure your mother doesn't mix her alcohol. Sometimes when she has a little bit too much vodka, she forgets and she goes on to gin. I need her sober and looking beautiful for tomorrow.",
        "MAN: Otherwise you don't have to go through with it. [They laugh.]",
        "LORELAI: So, Dad, Mom told you we were having a party?",
        "RICHARD: Well, she told me she was heading over to your house this evening to spend a little time with \"the girls\", so I put it all together. I'm a very brilliant man, Lorelai. Anyhow, I won't keep you any longer. Just return your mother in one piece, sans tattoos, please.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. Will do.",
        "RICHARD: Have a scandalous time. I'll see you girls tomorrow.",
        "[They hang up.]",
        "LORELAI: Okay, so here's a fun twist for your viewing pleasure. My father thinks my mother is here for her bachelorette party.",
        "RORY: What? Why does he think that?",
        "LORELAI: I think she told him that.",
        "RORY: Oops.",
        "LORELAI: Ah, were we supposed to throw her a bachelorette party?",
        "RORY: I don't know. You're the maid of honor. Aren't you supposed to plan these things?",
        "LORELAI: I didn't think you had a bachelorette party when you hadn't been a bachelorette for forty years. Oh my God, she is going to hold this against me for the rest of my life.",
        "RORY: So what do we do?",
        "[Lorelai sighs and looks in the direction of the kitchen.]",
        "LATER - INSIDE LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "[The doorbell rings. Lorelai answers it. Sookie is standing outside, holding a dish and leaning her head against the doorframe.]",
        "SOOKIE: Davey had just fallen asleep.",
        "LORELAI: I know, I'm sorry. Thank you for coming over at the last minute. Is that -",
        "SOOKIE: Potstickers.",
        "LORELAI: Ah, I love you.",
        "RORY [Walking by, in the hall]: Hi, Sookie!",
        "SOOKIE: Mmhmm.",
        "LORELAI: Go on in the living room.",
        "SOOKIE: Okay. [She starts walking out the door.]",
        "LORELAI [Turning her around]: The other living room.",
        "SOOKIE: Okay.",
        "LORELAI: You're going to have to open your eyes now.",
        "SOOKIE [entering the living room]: Okay.",
        "[Gypsy arrives at the front door.]",
        "GYPSY: Hey, Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, Gypsy. Thanks for coming on such short notice.",
        "GYPSY: I'm always up for a good party.",
        "LORELAI: Emily is in the living room with the others.",
        "GYPSY: Great. Who's Emily?",
        "LORELAI: Follow me, I'll point her out.",
        "GYPSY: Okie dokie.",
        "[They enter the living room. Emily is laughing on the couch with Patty and Babette, drinking from plastic cups.]",
        "LORELAI: Look, everyone, it's Gypsy!",
        "EMILY [drunk]: Gypsy! Gypsy's here! Everyone, Gypsy's here!",
        "LORELAI: Gypsy, that's Emily.",
        "EMILY: Come on, Gypsy, come over here and sit by me.",
        "GYPSY: Okay.",
        "[Babette moves. Gypsy sits next to Emily.]",
        "EMILY: I have to say, Lorelai, I am loving this drink. Have you ever had one of these, Gypsy?",
        "GYPSY: I don't know.",
        "EMILY: It's called a rum and coke.",
        "BABETTE: You know, you may look high-brow, Emily, but underneath, you're just a broad.",
        "[Rory walks in with a plate of tater tots.]",
        "EMILY: Did you hear that, Gypsy, I'm a broad.",
        "GYPSY: Yeah, I always suspected.",
        "RORY [To Lane and Kyon, sitting quietly]: How's it going?",
        "LANE: Great.",
        "KYON: What are we doing here?",
        "LANE: I tried to explain it to her, but it's not working.",
        "RORY: We are throwing my grandmother a bachelorette party.",
        "KYON: But she is married.",
        "RORY: Yeah, but they're doing it again.",
        "KYON: But why?",
        "RORY: Because they want to tell each other that they love each other all over again.",
        "KYON: But why?",
        "RORY: Because they do.",
        "KYON: But why?",
        "RORY: Because it's fun.",
        "KYON: But why?",
        "RORY: Because - [She looks at Lane.]",
        "LANE: Hey, you lasted one more 'But why' than I did.",
        "PATTY: So, Emily, tell us about this party of yours tomorrow.",
        "EMILY: It's going to be fabulous. Isn't it, Lorelai?",
        "LORELAI: Ab fab, sweetie darling.",
        "EMILY: Isn't she hilarious? I never have any idea what she's talking about, but she's so entertaining! Like a chimp. Isn't she like a chimp, Gypsy?",
        "GYPSY: Please make your mother stop talking to me.",
        "LORELAI: If only I had that power.",
        "EMILY: The party is going to be very, very big. Flowers everywhere, and my dress is incredible. The woman who made it is a genius.",
        "[Lorelai and Rory exchange a look.]",
        "BABETTE: So where's it going to be?",
        "EMILY: The Windsor Club.",
        "SOOKIE: Ooh, fancy.",
        "BABETTE: Well, that ain't no toilet bowl.",
        "EMILY: No, it certainly is not. It is the perfect place to have my perfect wedding. And what I had to go through to get it, let me tell you. [She goes to take a sip of her drink.] Lorelai, the cup's empty!",
        "[Lorelai gets up immediately to refill her drink.]",
        "EMILY: It was booked up two years in advance, and the Sheldrakes had the Rose Room. They were having a retirement party or something like that, [Lorelai pours extra rum in Emily's cup] and they simply refused to let us have the room. They were stubborn, and selfish, and now, after all the strings I pulled, they are across town at the Bluestone Club, with their piped-in music and their pornographic fountains.",
        "[Emily and Patty laugh.]",
        "PATTY:",
        "EMILY: I must say this is the best bachelorette party I ever had.",
        "SOOKIE: I really feel like we should play games or something, or have naughty gifts like edible underwear or dirty-shaped pasta.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, too bad - oh, oh! [She gets up.] Just a sec.",
        "EMILY: Where is she going? Gypsy, where is she going?",
        "[Gypsy looks uncomfortable.]",
        "LORELAI: Aha!",
        "SOOKIE: What are you doing?",
        "RORY: No way!",
        "SOOKIE: Where did you get that?",
        "LORELAI: You gave it to me.",
        "SOOKIE: Oh, yeah. [She giggles.]",
        "LORELAI [handing Emily the box of pasta]: Mom, for you on your special night.",
        "EMILY [taking it]: What's this? Oh my God! Oh my God!",
        "[She laughs, along with Patty and Gypsy.]",
        "KYON: What are they laughing at?",
        "LANE [picks up a plate]: Have a tater tot, Kyon.",
        "LORELAI'S HOUSE - MUCH, MUCH LATER",
        "[Rory is cleaning up dishes in the living room. Babette is passed out on the chair. Lorelai tiptoes down the stairs.]",
        "LORELAI: My mother is fast asleep in my bed, clutching my Hello Kitty pillow, and yes, I have pictures!",
        "RORY: I cannot believe how much rum Grandma drank tonight.",
        "LORELAI: How much rum she drank? [She opens up a purse.]",
        "RORY: Hey, that's Grandma's bag. [Lorelai pulls out a book.] What are you doing?",
        "LORELAI: I have no idea, I am drunk. [She skips into the kitchen.]",

For example, you're Trip's second cousin, but Trip's daughter is your second cousin, once removed.

You are good friends, and we are very, very lucky. Now, in planning our traditional first dance, I gave a lot of thought to the song that would represent the next phase in our marriage. The best phase in our marriage, I believe. [Emily blows him a kiss.] I went over all the greats \u00af Bennett, Sinatra, Chuck Berry \u00af and a story popped into my head.

It was a popular song on the radio and it soon became Emily's favorite. Of course, it drove me crazy \u00af some woman complaining about how she wanted to marry a man named Bill. Not exactly Cole Porter. Emily would tease me, saying, 'If only your name was Bill, then this could be our song.' Well, Emily, for tonight, and tonight only, my name is Bill, and this is our song.
