        "[Lorelai, Rory, and Lane are walking through the center of town]",
        "LANE: Are you serious?",
        "LORELAI: I am serious.",
        "LANE: We can really rehearse in your garage?",
        "LORELAI: In exchange for the promise that you never pose naked on the cover of Rolling Stone no matter how much trouble your career is in.",
        "LANE: I promise. I love you. Do you know how amazing your mother is?",
        "LORELAI: No. Tell her, would ya? She forgot this morning.",
        "RORY: Because hot water is enjoyed by all, not just by you.",
        "LORELAI: I wasn't in the shower that long.",
        "RORY: Man, it's winter carnival time again already.",
        "LANE: Yup.",
        "RORY: Are you going?",
        "LANE: I have to. We are raising money for the marching band this year, mandatory booth manning is involved.",
        "LORELAI: Man, Lane \u0096 marching band, rock band.",
        "LANE: Music is my life.",
        "LORELAI: Hi Mrs. Kim!",
        "LANE: So not funny.",
        "RORY: Raising money for the marching band to do what?",
        "LORELAI: Please let it be new uniforms.",
        "LANE: It's for letters so we can finally have letter carriers. For some reason, the powers that be think that the reason we never win at competitions is because no one knows who we are. The fact that we suck has never occurred to them. What's wrong with our uniforms?",
        "LORELAI: Nothing.",
        "LANE: We look stupid, right?",
        "LORELAI: No.",
        "LANE: The plumes are too big, and it looks like big red fountains of blood spurting out of our heads.",
        "LORELAI: I love the uniforms.",
        "LANE: It's bad enough I have to be in marching band at all without being mocked for what is mandatory for us to wear.",
        "LORELAI: No, no, no, I didn't mean, I. . .remind her that she gets to rehearse in our garage \u0091cause I think I'm losing points here.",
        "RORY: Your uniforms are great, and people knowing who you are can only help. Now let's just enjoy the snow, okay?",
        "LANE: Okay.",
        "LORELAI: Okay.",
        "RORY: Especially since some of us have been freezing since our showers this morning.",
        "LORELAI: I wasn't in there that long.",
        "LANE: I'm sorry, can we get back to the band uniforms, \u0091cause on a scale of one to ten, how much do I not wanna let Dave see me like that?",
        "LORELAI/RORY: Ten.",
        "LANE: Okay, thanks.",

        "CUT TO CHILTON CLASSROOM",
        "TEACHER: To evaluate the value of a function of X when X equals pi. You want to start by splitting the intregal into two separate intregals. Now, since the left intregal is a variable of a constant exponent, remember C is a constant, add one and divide by the new power.",
        "MADELINE: Paris, what did he say?",
        "PARIS: Hm?",
        "MADELINE: He's talking too fast, I missed it.",
        "PARIS: Ask Louise.",
        "MADELINE: Louise, what did he say?",
        "LOUISE: I don't know, ask Paris.",
        "MADELINE: She told me to ask you.",
        "LOUISE: Why would she do that?",
        "MADELINE: I don't know.",
        "LOUISE: Did you guys have a fight?",
        "MADELINE: Not that I know of.",
        "TEACHER: . . . The right intregal, however, is more complex. You have to use U substitution with U equals 3 feet. [bell rings] We'll pick up at the same place tomorrow.",
        "RORY: The bell rang.",
        "PARIS: What?",
        "RORY: The bell? That loud metal musical contraption that when hit loudly by a vibrating mallet signals the end of this particular educational experience.",
        "PARIS: Class is over?",
        "RORY: Yup.",
        "PARIS: What did he talk about?",
        "MADELINE: Ask Louise.",
        "PARIS: I didn't take notes. I didn't pay attention. I'm going to. . .",
        "RORY: Borrow my notes and be just fine.",
        "PARIS: Thank you.",
        "MADELINE: Madeline want notes, too, please.",
        "LOUISE: Add one and divide by the new power? Oh, I thought it said add one and divide by the Jew power. It makes much more sense this way.",
        "PARIS: I can't believe I zoned out for the entire class.",
        "RORY: You must have a lot on your mind.",
        "PARIS: I do.",
        "RORY: I'm sure. Okay, so, onto the next thing. I don't think I'll have the prom bids ready for the supplemental student council meeting this week.",
        "PARIS: Oh.",
        "RORY: They need a little more time to get the details together, so that leaves a little hole in our agenda. Any thoughts?",
        "PARIS: Well, we can just cancel the supplementary meeting this week.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "PARIS: Well, if there's nothing really to talk about, what's the point, right?",
        "LOUISE: You said that one student council meeting a week was not enough.",
        "MADELINE: Yeah, you said that was no way to govern, that meeting once a week was lazy, ineffectual, and if we were going to do it like that, we might as well just buy ourselves a ranch in Texas.",
        "PARIS: Fine, if you guys wanna sit around for an hour after school swapping makeover horror stories, then count me in. Hey, did I ever tell you about the time I plucked outside of my designated brow line? Man, was my face red.",
        "MADELINE: I've done that, too. Ooh, it's bad.",
        "LOUISE: She was being sarcastic.",
        "MADELINE: Well, I wasn't. I looked surprised for a month.",
        "PARIS: We'll just take this week off, and next week we'll go back to twice a week, okay?",
        "RORY: Sounds fair.",
        "LOUISE: Sounds fab.",
        "FRANCIE: I heard something about the supplemental student council meeting \u0096 anything I need to know about, a new chart to be made, perhaps?",
        "PARIS: No. We were just saying that the agenda seems light this week, so I've decided to cancel it, and we can just gather at the regular meeting on Friday.",
        "FRANCIE: Wow, this is quite a change in plans.",
        "PARIS: You have a problem with it?",
        "FRANCIE: No, I'm just surprised. You seem so attached to those meetings.",
        "PARIS: Well, I finally got a blankie. It's much better.",
        "FRANCIE: Okay, no extra meeting this week. What will I do with all that extra time? Well, I guess I'll think of something.",
        "PARIS: Take a picture of which outfit wins, will ya?",
        "RORY: Bye Francie.",
        "FRANCIE: Bye.",
        "[Rory and Paris walk into the hallway]",
        "PARIS: I met his parents.",
        "RORY: You did?",
        "PARIS: He bought me a ticket, and I took the train to Philadelphia, and he met me at the station, and I spent Christmas with him and his family.",
        "RORY: Sounds nice.",
        "PARIS: No, not nice. It was perfect. They had a Christmas tree twelve feet tall. Everything was red and silver and there was eggnog. Have you ever had eggnog?",
        "RORY: Yes, I have.",
        "PARIS: It's disgusting.",
        "RORY: Yes, it is.",
        "PARIS: But disgusting in a really great way. And they had tiny wreaths hanging from every doorknob, and mistletoe and candles everywhere. I couldn't believe it. I mean, I've never had a Christmas before. One year, I asked my mother if we could get a Chanukah bush. She made me watch Shoah the rest of the week.",
        "RORY: Wow.",
        "PARIS: The place smelled like cinnamon all the time, and there was a fire in the fireplace, and a ton of presents. I mean, hundreds of presents. I'm looking at this mound of gifts, and I'm thinking, \u0091Eight days of Chanukah. . . who was the skinflint who thought up that deal?'",
        "RORY: Don't the eight days symbolize something?",
        "PARIS: Yes, they symbolize eight days of ripping off the little kids who can't have a Chanukah bush.",
        "RORY: You're making me sad.",
        "PARIS: His mother bought me a present.",
        "RORY: Well, that says something.",
        "PARIS: What does it say?",
        "RORY: It says that Jamie likes you enough that she felt compelled to buy you a present.",
        "PARIS: I had the most amazing time. Sitting around the tree opening presents, and they played Christmas music and we drank apple cider. . .it was so nice. And then his grandfather and I wound up in a theological discussion. Jesus \u0096 Messiah or nice Jewish kid with a hammer? It got pretty heated.",
        "RORY: Okay, skip to the end, I can't take it. How did it turn out?",
        "PARIS: He told me he loved me.",
        "RORY: Aw, Paris!",
        "PARIS: I never thought I'd hear a boy tell me he loved me.",
        "RORY: That's great.",
        "PARIS: He invited me back up for Easter break.",
        "RORY: You're going, I assume?",
        "PARIS: Are you kidding? And miss a chance to debate Christ rising from the dead? I'm so there.",
        "RORY: Jamie's a lucky man.",

        "[Lorelai walks through the dining room as Michel speaks Hungarian to a group of guests. The guests get angry, and Michel runs out of the room]",
        "MICHEL: Move, please.",
        "LORELAI: Whoa, what's going on?",
        "MICHEL: I cannot talk now, please.",
        "LORELAI: Michel, they sound really angry.",
        "MICHEL: They do, don't they?",
        "LORELAI: What did you say?",
        "MICHEL: I don't know.",
        "LORELAI: What do you mean you don't know? All you had to say was \u0091Welcome to Stars Hollow,' that's it.",
        "MICHEL: I know, I thought I did, and then they got angry and threw breadsticks and butter pats.",
        "LORELAI: Michel.",
        "MICHEL: I'm looking. [flips through a dictionary]",
        "LORELAI: You only had to say one word in Hungarian \u0096 welcome, that's it. How bad could it be?",
        "MICHEL: Very bad.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, Michel.",
        "MICHEL: Very, very bad.",
        "LORELAI: Be careful.",
        "[Michel walks back to the guests as the phone rings. Lorelai answers]",
        "LORELAI: Independence Inn, Lorelai speaking.",
        "EMILY: Well, your father's sixtieth birthday dinner is back on.",
        "LORELAI: What sixtieth birthday dinner?",
        "EMILY: The one that I had planned for Wednesday night.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, were we coming?",
        "EMILY: Of course you were coming. You think you wouldn't be invited?",
        "LORELAI: Well, apparently, we weren't invited.",
        "EMILY: I had just started planning the whole thing when he came home in a mood and declared that parties were for children and it was canceled.",
        "LORELAI: Were we disappointed?",
        "EMILY: However, today he came in and changed his mind, so I expect the two of you at eight. And bring a gift, but don't get him a cigar humidor.",
        "LORELAI: Okay.",
        "EMILY: I bought him a cigar humidor.",
        "LORELAI: I assumed.",
        "EMILY: It's gorgeous. It belonged to a lieutenant in the army in World War I. Apparently, he kept it in his field office in France. There are carvings in the bottom that the dealer said could possibly be coded messages.",
        "LORELAI: Cool.",
        "EMILY: I think so, too. All right, eight o'clock, do not be late.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, we will not be late. Bye. [hangs up the phone as Michel walks back to the desk] Well?",
        "MICHEL: It's fine. All we have to do is pay the ransom and they will give us the busboy back.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, whoa, uh. . .",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "[Lorelai walks into the kitchen and starts screaming. She traps a spider under a cup on the floor. There's a knock at the back door.]",

        "DEAN: Hi. Uh, I hope I'm not disturbing anything.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, no, absolutely not.",
        "DEAN: Good. Um, I just wanted to. . .",
        "LORELAI: Ah, ah!",
        "DEAN: What?",
        "LORELAI: Don't kick the cup.",
        "DEAN: The what?",
        "LORELAI: I have a spider whose previous credits include the bathtub scene from Annie Hall trapped under that cup.",
        "DEAN: The size of a Buick?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah.",
        "DEAN: I see. And what are you planning to do now that you've got him trapped?",
        "LORELAI: Well, I was thinking of just giving him the kitchen.",
        "DEAN: Okay.",
        "LORELAI: \u0091Cause, you know, we don't use it very much anyhow, so, uh. . .",
        "DEAN: I could get rid of it if you want.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, that'd be great. Just, careful . . . He heard me talking, so don't let him get away. He knows I'm behind this, he'll come after me. Ugh, ugh, ugh. I guess you can see why camping's completely out of the question for me.",
        "DEAN: Got it.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, great. Could ya. . .uh. . .[gestures to the back door]",
        "DEAN: Oh, yeah, yeah, no problem.",
        "LORELAI: Don't let his family see you. Spiders are vindictive.",
        "[Dean takes the spider out the back door]",
        "RORY: [calls from front hall] Mom?",
        "LORELAI: Uh, Rory.",
        "[Rory walks into the kitchen]",
        "RORY: Can we do pizza tonight? I've got a ton of studying to do.",
        "LORELAI: Sure, pizza sounds great.",
        "RORY: Good. Why's the door open?",
        "LORELAI: The door is open because. . .Dean's here.",
        "[Dean walks in]",
        "RORY: Hi.",
        "DEAN: Hi.",
        "LORELAI: Um, Dean threw out a spider for me.",
        "DEAN: I just came by to drop off some of your stuff.",
        "RORY: Oh.",
        "DEAN: Just some books you loaned me, a couple of CD's.",

        "LORELAI: Thanks Dean.",
        "[Dean leaves]",
        "LORELAI: It was a really big spider. I think it had a gun. What are you feeling right now?",
        "RORY: Nothing.",
        "LORELAI: Not weirded out, even a little?",
        "RORY: Why would I be weirded out?",
        "LORELAI: Well, Dean coming over, bringing your stuff back.",
        "RORY: No, I'm fine.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. Although, you know, if you were weirded out a little, it would be okay. It wouldn't mean that you don't like Jess, or that you made a mistake. It would just mean the guy who was in your life for two years isn't there anymore.",
        "RORY: I was just surprised, that's all.",
        "LORELAI: If you say so.",
        "RORY: I do.",
        "LORELAI: Okay.",
        "RORY: I'm gonna go start studying.",

        "[Rory and Jess are walking through the town square]",
        "RORY: You know what just occurred to me? That we are very fortunate to have good teeth.",
        "JESS: Yes, very fortunate.",
        "RORY: Can you imagine if braces were involved in this interaction?",
        "JESS: It'd be a bloodbath.",
        "RORY: I can't catch my breath.",
        "JESS: You're not supposed to.",
        "RORY: Hey, listen, Thursday night is the Stars Hollow High Winter Carnival.",
        "JESS: Oh yeah?",
        "RORY: Yeah, I thought we could go, meet Lane there.",
        "JESS: Nope.",
        "RORY: But it'd be really fun. They'll have really bad games and really bad food and the marching band will play and \u0096",
        "JESS: Rory, I'm doing some of my best work here and you're just talking right through it.",
        "RORY: Come on, let's go to the carnival.",
        "JESS: I don't go to these stupid town things.",
        "RORY: You went to the Bid-A-Basket festival. You went to the dance marathon.",
        "JESS: That was when I was trying to get you. I now have you. That means I don't have to go anymore.",
        "RORY: You're serious?",
        "JESS: As a heart attack.",
        "RORY: But it'll be fun.",
        "JESS: We can have our own fun.",
        "RORY: I can't miss the winter carnival.",
        "JESS: Rory, come on.",
        "RORY: Well, I never have. I can't. Just go with me, please.",
        "JESS: Look, how \u0091bout you go to the festival, meet Lane, and then I'll hook up with you afterwards.",
        "RORY: Jess.",
        "JESS: That's my final offer, man.",
        "RORY: Fine.",
        "JESS: Fine.",

        "JESS: Come upstairs and I'll show you.",
        "RORY: Upstairs?",
        "JESS: Yeah.",

        "JESS: See ya. [goes upstairs]",
        "LORELAI: Were you guys gonna go upstairs and kiss?",
        "RORY: Wow, look at all the bags.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, I went shopping for my father's birthday present today, which was great for about fifteen minutes, until it all came back to me.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: The fact that I totally suck at buying my father presents.",
        "RORY: He'll like whatever you get him.",
        "LORELAI: If I slip him a quaalude, he'll like whatever I get him.",
        "RORY: They are not that bad.",
        "LORELAI: My intentions are always good, and I never put a price limit on it. I even went so far as to follow older men around the store who kind of looked like my dad to see what they were buying, which didn't help me with ideas, but I did get asked to the antique car show.",
        "RORY: Just show me what you got.",
        "LORELAI: Fine. Option number one \u0096 a state of the art, high tech, titanium bathroom scale.",
        "RORY: Huh.",
        "LORELAI: What? He has weight.",
        "RORY: Yes, but I'm not sure that his birthday is the time to remind him of it.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, option number two \u0096 a fabulous mechanical coin sorter. You put the coins in, it sorts them. What?",
        "RORY: Well, it's a little generic.",
        "LORELAI: Generic in a good way, or. . .",
        "RORY: What's the third option?",
        "LORELAI: See, I should have pulled the coin sorter out last, \u0091cause. . .",
        "RORY: Mom.",
        "LORELAI: Okay.",
        "RORY: A tie.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, it's silk.",
        "RORY: It's nice.",
        "LORELAI: It is?",
        "LUKE: What's that?",
        "LORELAI: It's a tie for my father's birthday.",
        "LUKE: What, no Aramis this year?",
        "LORELAI: No, he likes ties.",
        "LUKE: You know, if you get the big bottle, it usually comes with a tote bag and a soap on a rope.",
        "LORELAI: Go away. My gifts suck.",
        "RORY: It's the thought that counts.",
        "LORELAI: What'd you get him?",
        "RORY: Nothing big.",
        "LORELAI: Well, what?",
        "RORY: Just a thing.",
        "LORELAI: What kind of thing?",
        "RORY: Chuck Berry Live at the Fillmore on vinyl.",
        "LORELAI: Oh my God, that's perfect. He loves Chuck Berry. How did you come up with that?",
        "RORY: I called him and asked him what he wanted.",
        "LORELAI: That's cheating.",
        "RORY: Tough.",
        "LORELAI: Well, now what am I gonna do? I can't give him a tie when you give him the world's most perfect present we already know he likes.",
        "RORY: You want me to go find something for you?",
        "LORELAI: You would do that?",
        "RORY: He gave me a couple other suggestions. I can go see if I can find one of them.",
        "LORELAI: Ugh, my God, I love you. You are my angel.",
        "RORY: Hey, you had one more that you didn't show me.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, yeah \u0096 it lights up and sings.",
