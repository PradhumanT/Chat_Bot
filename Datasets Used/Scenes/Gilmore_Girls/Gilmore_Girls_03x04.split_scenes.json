        "Lorelai's stint in the Stars Hollow High School local business success speakers forum gets derailed by some controversial personal questions, much to the delight of Luke and the consternation of some PTA mothers; Luke and Jess argue about the women in and out of their lives (and their closets); Lane alleviates her frustration about the strictures of her household and the future of her band through a colorful, if temporary, display of independence; Rory runs into Shane one too many times and succumbs to a severe bout of snarkiness."

        "OPEN IN LUKE'S DINER",
        "[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at a table]",
        "LORELAI: So, I think I'm in touch with the other side.",
        "RORY: The other side of. . .",
        "LORELAI: The other side.",
        "RORY: With republicans?",
        "LORELAI: No. Lately I've been having these dark premonitions.",
        "RORY: Oh, about what?",
        "[Luke brings their plates]",
        "LUKE: Dead cow, dead cow. [walks away]",
        "LORELAI: That's weird.",
        "RORY: He's always weird.",
        "LORELAI: No, I mean, my premonitions have been about death, about my death.",
        "RORY: I don't wanna hear this.",
        "LORELAI: And the thing is, they're all silly.",
        "RORY: What do you mean, silly?",
        "LORELAI: In one, I slip on a banana peel and fall into a giant vat of whipped cream.",
        "RORY: Silly and fattening.",
        "LORELAI: In another, a turtle eats me.",
        "RORY: A turtle, how?",
        "LORELAI: Very slowly. There's lots of chewing.",
        "RORY: And in your premonition, you didn't run away from what is perhaps the slowest land animal on the earth?",
        "LORELAI: His first bite injects me with immobilizing poison.",
        "RORY: Well, you left that part out.",
        "LORELAI: Now, this last one's a little more gory. I'm out hunting \u0096",
        "RORY: A favorite Lorelai Gilmore pastime.",
        "LORELAI: And my shotgun backfires and my whole face spins around a bunch of times and winds up in the back of my head like Daffy Duck.",
        "RORY: That's the silliest one yet.",
        "LORELAI: Now, if that's how I go, you gotta promise to move my face back to the front of my head like Daffy did with his beak.",
        "RORY: I should be writing this down.",
        "LORELAI: You can remember to move my face to the front of my head.",
        "RORY: It depends on what I have going on that week.",
        "[Lane walks into the diner]",
        "LANE: Hello Stars Hollow, are you ready to rock?",
        "LORELAI: Let me guess, band practice tonight?",
        "LANE: Yes, we're going to learn our fourth song. That's practically a set.",
        "[Lane sits down with them and takes a bite of Rory's burger]",
        "LORELAI: Hm, I'm impressed.",
        "LANE: And then once we have a set, we'll get a gig, and then once we get a gig, we'll get a record deal.",
        "LORELAI: Swallow.",
        "LANE: And then after we get a record deal, we'll get really famous and then we'll have to give all of these interviews about how horrible it is to be really famous and how we never wanted this in the first place, all we care about is the music, and fame is gonna tear us apart. It's gonna be great!",
        "LORELAI: And rehearsing in the music shop's been working out?",
        "LANE: Perfectly \u0096 it's totally time efficient, being a thirty-second commute from my house. We practice for two hours, I'm home in time to watch reruns of Johnny Yune's talk show on Korean television with my mom, who thinks I hooked up with you guys \u0096 which I did, so I'm not even lying.",
        "LORELAI: Well, you're kinda lying.",
        "LANE: I'm fibbing, but a fib is not a lie.",
        "LORELAI: Hm, I'd say it's a fib-slash-lie.",
        "LANE: No, no, it's not a lie, and I can always tell \u0091cause of the few times that I've out and out lied to my mother, I'd get this feeling in my gut like a wild animal was burrowing into it, and I'm not getting that.",
        "LORELAI: Wild animals burrowing into my stomach \u0096 another one of my premonitions.",
        "RORY: Pretty spooky.",
        "LANE: I've gotta go. I'm single-handedly improving the reputation of drummers everywhere by being on time for every rehearsal. [takes Rory's burger] Thanks for the food. [leaves]",
        "[Rory takes Lorelai's burger]",
        "LORELAI: Uh, excuse me.",
        "RORY: Lane took mine.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, this band thing is really not working out for me. Let's go. See ya, Luke.",
        "LUKE: See ya.",
        "[Lorelai and Rory walk to the door as Shane walks in]",
        "LORELAI: Turn sideways!",
        "[Shane rushes past them over to Jess at the counter]",
        "LORELAI: That girl's a freak.",
        "[Jess and Shane start kissing]",
        "LUKE: Make a hole.",
        "[Jess and Shane stop kissing long enough for Luke to walk past them]",
        "[opening credits]",
        "CUT TO THE MUSIC SHOP",
        "[Lane and her band are practicing]",
        "ZACH: [sings] London calling to the faraway towns, now that the war's declared and battle come down. London calling to the underworld, come out of the cupboard, you boys and girls. . .",
        "DAVE: Whoa whoa whoa, can you guys hold it? It doesn't sound right.",
        "LANE: It sounded good to me.",
        "DAVE: No, it's wrong. Something's missing.",
        "ZACH: Yeah, volume.",
        "LANE: We can't play any louder, guys.",
        "ZACH: We've got to.",
        "LANE: But that's the agreement \u0096 free practice space, but we have to play quietly.",
        "DAVE: Just try and live with it, Zach.",
        "ZACH: Dude, Brian's breathing is louder than the song.",
        "BRIAN: I've got a deviated septum. All the women in my family and me have it.",
        "ZACH: Well, it's throwing me off.",
        "LANE: Hold your breath when we're playing, Brian. There, problem solved. Okay, come on, now, let's rock. One, two, three \u0096",
        "ZACH: Wait. The bottom line here is that breathing should not be louder than a rock band. Am I right or am I right?",
        "BRIAN: You're right.",
        "ZACH: Rygalski?",
        "DAVE: Well, it \u0096",
        "ZACH: We need to crank it up.",
        "LANE: Just listen harder, that'll make it sound louder.",
        "DAVE: Can't we turn it up at all?",
        "LANE: Well, maybe we could possibly turn the amps up from three to, say, three and a half, but that's it.",
        "ZACH: Forget it.",
        "DAVE: Zach, come on, we just got started.",
        "ZACH: Dude, Lawrence Welk cranked louder than this. It's a waste of time.",
        "LANE: Wait, Zach, no, you don't understand. We can't play louder. See, my mom has this special antenna that can pick up non-Christian music being played within a football field's distance of our house, and she'd immediately come looking for me in order to shield me from the perversion.",
        "BRIAN: If Zach's going, I'm going.",
        "LANE: Wait, no, Brian, I'm not exaggerating. Once, a guy in our town named Kirk was practicing Bohemian Rhapsody with his band, the Kirk Gleason Five, and my mom shut them down so fast that the band fled without their instruments and never came back for them. To this day, Kirk can't listen to Queen without tearing up.",
        "BRIAN: Sorry.",
        "ZACH: Having a free practice space was cool and all, but not like this.",
        "BRIAN: We should just rent a space in Hartford.",
        "LANE: Hartford, Connecticut?",
        "ZACH: It's not that far.",
        "LANE: Yeah, or maybe, how \u0091bout France? We could practice in France, too, or Iceland!",
        "DAVE: Lane.",
        "LANE: The moon's probably available, we could crank it way up on the moon!",
        "DAVE: A word, please.",
        "[Dave leads Lane outside onto the sidewalk]",
        "LANE: Dave, talk to them. You're the leader, that's flat out insubordination going on in there! They show be flogged, heel-hogged, strung up from the highest yardarm!",
        "DAVE: No, I can't.",
        "LANE: Why?",
        "DAVE: Because we're supposed to be a one-for-all band like the Clash or U2 \u0096 it's a democracy.",
        "LANE: Democracies are overrated. Now get in there and kick some butt.",
        "DAVE: It's not how it works.",
        "LANE: I'll fix Brian's deviated septum \u0096 I'll ram one of my sticks up his nose!",
        "DAVE: Lane, think about this, do you really believe this is working?",
        "LANE: No, it's not working. We sound like a bunch of w*nk*rs.",
        "DAVE: We need a real practice space. We need to be able to really play. Wouldn't you like to actually be able to hit both the cymbals?",
        "LANE: Yeah.",
        "DAVE: Okay, then, we need to do this.",
        "LANE: I know, I just don't wanna leave the band.",
        "DAVE: What? You can't leave the band. That's not what anybody wants, especially me. Lane, listen to me, okay \u0096 you're perfect for us, it's working.",
        "LANE: So I have to figure out a way to rehearse in Hartford two or three nights a week.",
        "DAVE: Yeah, that's not so tough.",
        "LANE: No, it's not so tough. And maybe at the same time I'll attempt to master quantum physics, and throw Sanskrit in there, too.",
        "DAVE: Do your best. Not with the Sanskrit thing, that's pretty worthless \u0096 but with the band.",
        "LANE: I'll try.",
        "DAVE: There's no way you're gonna become our Pete Best. There's no way.",
        "LANE: You're sweet.",
        "DAVE: We should get back in there.",
        "LANE: Okay, um, I'll be in in a minute.",
        "CUT TO LANE'S BEDROOM",
        "[Lane is in her closet talking on the phone]",
        "LANE: Wrack your brain. I mean, we've really gotta think here.",
        "RORY: It's quite a pickle.",
        "LANE: No, Rory, pickles are smaller. This is much bigger than a pickle.",
        "[At Lorelai's house, Rory is in her bedroom on the phone]",
        "RORY: Okay, let's stop saying the word pickle.",
        "LANE: Fine.",
        "RORY: Now, how many nights a week would you have to go to Hartford to practice?",
        "LANE: Two, plus a weekend afternoon.",
        "RORY: Okay, so that's three big blocks of time that you'd have to account for.",
        "LANE: Very big blocks of time.",
        "RORY: Plus, you have no car to transport your drums anywhere as of yet.",
        "LANE: Or a driver's license.",
        "RORY: Or any drums because you're borrowing them from the shop.",
        "LANE: Temporarily until I can buy my own set \u0096 with money that I don't know where I'm gonna get.",
        "RORY: Yup, you're right \u0096 that's more than a pickle.",
        "LANE: You're making light \u0096 now stop and focus. And turn down the Cornershop, it's distracting.",
        "RORY: No, your Coltrane is distracting, turn that down.",
        "LANE: Hey, I'm in angst here and Coltrane speaks to my soul. I can't turn it down.",
        "RORY: Fine, in deference to your soul, I'll turn mine down. Hey, here's a crazy thought. How about you tell your mom the truth and insist that she lets you play with the band and rehearse in Stars Hollow loudly as long as your schoolwork doesn't suffer?",
        "LANE: Oh, I'm sorry, was that a serious suggestion?",
        "RORY: Hey, it's worth a shot.",
        "LANE: No, you're thinking your mom, here, Rory. If I said that to mine, she'd start waving a crucifix at me.",
        "RORY: If she says no, she says no, but right now you're out of options. We have another call, just think about it?",
        "LANE: Okay, I will. And hey, you know I like Cornershop.",
        "RORY: I know. Bye.",
        "LANE: Bye.",
        "[Rory answers the call waiting]",
        "RORY: Hello?",
        "DEBBIE: Hi, Rory?",
        "RORY: Yes.",
        "DEBBIE: This is Debbie Fincher \u0096 Kathy's mom from Stars Hollow High.",
        "RORY: Oh, hi Mrs. Fincher.",
        "DEBBIE: Well, hi right back to you. You know, we miss you since you started that fancy school of yours. Is it fun?",
        "RORY: It's hard but I like it.",
        "DEBBIE: Oh well, super. Uh, listen, is your mom home?",
        "RORY: Oh, sure, just a second. Say hi to Kathy for me.",
        "DEBBIE: I will.",
        "RORY: Hold on.",
        "[Rory walks into the kitchen; Lorelai is sitting at the table]",
        "RORY: Phone. It's Debbie Fincher.",
        "LORELAI: Who?",
        "RORY: From Stars Hollow High. Kathy Fincher's mom.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, I remember Kathy.",
        "RORY: You met Debbie many times, had many conversations with her at bake sales, school plays, the PTA.",
        "LORELAI: Not ringing a bell.",
        "RORY: I used to go swimming at her house all the time. You and Debbie had long chats when you dropped me off.",
        "LORELAI: No. . .no.",
        "RORY: Blonde hair, medium height, drove a Range Rover.",
        "LORELAI: Does she also breathe and have toes?",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: Well, narrow it down to less than eight thousand possibilities.",
        "RORY: I did with the swimming.",
        "LORELAI: I remember the water.",
        "RORY: Come on, blonde hair, medium height.",
        "LORELAI: See, even you can't think of another way to describe her.",
        "RORY: You have no memory of this woman?",
        "LORELAI: All those Stars Hollow moms looked alike, except for Lane's mom and that one mom with the freaky glass eye that never moved.",
        "RORY: Take the phone.",
        "LORELAI: [on phone] Hi Debbie, how are you?",
        "DEBBIE: Great, Lorelai, and yourself?",
        "LORELAI: Just fine, thanks.",
        "DEBBIE: The gang and I have missed you so much at school events. You were always such a kick.",
        "LORELAI: Aw, well, I really miss you and the gang.",
        "DEBBIE: Hey, listen, I have a proposition for you. The PTA likes to ask prominent locals in business if they could talk to the students about how they got to where they are \u0096 you know, all the hard work it takes, success stories, you know. And we thought about you.",
        "LORELAI: To suggest people I know who have success stories, or. . .",
        "DEBBIE: No, silly, we'd like for you to address the class.",
        "LORELAI: Me, really?",
        "DEBBIE: Well, yes. You're a young woman and you run that beautiful inn, it's a huge responsibility, and you do it with such style.",
        "LORELAI: Wow, well, that's really sweet. It's always nice to be well thought of.",
        "Oh, Debbie, before we go any further, I'm dying to know \u0096 how's Kathy? What's she up to?",
        "DEBBIE: She is just terrific. She's applied to a couple schools in California, so she's really excited, although. . .",
        "[Lorelai covers the mouthpiece of the phone and talks to Rory]",
        "LORELAI: So she wants me to speak to some kids about my business success.",
        "RORY: Really?",
        "LORELAI: Yes.",
        "RORY: That's great. What are you doing with the phone?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, she's blabbing about her kid. We probably got another thirty seconds or so.",
        "RORY: You're awful.",
        "LORELAI: No, I'm a kick. Should I do it?",
        "RORY: Yeah, toot your own horn, you little missy.",
        "LORELAI: I'm a success, who'd have thought?",
        "RORY: I suspected you had it in you.",
        "LORELAI: From rags to riches. . .I wonder why Larry King hasn't called.",
        "RORY: Mom, Debbie, please.",
        "[Lorelai brings the phone back up to her ear]",
        "DEBBIE: . . .so the internship will keep her local, which is a nice bonus for Bill and me, you know?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, sure, yeah. Well, be sure to say hi to her and to Bill, and by the way, yes, I'd be happy to talk to the class.",
        "DEBBIE: Terrific! Oh, the gang will be so thrilled. Now, there'll probably be a second speaker with you, do you mind?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, that's fine, who's it gonna be?",
        "DEBBIE: Uh, well, we've had some suggestions, but do you know anyone?",
        "LORELAI: Well, you know, my friend the Sultan of Brunei is so hard to pin down.",
        "DEBBIE: Ha-ha, there's that sense of humor. Well, we were considering Luke Danes, but he usually turns these things down.",
        "LORELAI: I could talk to him if you'd like.",
        "DEBBIE: That would be just terrific. The two of you together would be a kick.",
        "LORELAI: Well, then, I'll just kick him \u0091til he agrees to do it, how does that sound?",
        "DEBBIE: Okay, Thursday at four p.m., is that okay?",
        "LORELAI: I'll be there, Deb.",
        "DEBBIE: Oh, you rat! You rat!",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "DEBBIE: You remembered how much I hate being called Deb.",
        "LORELAI: I'm wicked.",
        "DEBBIE: Well, thank you Lorelai, and I'll talk to you soon.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, bye. [hangs up] Huh. She hates being called Deb.",
        "RORY: I'll make a mental note. [pinches Lorelai's cheeks]",
        "LORELAI: Ow, ow, ow!",
        "RORY: I'm so proud of my little success!",
        "CUT TO KIM'S ANTIQUES",
        "[Lane walks down the steps. She starts to walk toward her mother in the kitchen, then walks back to the steps and starts talking to herself]",
        "LANE: Stop it, don't run, just walk in there and tell her what you want. After all, she's your mother and she wants you to be happy . . .on some level, I think. Maybe not. What are you doing? Do not back off. Just move. Come on, move. Move your foot, move your foot, one foot. Lane, move your foot, right.",
        "[her mother comes up behind her]",
        "MRS. KIM: Lane!",
        "LANE: Yeah?",
        "MRS. KIM: Come with me.",
        "LANE: Okay.",
        "[They walk to the kitchen.]",
        "MRS. KIM: Sit, sit. You want tea?",
        "LANE: Mama, I wanna \u0096",
        "MRS. KIM: Sit.",
        "LANE: Sorry. I wanted to talk to you about something, um, an idea I had. . have, for me to do something that would be very beneficial to me, and you by extension because well, if one person is happy, then the other person is happy, and so I had an idea that, of how I could be and then you could be and then we would be and. . .tea would be good.",
        "MRS. KIM: Here, I want you to fill these out. [hands her a stack of papers]",
        "LANE: What are these?",
        "MRS. KIM: College applications.",
        "LANE: What?",
        "MRS. KIM: Don't worry. Every one in this pile approved by me and Reverend Melmin.",
        "LANE: I haven't heard of one of these schools.",
        "MRS. KIM: They're all good religious programs, and I've already thrown out the ones that let boys and girls sit in the cafeteria together, the party schools.",
        "LANE: Oh, great.",
        "MRS. KIM: I will help you fill them out and we'll mail them on the way to choir practice, okay?",
        "LANE: Yes, Mama.",
        "MRS. KIM: Good. Now, if you meet Jesus walking on the street, what are the three questions you would like to ask? Ah.",
        "CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN",
        "[Lorelai is at the front desk organizing some index cards]",
        "MICHEL: Hm, your speech for that class?",
        "LORELAI: Just some talking points.",
        "MICHEL: And this speech is about your success in business, yes?",
        "LORELAI: Pretty much.",
        "MICHEL: You must be very fortunate to live in this tiny town where people make very little money. It elevates you by comparison.",
        "LORELAI: Mmhmm.",
        "MICHEL: I wonder who their last speaker was -- the fellow in short pants that walks up and down the square with a metal detector?",
        "LORELAI: Hm, I wouldn't know.",
        "MICHEL: And if they find someone who drives a car that is less than eight years old, what will they do \u0096 crown him king of successful people?",
        "LORELAI: Unless it's a woman, and then they'll crown her queen.",
        "MICHEL: Mm, and if they are \u0096",
        "[phone rings]",
        "LORELAI: Go away. [answers phone] Independence Inn, Lorelai speaking.",
        "LUKE: I'm backing out.",
        "LORELAI: Too late, sorry.",
        "LUKE: I'm not speaking to that stupid class.",
        "LORELAI: But you agreed.",
        "LUKE: I'm out, case closed, no debating.",
        "LORELAI: Great, fine, do what you want. I guess I'm just out the thousand-dollar deposit.",
        "LUKE: What deposit?",
        "LORELAI: For the room.",
        "LUKE: What room?",
        "LORELAI: For the thing, for the afterwards thing. . .",
        "LUKE: Oh, wait, now, you're talking crazy talk trying to confuse me, aren't you?",
        "LORELAI: Aren't you?",
        "LUKE: What?",
        "LORELAI: Who?",
        "LUKE: Stop.",
        "LORELAI: Bye.",
        "LUKE: Uh, hold on a sec! I agreed to this under coercion.",
        "LORELAI: You said yes on your own.",
        "LUKE: I said yes because when I said no you talked baby talk loudly in front of all my customers until I got so sick of it I just agreed to do it to shut you up.",
        "LORELAI: I'm incorrigible!",

I recognize a lot of you from over the years and you're all getting taller and older \u0096 stop it. Anyhow, as some of you know, I run the Independence Inn. Sounds simple, running an inn. Well, the sentence is simple, the job is not. Like most jobs, mine involves many other people, people it is my job to hire, to train, and to inspire because when you have good employees it makes you look good.

Um, although, uh, if that happens, um, you know. . . it shouldn't. I mean, it could but you should try to avoid it. . . um, anyway, uh, I got my GED, yeah.",

Look, I know you're at an age where the whole girl thing is. . .you know, on your mind a lot, and it's probably not helping you to think straight with all the hormones and other things that are raging around in there. My point is that you gotta think about things a little better, you know, the way you act. I mean, if you care about a girl the way you do with this Shane \u0096",

        "JESS: Relax, will ya? All is good.",
        "LUKE: Jess, this isn't right. You can't treat a girl like this, like dirt!",

        "LUKE: And that's fine with you?",
        "JESS: Yes, it is.",
