        "OPEN IN LORELAI'S FRONT YARD",
        "[An airport shuttle van drops Lorelai and Rory off in front of their house, then pulls away]",
        "LORELAI: Agh!",
        "RORY: And we're home.",
        "LORELAI: How long does a freakin' van ride take?",
        "RORY: Not that long!",
        "LORELAI: Everybody in the world's life flashed before my eyes. That's how much time I had. I thought we were gonna die on that van.",
        "RORY: It seemed a good possibility.",
        "LORELAI: Ugh, that van ride felt longer than our train ride from Paris to Prague, and we had that group of French boys singing Sk8er Boi and smelling like a soccer field sitting all around us.",
        "[Babette comes out of her house and rushes over to them]",
        "BABETTE: Oh my God, you're back! Morey, they're back! Are you hurt? Are you bleeding?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, we're fine.",
        "BABETTE: You're fine? They're fine! Morey!",
        "MOREY: [opens his front door] Yeah?",
        "BABETTE: They're fine!",
        "MOREY: Okay. [goes back inside]",
        "BABETTE: What the hell happened to you two? According to the itinerary that Rory gave me, you were supposed to be home on Saturday.",
        "LORELAI: The itinerary that Rory gave you?",
        "BABETTE: So when you girls didn't show up, we panicked! Morey?",
        "MOREY: [opens front door] Yeah?",
        "BABETTE: Didn't we panic?",
        "MOREY: Yeah. [goes inside]",
        "LORELAI: Hey, Morey, you ever thought about just staying out here at times like these?",
        "BABETTE: By Sunday night, I was a complete basketcase. I thought you'd been kidnapped by some crazy Sandinistas or something.",
        "LORELAI: 'Cause the Sandinista movement is so popular in France.",
        "BABETTE: So, finally, I just started calling consulates.",
        "RORY: Consulates?",
        "LORELAI: How many consulates?",
        "BABETTE: Ah, jeez, all of 'em. Anyhow, you're here. Let's go inside, I wanna hear all about Europe. Morey, I'm going in!",
        "MOREY: [calls from his house] Okay.",
        "[Babette goes into Lorelai's house]",
        "LORELAI: You gave her an itinerary?",
        "RORY: I thought it would be good for someone to know where we were.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, you gave her an itinerary and she called every consulate in the world.",
        "RORY: If we were caught smuggling hash over the border and we were thrown in some Turkish prison, wouldn't you want someone to know that we were in Turkey?",
        "LORELAI: Where'd we get this hash we were smuggling?",
        "RORY: You were at a caf\u00e9, you met a guy, he was sweet-talking you, he put the stuff in your purse when you weren't looking.",
        "LORELAI: At least tell me he was cute.",
        "RORY: He was not bad for a hash dealer.",
        "LORELAI: Hm.",
        "[they walk into the house]",
        "BABETTE: [calls from the kitchen] I'm making cocoa!",
        "LORELAI: She's making cocoa 'cause you gave her an itinerary.",
        "RORY: I may have given her the itinerary, but you're the one who got us busted for drug smuggling.",
        "LORELAI: Reality has absolutely no place in our world.",
        "[they walk to the kitchen]",
        "BABETTE: Okay, I wanna hear all about Europe. Come on, tell me, what'd you see?",
        "LORELAI: Well, everything. Uh, Notre Dame, the Roman Baths, St. Peter's Basilica.",
        "RORY: Mom touched the Pope.",
        "BABETTE: You're kidding!",
        "LORELAI: Actually, I just touched his car. Then one of the Swiss guards in the fruity cool clothing busted me.",
        "RORY: Luckily, Mom's fluent in flirting.",
        "LORELAI: And flirting with a guy in a pompom hat and a skirt is quite an accomplishment.",
        "BABETTE: Well, it sounds like you had a terrific trip.",
        "RORY: It was. [Lorelai signals for her to fake a yawn, and Rory does]",
        "LORELAI: Aw, are you okay, hon?",
        "RORY: Yeah, I'm just a little sleepy.",
        "BABETTE: Aw, of course, you girls must be wiped. I'll, uh, get out of here.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, but thanks, Babette.",
        "BABETTE: Well, goodnight, sleep tight. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Morey, I'm coming home! [leaves]",
        "RORY: I'm gonna go unpack.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, unpack tomorrow.",
        "RORY: No, if I leave stuff packed overnight, everything's gonna get gross.",
        "LORELAI: Everything's already gross.",
        "[they walk into Rory's bedroom]",
        "RORY: Ahhh.",
        "[Rory walks to the closet as Lorelai gets on the bed]",
        "LORELAI: Oh my God, your bed feels good.",
        "RORY: Do not get comfortable. I will sleep on top of you if I have to.",
        "LORELAI: Oh man, smell this. [holds up a pillow]",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: I forgot that pillows don't have to smell like feet. You know, I have to say, I think it's good I did this hostel thing in my thirties, and I'll tell you why.",
        "RORY: [hugging the clothes in her closet] I missed you, I missed you all!",
        "LORELAI: If I had done it in my twenties or teens, I would've been na\u00efve enough to think that hostels were exotic and romantic. But once you're in your thirties, you've lived enough to know they're gross and should be avoided at all costs.",
        "RORY: [to her clothes] I had a dream about you in Copenhagen. You were there, and you, and you, and you.",
        "LORELAI: Listen, since we slept on the plane, we should go to sleep now, but get up really early tomorrow. We don't wanna blow this whole week being jet-lagged. We need to establish normal sleeping patterns.",
        "RORY: Fine.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. I'm gonna go take a shower and leave you alone to make out with your sock drawer.",
        "RORY: Close the door.",
        "[Lorelai leaves. Rory pulls open her sock drawer]",
        "RORY: Hello, boys.",
        "[opening credits]",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "[Rory is organizing the souvenirs in the living room. Lorelai walks down the steps talking on the phone]",
        "LORELAI: [on phone] Gilmore, Lorelai, yes. My daughter's name is Lorelai also. Well, very confusing or, in your case, extremely convenient. Uh, no, see, we were never missing, it was a big mistake.",
        "RORY: Who are you talking to?",
        "LORELAI: Belgium.",
        "RORY: Ah.",
        "LORELAI: [on phone] Yes, uh huh, Babette Dell. She got our arrival dates mixed up and she was just worried, but we're fine, we're here. We just loved your fries. Okay, sure, bye bye. [hangs up] Okay, Belgium's done, Lisbon's calling me back, Berlin had no idea what I was talking about, and Paris is pissed.",
        "RORY: At who?",
        "LORELAI: Ugh, who knows? Okay, I'm taking a break and then I'm taking on the Netherlands. I still cannot believe Babette did this.",
        "RORY: She just loves us.",
        "LORELAI: Well, be a little less lovable, would you, 'cause it's costing me a fortune. Try being one of those kids where people are like, \"Oh really, she was kidnapped? Hey, well, thin the herd.\"",
        "RORY: Very nice. Hey, who are the rosary beads for?",
        "LORELAI: They're mine.",
        "RORY: What do you need rosary beads for?",
        "LORELAI: They're cute.",
        "RORY: They're for prayer.",
        "LORELAI: Well, pray they match my blue suit?",
        "RORY: They have just upgraded you to a queen-size bed, Jacuzzi tub, junior suite in hell.",
        "LORELAI: Hm. Oh, Pieta placemat?",
        "RORY: Oh, Gypsy.",
        "LORELAI: How are you feeling?",
        "RORY: You know, not bad. Just a little spacy.",
        "LORELAI: Like a cold medicine buzz?",
        "RORY: Maybe we got lucky and missed the jet lag.",
        "LORELAI: I hope so because we have a very big week ahead of us.",
        "RORY: Oh yeah?",
        "LORELAI: Yes. In fact, I have here in my hand a schedule of all the activities we are going to partake in over this week, the final week of Rory Gilmore's life before she enters the ivy-covered hallowed halls of Yale University.",
        "RORY: Schedule, please.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. Today we get these presents out to our friends and then we hit the mall.",
        "RORY: Got it.",
        "LORELAI: Tomorrow we get an early start and we hit three of the crappier movies that are out.",
        "RORY: And then we have dinner at Grandma's.",
        "LORELAI: Which I will conveniently not put down on my list in the hopes that that magically goes away. Uh, okay, the next day we hit New York, see your fancy art galleries, hit the Strand.",
        "RORY: Yes!",
        "LORELAI: Pizza at John's. Um, Sunday, pick up all the stuff you need for school, and then there's a barbecue at Sookie's. Monday is mani/pedi, facial, haircut, go to the psychic, and stock up for Tuesday, the day of all days - Godfather I, II, and III, with extra showings of the Sofia death scene over and over as long as the Mallomars hold out.",
        "RORY: The perfect day!",
        "LORELAI: I agree.",
        "RORY: And I think we have just enough of the biscotti that we brought back from Milan to last us the rest of the week.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, good. Well, everything's in order, so, uh, let's get going and get this stuff out of here.",
        "RORY: Okay.",
        "LORELAI: Wow, we sure have a lot of gifts. Do we like this many people?",
        "RORY: I didn't think so. Maybe we're getting soft in our old age.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, well, I guess we should get some tote bags.",
        "RORY: What tote bags?",
        "LORELAI: We must have tote bags.",
        "RORY: Where would we get tote bags?",
        "LORELAI: Excuse me, every woman who's ever purchased seventy-five dollars worth of Clinique products has some tote bags.",
        "RORY: We don't have tote bags.",
        "LORELAI: Well, how are we supposed to get this stuff out of here?",
        "CUT TO SIDEWALK",
        "[Lorelai and Rory walk down the street wearing their backpacks]",
        "LORELAI: Now we're the quirky backpack ladies.",
        "RORY: One of the kinder nicknames that have been attributed to us.",
        "LORELAI: Let's just be very efficient about this. Okay, we'll start with Patty, work our way clockwise around the town, end with Andrew. And let's stick with the 'my mom touched the Pope' anecdote. It's quick, it's peppy, and everybody likes a nice Pope story.",
        "RORY: Do we have time to stop at Luke's? I'm starving.",
        "LORELAI: Absolutely. This is our week, this week we do anything we want.",
        "RORY: I like this week.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, I wonder if Luke and Nicole actually went on that cruise.",
        "RORY: I thought he was going.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, I know, but I wonder if he actually went.",
        "RORY: Why wouldn't he?",
        "LORELAI: Well, I don't know. Because he'd have to pack and leave, plus he'd have to buy a bathing suit.",
        "RORY: Well, I hope he went. He could use a good vacation. Plus, he really seems to like Nicole.",
        "LORELAI: Mmhmm. Yeah, he does. Oh, hey, looks like the soda shop is open.",
        "RORY: Oh, cool.",
        "[They stop outside the soda shop and see Luke and Taylor arguing inside]",
        "LUKE: I am gonna kill you.",
        "TAYLOR: Oh, please, you are not.",
        "LUKE: I am, too. I'm gonna kill you. I should've killed you before. I should've killed you the minute you put up those unicorn topiaries in the park, but, hey, hindsight, right?",
        "RORY: Aw, I've missed that.",
        "LORELAI: What do you think, biscotti moment?",
        "RORY: Absolutely.",
        "[Lorelai and Rory eat biscotti while they watch Luke and Taylor argue]",
        "TAYLOR: You don't have to yell, Luke.",
        "LUKE: You put a giant window in my wall.",
        "TAYLOR: So what?",
        "LUKE: A giant window! Right here! You can see my entire diner. And when I'm in my diner, I can see your whole stupid store.",
        "TAYLOR: I don't understand why yours is a diner and mine is a stupid store.",
        "LUKE: Look at this place! Look at you. All you need is six dancing penguins and Mary Poppins floating in the corner to bring back two of the worst hours of my childhood.",
        "TAYLOR: I don't think you had a childhood. I think you came out a bitter surly killjoy.",
        "LUKE: You can't change the basic structure of this place without my okay! What?",
        "TAYLOR: Your hand is near the wax lips.",
        "LUKE: So?",
        "TAYLOR: If you could just move it so you don't accidentally touch the candy. Lucas. [Luke rummages through the different boxes of candy] What are you doing? You stop that right now!",
        "LUKE: [throws candy in the air] Look at all the pretty candy!",
        "TAYLOR: Agh, stop it right now!",
        "LORELAI: [gasps] Oh my God!",
        "RORY: Hm, what? What's the matter?",
        "LORELAI: Luke.",
        "RORY: Yeah, he's finally lost it.",
        "LORELAI: No, we forgot Luke.",
        "RORY: We forgot Luke what? Oh, we forgot to bring him back a gift. Oh no!",
        "LORELAI: We kept putting it off and putting it off.",
        "RORY: We couldn't find anything good enough.",
        "LORELAI: We should've gotten him that bullfighter's uniform.",
        "RORY: Well, so what do we do?",
        "LORELAI: Well, we have to just pick up something here and we'll tell him that we got it in Denmark.",
        "RORY: Pick up what?",
        "LORELAI: Something.",
        "RORY: What? This is Stars Hollow. Everything you buy here has a Hello, Kitty stamped on the bottom.",
        "LORELAI: Well, we have to get him something. We cannot go into Luke's empty handed.",
        "RORY: Great.",
        "LORELAI: Come on.",
        "RORY: I'm hungry.",
        "CUT TO SOOKIE AND JACKSON'S HOUSE",
        "[Lorelai and Rory walk up to the house]",
        "LORELAI: Hey, Sookie!",
        "[Sookie rushes off the porch to greet them]",
        "SOOKIE: [squeals] You're back!",
        "LORELAI: We're back!",
        "[they all hug; Jackson comes out of the house]",
        "JACKSON: Hey, don't squish baby!",
        "SOOKIE: I missed you so much!",
        "LORELAI: We missed you so much.",
        "SOOKIE: Ah, look at you! You look older.",
        "RORY: Oh, thanks, Sookie.",
        "SOOKIE: So how was it, was it wonderful?",
        "LORELAI: Oh -",
        "SOOKIE: I wanna hear everything you did and everything you ate. Oh, was it warm? I read it was warm. How was Barcelona? Did you see the gaudy apartments? Ooh, did you see a bullfight? Did you see Anne Frank's house? Did you cry? Was Steven Speilberg there, huh? Oh, hey, I hear you touched the Pope! Are you hungry? Do you want anything to eat? I've got quiche.",
        "[they walk into the house]",
        "LORELAI: Hold on one sec here, missy. I need to look at you. Sideways, please.",
        "SOOKIE: Okay.",
        "LORELAI: Hello, hi, nice to see you. I'm your Auntie Lorelai, and this is your Auntie Rory. Say hi, Rory.",
        "RORY: Hey.",
        "LORELAI: Come over here.",
        "RORY: Oh, no, I'm good.",
        "SOOKIE: Come on, Rory, rub my stomach.",
        "RORY: I'd rather not.",
        "LORELAI: Rory's a chicken.",
        "SOOKIE: So is Jackson.",
        "JACKSON: Hey, I'm gonna like it when it comes out.",
        "LORELAI: So what did the ultrasound say, boy or girl?",
        "SOOKIE: It's a -",
        "JACKSON: Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh.",
        "LORELAI: It's a buh? What's a buh?",
        "JACKSON: [reveals a button pinned to his shirt] Read.",
        "LORELAI: [reads button] \"I do not want to know the s*x of my baby.\"",
        "JACKSON: That's right. I'm going old school on this.",
        "SOOKIE: And he's being completely stubborn.",
        "RORY: But you know?",
        "SOOKIE: Of course I know. I had little clothes to buy -",
        "JACKSON: Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh!",
        "SOOKIE: What? I said nothing about the s*x.",
        "JACKSON: You said little, and now I know it's going to be little.",
        "LORELAI: Jackson, seriously, you don't wanna know?",
        "JACKSON: Hey, in the old days, the guys would pace back and forth in the waiting room until a pretty nurse in a nice white outfit would come out and say, \"Congratulations - it's a 'insert your chosen s*x here'.\" Ricky Ricardo didn't know, Dick van Dyke didn't know, and by gum, if it was good enough for Rick and Dick, it's good enough for me.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I wanna know.",
        "JACKSON: Rory, what do you say? Be on my side.",
        "SOOKIE: Jackson, there are no sides.",
        "JACKSON: We can be in that waiting room together, pacing, waiting, we'll get you a nice suit. What do you say?",
        "RORY: Okay, sure. I'm on Jackson's side.",
        "JACKSON: Great. Welcome to 1954. [gives her a button]",
        "RORY: Happy to be here.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I wanna know.",
        "SOOKIE: Come on, I'll tell you outside.",
        "LORELAI: Sure you don't wanna go?",
        "RORY: Read the button, missy.",
        "LORELAI: Okay.",
        "[Lorelai and Sookie leave]",
        "RORY: So, you hear about that whole Sputnik thing?",
        "JACKSON: Oh, Eisenhower's on top of it.",
        "RORY: Hm.",
        "CUT TO OUTSIDE",
        "[Lorelai and Sookie walk out back to the shed]",
        "LORELAI: So Jackson's really not gonna be in the delivery room with you?",
        "SOOKIE: Nope.",
        "LORELAI: Does that bug you?",
        "SOOKIE: Hey, I don't like Jackson to see me shave my legs, so. . .I'm opening the shed! Okay, are you ready?",
        "LORELAI: For what?",
        "[Sookie opens the shed; it's filled with blue baby products]",
        "LORELAI: [gasps] It's a boy!",
        "SOOKIE: It's a boy!",
        "LORELAI: Oh, Sookie, you're having a boy!",
        "SOOKIE: I know! Jackson will finally have that son to prune the trees with.",
        "LORELAI: My God, it's so exciting. A boy! Oh, a little boy. I know nothing about little boys.",
        "SOOKIE: Me neither.",
        "LORELAI: Man, you're prepared, aren't you?",
        "SOOKIE: Yes, I am.",
        "[They sit down in chairs in the shed]",
        "LORELAI: It's so nice to be home.",
        "SOOKIE: It's nice to have you home.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, have you seen Luke lately?",
        "SOOKIE: Briefly.",
        "LORELAI: I guess he went on that cruise, huh?",
        "SOOKIE: Yup.",
        "LORELAI: That's good. That's good he went. He needed a vacation. He works hard, that one. Always cooking, making the coffee, taking the orders.",
        "SOOKIE: You know, I think something happened on that trip of his.",
        "LORELAI: What do you mean?",
        "SOOKIE: Well, the day he got back, Jackson and I went into the diner and I asked him how his trip went. He couldn't get away from me fast enough.",
        "LORELAI: Really? Was Jackson wearing that creepy button?",
        "SOOKIE: Nope. Luke just seemed kind of freaked out about something.",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "SOOKIE: I don't know.",
        "LORELAI: You think he and Nicole had a fight or something?",
        "SOOKIE: I don't know.",
        "LORELAI: He didn't say anything?",
        "SOOKIE: Nope. He just walked around acting weirder than normal.",
        "LORELAI: Huh. Wonder what that's all about. So. . . are you gonna name him Lorelai?",
        "SOOKIE: Absolutely. That wouldn't be confusing at all.",
        "LORELAI: Great.",
        "CUT TO SIDEWALK",
        "[Lorelai and Rory walk down the street. Lorelai is carrying a jar of jam.]",
        "RORY: I cannot believe you.",
        "LORELAI: What? It's the perfect gift for Luke. Fine fancy jam from France.",
        "RORY: Fine fancy jam from Jackson's pantry.",
        "LORELAI: I don't know what you're talking about. I am looking right here at this beautiful hand-crafted label and it says \"Fruits de la Terre.\"",
        "RORY: You didn't even spellcheck to make sure you got the French right.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, well, I think it adds an authentic touch. See, in my world, the person who made this jam was an illiterate orphan. . .Sochelle.",
        "RORY: As in Sochelle Crab.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, exactly. Sochelle was born by the sea, or so said the note left in the bassinet when the nuns found her on the steps of Notre Dame.",
        "RORY: Oh, good, there are nuns.",
        "LORELAI: Every sad story needs nuns. Anyhow, Sochelle had nothing - no father, no mother, no friends, no education. All she had was a burning desire to make great jam, and now she's the most successful jamstress in Paris.",
        "RORY: Luke's gonna know.",
