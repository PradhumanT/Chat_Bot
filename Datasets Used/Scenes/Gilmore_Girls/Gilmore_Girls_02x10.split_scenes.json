        "[Lorelai and Rory are building a snowman in the center of town.]",
        "LORELAI: How do you like that mouth?",
        "RORY: Um, it's not very mouthlike.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, I think it works.",
        "RORY: It's tilted to the side.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, no, it was intentional. It gives her a unique expression.",
        "RORY: Like she had a stroke?",
        "LORELAI: Fine, I'll just use the Mrs. Potato Head lips.",
        "RORY: No, forget it, leave stroke-mouth. It's not like we're gonna win this anyway.",
        "LORELAI: Whoa, bad attitude.",
        "RORY: Mom, face it. That is the single most incredible snowman I have ever seen. [looks at a man working on an elaborate snow sculpture]",
        "LORELAI: I'm sorry, that snowman is way over the top, way too showy. It's screaming 'I'm incredible, I'm special, look at me.'",
        "RORY: Kind of the point of a snowman-building contest.",
        "LORELAI: Hmm, I hate this man with every fiber of my being.",
        "RORY: He looks nice.",
        "LORELAI: He's a ringer.",
        "RORY: How do you figure?",
        "LORELAI: Someone recruited him, promised him a handsome sum, financed his theatrical snowman accoutrements, so he could snatch victory away from a deserving local in order to bag the contest prize for himself.",
        "RORY: Seems a little elaborate considering that the prize is a set of new US quarters.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, we're ignoring him now. So, what are we gonna do on your school break?",
        "RORY: A lot of nothing.",
        "LORELAI: Sounds good.",
        "RORY: Plus some homework.",
        "LORELAI: And a lot of movies.",
        "RORY: Oh, we have to rent Godfather 3 on DVD.",
        "LORELAI: You're kidding.",
        "RORY: In the audio commentary, Coppola actually defends casting Sofia.",
        "LORELAI: Now that is fatherly love. What's all this homework you have to do?",
        "RORY: Just stuff for the paper.",
        "LORELAI: What? Why?",
        "RORY: Because Paris wants the first issue back to be a double issue, so we have to prep over break and she says the news never sleeps.",
        "LORELAI: What about Paris, does she ever sleep?",
        "RORY: I think she periodically makes a whirring noise and then just shuts down.",
        "LORELAI: Well, you can't work the whole time.",
        "RORY: I won't, I promise. Oh my God.",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "RORY: He's power buffing.",
        "LORELAI: Aw, now that is just wrong.",
        "RORY: We're competing against the Michelangelo of snow.",
        "LORELAI: And we're Ernest Builds a Snowman.",
        "RORY: We shouldn't look at him anymore.",
        "LORELAI: Heads down, stay focused.",
        "RORY: We can do this.",
        "LORELAI: Absolutely.",
        "[their snowman's head falls off]",
        "RORY: Let's get some coffee?",

        "MICHEL: [oh phone] Yes, you can rent a car in Manhattan and return it in Hartford. That's that's no problem, sir. Yes. Yes, you can return it to Bradley International. That's that's very convenient. Or you you can um, you - hold please. [puts phone down, walks over to Rune and grabs his arm]",
        "RUNE: Ah!",
        "MICHEL: Stop that.",
        "RUNE: Stop what?",
        "MICHEL: Stop jumping like a Mexican bean.",
        "RUNE: Well, Lorelai asked me to dust the picture frames. How do you suggest that I clean the top, smartie? [Michel takes the picture off the wall] Well, I didn't know that you could do that.",
        "MICHEL: Yes, I am miraculously talented, aren't I?",
        "RUNE: I thought an alarm would go off like in The Thomas Crown Affair.",
        "MICHEL: That would be if this was a museum, and you were a man allowed in museums.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, no bickering in the lobby, guys.",
        "RUNE: Where are we allowed to bicker?",

        "JACKSON: Once again, I've got it all.",
        "SOOKIE: The matsutake? The makeniya?",
        "JACKSON: Uh wait.",
        "SOOKIE: What?",
        "JACKSON: I don't have makeniya.",
        "SOOKIE: You don't have makeniya?",
        "JACKSON: I don't have makeniya.",
        "SOOKIE: I made it up. [giggles] You passed the test.",
        "JACKSON: Don't test me.",
        "[Lorelai walks in the kitchen]",

        "LORELAI: For the Bracebridge Dinner.",
        "JACKSON: Geez, you guys are going crazy with this dinner.",
        "SOOKIE: Jackson, I told you, this dinner is not just about food. We are recreating an authentic 19th century meal.",
        "LORELAI: The servers are all gonna be in period clothing, they're gonna speak period English. Here, look at the costumes.",
        "JACKSON: Nice.",
        "SOOKIE: We're talking seven courses here. Soup, fish, Peacock Pie, the Baron of Beef, the salad, then the Plum Pudding and the Wassail.",
        "LORELAI: And there's gonna be a big raised platform where the Squire of Bracebridge is going to preside over the festivities.",
        "SOOKIE: Yeah, he tastes the foods and makes pronouncements. He's like the host of the evening, and his costume is the coolest.",
        "LORELAI: Ah.",
        "JACKSON: It all sounds great.",
        "SOOKIE: Oh, it is, it is. By the way, you're playing Squire Bracebridge. Ready?",
        "LORELAI: Let's go.",
        "SOOKIE: Yeah. [they leave]",
        "JACKSON: Huh? What was that?",
        "CUT TO LOBBY",
        "SOOKIE: What are we looking at today?",
        "LORELAI: Okay, this is the last on our list. We've already got our trumpets, our madrigal singers",
        "JACKSON: Uh, sorry to interrupt but I'm not playing Squire Bracebridge.",
        "LORELAI: We've got all our servers lined up. This is just for recorder players and harpists. Hi. Uh, lay some on us guys.",
        "[two recorder players play]",
        "SOOKIE: Hey, you cats really know how to blow those things.",
        "LORELAI: You've got the gig. I will call you later with the details. Thanks.",
        "[the recorder players leave]",
        "JACKSON: So are we clear on this? I'm not playing Squire Bracebridge. Sorry you were under the impression that I'd do this.",
        "SOOKIE: When do the guests arrive?",
        "LORELAI: Thursday at four - on their own jet.",
        "SOOKIE: After buying out the whole inn.",
        "LORELAI: Must be nice to have money.",
        "SOOKIE: Uh! Hey, you know what struck me today?",
        "JACKSON: Was it the fact that I'm not the Squire - did that strike you?",
        "SOOKIE: We are crazy for doing this.",
        "LORELAI: We're beyond crazy. We are 'Anne Heche speaking her secret language to God and looking for the spaceship in Fresno' crazy.",
        "SOOKIE: Oh Quiness, nokka don atta.",
        "LORELAI: Il ek notra doska donne.",
        "JACKSON: And springing this on me at the last minute too, I mean, that's just manipulative.",
        "[a chef comes out of the kitchen]",
        "CHEF: Sookie, fire! [leaves]",
        "SOOKIE: I gotta get back in the kitchen. You'll handle the harp?",
        "LORELAI: You got it.",
        "JACKSON: All right, okay, I'll do it. I'll play Squire Bracebridge if that's what you want. Geez.",
        "SOOKIE: Thanks Sweetie. [walks to kitchen]",
        "JACKSON: As long as it's not just because I fit the costume. It's because I fit the costume, isn't it? [leaves]",
        "LORELAI: [to harpist] Go ahead.",

        "LORELAI: Uh oh.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: It's not an uh oh, I just wanted to run an idea by you.",
        "LORELAI: Run it.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Now it's totally your call and I don't want to step on any plans you've already made, but I know Rory has a break in school coming up, and I was wondering if you'd be cool with her coming to visit for a couple of days.",
        "LORELAI: Uhh, a couple of days? You mean she'd stay the night?",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, it's totally your call. Where are you, heaven?",
        "LORELAI: Do you even have room for someone to stay?",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Not just room - a room. A designated guest room. Sherry fixed it up really nice.",
        "LORELAI: Aww, good for her.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: So what do you think?",
        "LORELAI: I don't know. It's awfully last minute.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: It's totally last minute. You can say no and there'll be no hard feelings.",
        "LORELAI: Well, it's really up to Rory to say yes or no.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: So you're cool with it?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, sure, if Rory is, yeah.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Great, that's great. Uh, thank you. I'll let you run it past her and you can get back to me whenever. No pressure.",
        "LORELAI: No pressure.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Talk to you later.",

        "LORELAI: You and mom, you always go out of town this time of year.",
        "RORY: Last year it was the Bahamas.",
        "RICHARD: Yes, that's right, it was.",
        "LORELAI: I remember you had fun too. You said the Bahama mians were real nice. The Bahamites? The Bahamamamamians?",

        "EMILY: They were nice.",
        "LORELAI: So, what are your plans?",
        "EMILY: We're not going anywhere this year.",
        "RORY: Why not? Oh, well yeah, it can be really nice just to stay at home sometimes because you can do fun things that you normally wouldn't have time for.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, like play Running Charades, and get out that Slip 'n Slide.",
        "RICHARD: We'll see.",
        "EMILY: Yes, we'll see.",
        "RICHARD: Would you all excuse me? I have to make some calls. Say goodbye before you leave, will you?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, sure Dad.",
        "[Richard leaves]",
        "LORELAI: When is this awfulness with work gonna resolve itself?",
        "EMILY: I don't know. The man is so sensitive. He reads so much into every little perceived slight.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah. I remember one time when I was a kid, Dad had put on some weight, and he bought a new suit to try to cover it up. And he wore it for us and he said, 'How do I look?' and I said, 'You look fat.' [pause] But I guess that wasn't really a perceived slight so, I'll think of another example.",

        "[Sookie is lecturing to a group of people; Kirk is transcribing everything she says on his laptop.]",
        "SOOKIE: Keep in mind during the Bracebridge Dinner, we are not just servers, we are performers, so any time you're with a guest, you must be in character and you must speak Old English. It's a world we're creating here, so whatever we can do Kirk, you're driving me crazy!",
        "KIRK: Who me? [reads transcript] 'Whatever we can do to Kirk you're driving me crazy.' Yeah, me. Ah, sorry.",
        "SOOKIE: Okay, now guys, look at the materials I gave you, and tell me if a guest asks you how the food's coming, what would be the appropriate Old English response? Rune!",
        "RUNE: Greetings!",
        "SOOKIE: You just read the first thing on the list, didn't you?",
        "RUNE: Maybe.",

        "JACKSON: Rune, don't be an idiot.",
        "RUNE: Well, this is stupid.",
        "JACKSON: Shut up and pay attention to Sookie. She worked very hard to bring this about.",
        "KIRK: Yes, but unfortunately we don't all share intimacies with her, so she doesn't cut us any slack.",
        "JACKSON: She doesn't treat me differently.",
        "KIRK: She's called you Peaches three times. It's all in the transcript.",
        "RUNE: Sookie, instead of talking in Old English, can I just talk like an old man?",
        "SOOKIE: What?",
        "RUNE: Hey you kids, get off my lawn!",
        "SOOKIE: No, no you cannot just talk like an old man.",

        "SOOKIE: Oh, that makes me so mad. And so sad. I'm smad!",
        "RUNE: Sookie, does this mean that my pockets wileth not with money get choked? That sounded like Old English. Cool, huh?",

        "[Lorelai, Sookie, and Rory are sitting at a table]",
        "SOOKIE: I've got thirty pounds of aged beef, trays and trays of trout, mountains of pruned tarts. I diced pumpkins until my hands turned orange. I've got pumpkin hands.",
        "LORELAI: Take a sip",
        "SOOKIE: How can you stay so calm about this?",
        "LORELAI: There's nothing we can do about it.",
        "RORY: I can't believe they got snowed in.",
        "LORELAI: All that work, all that extra help we hired. Oh well. At least they paid for it already. We didn't lose any money.",
        "SOOKIE: Yeah I guess. You know, I could still make up the dinner for the three of us.",
        "RORY: Yeah, but then it would be like the three of us, all alone in the dining room.",
        "LORELAI: It would be like The Shining, except instead of Jack Nicholson, we have Rune.",

So, I arranged to meet the CEO yesterday just to talk about the situation and about the rumors I'd heard floating around. So I met with Floyd. We shook hands, had coffee, then I started telling him about how unhappy I'd become. I detailed all my years with the company, all the travel I'd done, all the weekends I put in, the sacrifices I'd made, including time with my family, for the firm. And the more I talked, the angrier I became, and then suddenly I heard myself resign, just like that. Floyd was stunned. I'd never seen Floyd stunned. I enjoyed seeing Floyd stunned. So I finished my coffee and I walked out of that office, and I couldn't believe what I'd just done. I'd resigned, quit. I believe I even used a little profanity in the process. But you know what Emily? I was thrilled, elated, a giant weight had been lifted off my chest. I noticed Floyd's secretary staring at me, and I realized it was because I was smiling. Well, nobody had seen me smile there in a very long time. I was. . .I was happy.",

And you like order, you like lists, you like to know where you're going or what's coming. You like all things planned. And then suddenly I impulsively unplan our entire future in one fail swoop. Well, I couldn't face disappointing you again. I couldn't face telling you that I'd spoiled the plan. Not now, not at this time of year. I didn't want to fight, I didn't want to worry, I just wanted to keep being happy. I'm very, very sorry. Anyhow, um, I've been sitting here going over our financial situation. Now, um, we still have all of our retirement accounts, and our medical coverage is all there, By quitting though, we do forgo some of my pension and some stock options.

So, I arranged to meet the CEO yesterday just to talk about the situation and about the rumors I'd heard floating around. So I met with Floyd. We shook hands, had coffee, then I started telling him about how unhappy I'd become. I detailed all my years with the company, all the travel I'd done, all the weekends I put in, the sacrifices I'd made, including time with my family, for the firm. And the more I talked, the angrier I became, and then suddenly I heard myself resign, just like that. Floyd was stunned. I'd never seen Floyd stunned. I enjoyed seeing Floyd stunned. So I finished my coffee and I walked out of that office, and I couldn't believe what I'd just done. I'd resigned, quit. I believe I even used a little profanity in the process. But you know what Emily? I was thrilled, elated, a giant weight had been lifted off my chest. I noticed Floyd's secretary staring at me, and I realized it was because I was smiling. Well, nobody had seen me smile there in a very long time. I was. . .I was happy."

And you like order, you like lists, you like to know where you're going or what's coming. You like all things planned. And then suddenly I impulsively unplan our entire future in one fail swoop. Well, I couldn't face disappointing you again. I couldn't face telling you that I'd spoiled the plan. Not now, not at this time of year. I didn't want to fight, I didn't want to worry, I just wanted to keep being happy. I'm very, very sorry. Anyhow, um, I've been sitting here going over our financial situation. Now, um, we still have all of our retirement accounts, and our medical coverage is all there, By quitting though, we do forgo some of my pension and some stock options.
