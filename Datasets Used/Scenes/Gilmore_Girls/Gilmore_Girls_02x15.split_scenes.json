        "LORELAI: It still hurts.",
        "RORY: Do you need stitches?",
        "LORELAI: Probably.",
        "RORY: Well, then we should go to a doctor.",
        "LORELAI: No, no doctors. You go into a hospital, you don't come out again.",
        "RORY: Well said, Ida Morgenstern.",
        "LORELAI: I'm starving. I need pancakes.",

        "RORY: Yeah, well, hire somebody.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, well, aren't we suddenly a Rockefeller.",
        "RORY: Well, it's better than you killing yourself.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, I'm fine. I'm just being dramatic. It's what I do.",
        "RORY: No more ladders.",
        "LORELAI: I promise.",
        "RORY: Okay.",
        "LORELAI: I think I have gangrene.",
        "RORY: You do not.",
        "LORELAI: And vertigo.",
        "RORY: Oh boy.",
        "LORELAI: And one leg suddenly feels shorter than the other.",
        "RORY: This is gonna be the Vanity Fair paper cut incident all over again, isn't it?",
        "LORELAI: Wow!",
        "RORY: Leave your bandage alone.",
        "LORELAI: Look, it's turning purple, but a really glowy purple. Look!",
        "RORY: No, thanks.",
        "LORELAI: Hm. Maybe our rain gutters are radioactive or made out of some kind of alien metal so that when I cut my hand I got infected with an extraterrestrial substance which is altering my internal makeup. Ugh, maybe I'll turn into a superhero.",
        "RORY: Maybe.",
        "LORELAI: Like, maybe tomorrow I'll wake up and suddenly be able to shower really fast.",
        "RORY: We'll go pick out your cape after breakfast.",

        "LUKE: It's going fine.",
        "LORELAI: You have a sock on your shoulder. Is it helping you look?",

        "LUKE: Caesar can make you breakfast.",
        "LORELAI: What happened to this place?",
        "LUKE: Nothing.",
        "LORELAI: This is what I always pictured the inside of my head to look like.",
        "LUKE: See if you can find a brown leather ledger.",
        "LORELAI: I've never seen so much stuff. It looks like a white trash Hearst Castle in here.",
        "LUKE: On second thought, I'll find it myself.",
        "LORELAI: Where'd all this come from?",
        "LUKE: Jess. Liz shipped the rest of his stuff last week. He finally unpacked.",
        "LORELAI: Well, he did a very nice job.",
        "LUKE: I know it's crazy now, but I just have to get it all organized, figure out where to put everything, buy another dresser, a portable wardrobe, some storage bins.",
        "LORELAI: Can of gasoline, box of matches.",
        "LUKE: Did I mention that Caesar can cook you breakfast?",
        "LORELAI: But he doesn't make the good fluffy pancakes like you do.",
        "LUKE: Then order eggs.",
        "LORELAI: No! See, I had a near death experience today.",
        "LUKE: Really?",
        "LORELAI: Yes. I almost fell off the roof of my house trying to clean the rain gutters, so I have to have pancakes. Please? I'll help you shower when I become a superhero.",
        "[Jess walks out of the bathroom]",
        "LUKE: You've been in there for two hours.",
        "JESS: Yeah, well my hair just ain't bouncin' and behavin' today.",
        "LUKE: There are other people living here too, you know.",
        "JESS: Huh, learn something new everyday. [leaves]",
        "LORELAI: Well, his people skills are really improving.",

        "LORELAI: How long is that?",
        "LUKE: I don't know.",
        "LORELAI: An estimate.",

        "LORELAI: Did I mention that I almost fell off my roof today?",
        "LUKE: I'd lie down if I could find the bed.",
        "[Lorelai sees the supply ledger and picks it up]",
        "LORELAI: Oh, is this what you're looking for?",
        "LUKE: Yes, great, thank you.",
        "LORELAI: Not unless you make me the pancakes.",

        "LORELAI: Well, I think I'm finally ready to get a tattoo.",
        "RORY: Oh please.",
        "LORELAI: I am.",
        "RORY: You've been saying that for the last five years.",
        "LORELAI: I know, but I mean it this time.",
        "RORY: Fine, what are you getting?",
        "LORELAI: Mel Brooks.",
        "RORY: Why?",
        "LORELAI: What do you mean, why? The Two Thousand Year Old Man, Young Frankenstein, Silent Movie \u0096 you don't think Mel has earned the right to have his face on my butt?",
        "RORY: I am so sorry, Mel.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, he'll love it, trust me. So, rocky road hot fudge sundaes and two cans of whipped cream to go with the movies?",
        "RORY: Trying to give Mel a bigger canvas to work with?",
        "LORELAI: Hey, the man's a legend, he deserves the best.",
        "[As they pass the diner, Lorelai notices Luke inside sitting at a table]",
        "LORELAI: Hey.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: Luke.",
        "RORY: What's he doing?",
        "LORELAI: I'm not sure. Hey, will you go get the ice cream and make sure they give us a ton of maraschino cherries?",
        "RORY: Okay.",
        "LORELAI: Thanks.",
        "CUT TO INSIDE LUKE'S",
        "[Luke is sitting at a table watching a very small television set as Lorelai knocks on the door]",
        "LORELAI: Hey",
        "LUKE: Hey, what are you doing?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, uh, Rory and I just hit the video store. Now we're on our way home to eat a large amount of something you would not approve of.",
        "LUKE: Sounds good.",
        "LORELAI: What are you doing?",
        "LUKE: Oh, watching TV.",
        "LORELAI: Ah. Wow, that's cute. Is this the first time it's been away from its mother?",
        "LUKE: It's a very good TV.",
        "LORELAI: Hm, black and white, coat hanger antenna, really bad reception.",
        "LUKE: It's fine.",
        "LORELAI: Don't you have a fully grown TV upstairs?",
        "LUKE: Yeah, well, Jess is upstairs.",
        "LORELAI: So?",
        "LUKE: So when Jess is upstairs, that means the stereo's blaring and the place is a mess. I just needed a little privacy.",
        "LORELAI: So you came downstairs.",
        "LUKE: Yes.",
        "LORELAI: To sit on an uncomfortable chair in an empty diner that smells like onion rings.",
        "LUKE: Yes.",
        "LORELAI: Calgon, take me away.",
        "LUKE: It was very peaceful until two minutes ago.",
        "LORELAI: Hey Luke, do you ever think that, uh, maybe you should get a bigger apartment?",
        "LUKE: I don't need a bigger apartment.",
        "LORELAI: That place upstairs was your father's office. You turned it into an apartment. It was never meant to be lived in.",
        "LUKE: It's fine.",
        "LORELAI: It's too small for two people. It's too small for one person if they have any kind of life.",
        "LUKE: We'll make due, we just need to organize.",
        "LORELAI: No, you don't need to organize. You need to move.",
        "LUKE: I like my apartment.",
        "LORELAI: It's not just your apartment. Jess lives there also.",
        "LUKE: Jess is fine.",
        "LORELAI: Are you sure? Because he could be pinned down under a box for a year in that place and you wouldn't know it until the neighbors started to complain about the smell.",
        "[Rory walks in]",
        "RORY: Hey Luke.",
        "LUKE: Rory, perfect, get her out of here. Go.",
        "LORELAI: But, uh, okay, fine. I'm leaving. Think about what I said.",
        "LUKE: Oh, hey, did you ever hire anybody to do that work for you?",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "LUKE: The rain gutters.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, no, not yet. Are you offering?",
        "LUKE: No, actually, I was thinking about Jess.",
        "LORELAI: Uh, Jess?",
        "LUKE: Yeah, he's always looking for a little extra cash. He doesn't make that much here, and, you know, I hate to think of where else he might try to get it, so",
        "LORELAI: Huh.",
        "LUKE: I mean, you don't have to pay him the same as would someone else, and you save a little, he keeps busy.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, well, maybe. Um, I actually have to check with a couple of people I'm supposed to hear from, but if they can't do it, then sure.",
        "LUKE: Great, just let me know.",
        "LORELAI: I will. Bye.",
        "CUT TO OUTSIDE",
        "[Lorelai and Rory walk out of the diner]",
        "RORY: So who are all these people you asked to clean out our gutters?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, well, you know.",
        "RORY: I do?",
        "LORELAI: Sh-yeah.",
        "RORY: Remind me.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, well, there's Sid.",
        "RORY: Oh, Sid, right.",
        "LORELAI: And then there's Lou.",
        "RORY: Yeah, a good man, Lou.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, and also Moose. That is, if Doris will let him out of the house again, you know, after that incident at Chicky's bachelor party.",
        "RORY: I thought you said you were gonna give Jess a chance.",
        "LORELAI: I am.",
        "RORY: Then why don't you hire him?",
        "LORELAI: I'm just not very comfortable with him, Rory.",
        "RORY: Well, try and get comfortable.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I don't know if I can.",
        "RORY: But you said - .",
        "LORELAI: I know what I said, but I can't help it.",
        "RORY: How many times do I have to tell you \u0096 .",
        "LORELAI: That I don't know the real Jess?",
        "RORY: You don't.",
        "LORELAI: Well, fine, I don't know him, but I'm not too fond of his stand in.",
        "RORY: People are different once you get to know them. If you'll remember, you weren't too fond of Luke when you first met him.",
        "LORELAI: That's not true.",
        "RORY: You called him Duke for two years just to make him mad.",
        "LORELAI: And let me tell you, it worked.",
        "RORY: But then you guys talked and eventually, time went by, and now you love him.",
        "LORELAI: Well. . .",
        "RORY: I'm just asking you to give Jess that same chance.",
        "LORELAI: Rory, you like him. I don't have to like him.",
        "RORY: Please?",
        "LORELAI: Can I at least call him Tess for a little while?",
        "RORY: You'll give him the job?",
        "LORELAI: I'll give him the job.",
        "RORY: Thank you.",
        "LORELAI: You're welcome. Tell me something.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: Why is it so important to you that I like him?",
        "RORY: Well, I just think that he's Luke's nephew and we like Luke and we eat at Luke's everyday, and we see Jess when we eat there everyday, and that it just might make things nicer if you liked him.",
        "LORELAI: And that's the only reason?",
        "RORY: Yes.",
        "LORELAI: It's all about Luke and the diner?",
        "RORY: Yes.",
        "LORELAI: It has nothing to do with you?",
        "RORY: No.",
        "LORELAI: So you and Jess aren't friends?",
        "RORY: Well, yeah, we're friends.",
        "LORELAI: Uh huh.",
        "RORY: I mean, we're not good friends but we're friends. We're friendly. But that doesn't mean that we're friends in the traditional Webster's dictionary definition of friends.",
        "LORELAI: Right.",
        "RORY: Friendish might be a better term.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, friendish. Got it.",
        "[They pass by a group of walkers that Miss Patty is instructing from a golf cart.]",
        "MISS PATTY: And walk, and walk, and pump your arms and walk. And shoulders back, tucus in, think about that double chin and walk and walk and walk and tummies tight and walk. Match me sweetheart.",
        "CUT TO LUKE'S APARTMENT",
        "[Luke walks in, Jess is asleep, music is blaring.]",
        "LUKE: Jess? [Luke turns the music off] How can anyone sleep through that? It's like the Huns are attacking and you're just \u0096 well, you're oblivious and that's why you can just lie there while the rest of the world is going - . [he knocks over his little television] Great! Dammit! Dammit! Dammit! Dammit!",
        "JESS: Whoa, geez, what the hell?",
        "LUKE: I can't stand it, I'm going crazy. This place is awful. I can't live like this anymore.",
        "JESS: Just relax.",
        "LUKE: I can't relax. I can't sleep. I'm having nightmares about being chased around by boxes with arms and they tackle me and pile clothing on top of my face and secure it around my head with packing tape and I'm just lying there choking while you're sitting in the corner laughing, putting gel in your hair with a switchblade!",
        "JESS: Should I be putting a tongue depressor in your mouth right about now?",
        "LUKE: We're moving.",
        "JESS: What?",
        "LUKE: Tomorrow.",
        "JESS: What are you talking about?",
        "LUKE: I'm talking about you and me going out, getting a paper, and finding a new place to live.",
        "JESS: But I \u0096 .",
        "LUKE: No buts. Ten o'clock tomorrow morning I want you up, washed, moussed, and ready to leave, end of story. Now go back to bed. What?",
        "JESS: I need the music on to sleep.",

        "[The next day, Luke and Jess walk out of an apartment building]",
        "JESS: Forget it.",
        "LUKE: Why, what was wrong with that one?",
        "JESS: It was pink.",
        "LUKE: We can paint it.",
        "JESS: You mean I can paint it.",
        "LUKE: We can paint it together.",
        "JESS: Great, then we can hold hands and skip afterwards.",
        "LUKE: Fine, which one do you like?",
        "JESS: The one before.",
        "LUKE: The one with the two fridges?",
        "JESS: No.",
        "LUKE: Well, the one before was the one with two fridges.",
        "JESS: No, the one we saw before was the one with the cat.",
        "LUKE: I hate cats.",
        "JESS: Well, I don't think the cat came with the place.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, but it had carpeting which means it's always gonna smell like a cat.",
        "JESS: Clean the carpet.",
        "LUKE: Paint the pink.",
        "JESS: Fine, the one next to the bank.",
        "LUKE: Too many windows.",
        "JESS: What?",
        "LUKE: Six windows all on one side, three o'clock in the afternoon \u0096 we're sitting in an oven.",
        "JESS: So we get curtains.",
        "LUKE: Well, you'll have to help me put them up.",
        "JESS: Great, then we can hold hands and skip afterwards.",
        "LUKE: Stop saying that.",
        "JESS: You know what, I don't care. Pick whichever one you want.",
        "LUKE: I'm not picking by myself.",

        "JESS: Fine by me.",
        "LUKE: No space, no privacy.",
        "JESS: I got plenty of privacy.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, because I'm sitting downstairs in the dark watching a two-inch V.",

        "JESS: Great idea.",
        "LUKE: I'll take some Polaroids and you can take a look at them later.",

        "RORY: That is great.",
        "LORELAI: I have selected the perky piggies. You might choose the cheery chickens or the goofy goats.",

        "JESS: Yeah, well, it was this or continue apartment hunting with Luke.",
        "RORY: You're moving?",
        "JESS: I don't know. Luke flipped out last night and next thing I know, he's dragging me all over town banging on pipes and measuring square footage. It's crazy.",
