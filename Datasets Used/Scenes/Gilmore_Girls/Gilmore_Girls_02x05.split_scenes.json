    "Recap": [
        "Luke's sister Liz, afraid that her 17 year old son Jess is headed for trouble, puts him on a bus to Stars Hollow to live with Luke. Lorelai finds out and offers Luke some guidance on the care and feeding of a teenager, but is rebuffed. Undaunted, she hosts a dinner party for Jess, who is sullen and angry with everyone except Rory. At the first opportunity, he takes a beer from the fridge and sneaks out to the back porch. Lorelai finds him and gives him a lecture on how good he has it with Luke. Jess tells her what she can do with her little speech and then leaves. When Luke finds out about Lorelai's meddling, they quarrel and he goes to find Jess. Taylor calls Luke the next day to accuse Jess of stealing money from the bridge fund container at the market. Luke confronts Jess about this accusation, and becomes so frustrated at his response that he shoves him into the lake. Realizing that he needs Lorelai's help, he goes to her house to patch things up, only to find that one of Babette's gnomes is missing. He goes back to the diner, lays down the law to Jess and retrieves Babette's gnome. Paris is intent on making Rory's life miserable, so she sabotages her participation on \"The Franklin\" by giving Rory the wrong time for the staff meeting, and then assigning her to a story on the paving of the new faculty parking lot. Her plan is frustrated when the faculty advisor singles out Rory's article for praise. Undeterred, Paris assigns Rory the job of interviewing Max after she sees Rory and Max painfully avoid each other in the hall. Rory accepts the challenge, and after a few painful moments, Max and Rory express their regrets to each other about not being able to be stepfather and stepdaughter."

        "RORY: How are the eggs?",
        "LORELAI: Good.",
        "RORY: I'm glad.",
        "LORELAI: They're still good.",
        "RORY: I'm still glad.",
        "LORELAI: Look freak, we will not be late.",
        "RORY: It's the first day of school. I wanna get there early.",
        "LORELAI: We will be there early, I promise.",
        "RORY: I have different classes this year, my routes aren't the same. I haven't found the quickest path around. And my locker, they moved it, so I don't even know if it'll work properly and then I'll have to get a new one and God knows how long that'll take or where it'll be and that could send the whole day into chaos. I'm just excited.",
        "[Lane walks into the diner]",
        "LANE: Oh, thank God, you haven't left yet.",
        "RORY: Nope, what's up?",
        "LANE: Well, I found the greatest record store in the world. It's ten minutes from your school and I'm wondering how much you love me.",
        "RORY: Address.",
        "LANE: Record Breaker Incorporated, 2453 Berlin Turnpike.",
        "RORY: Got it. Place your order now.",
        "LANE: Okay, Charles Mingus, \"The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady.\"",
        "LORELAI: Mm.",
        "RORY: Right.",
        "LANE: The Sonics, Here are the Sonics.",
        "RORY: Burn me a copy. Next.",
        "LANE: MC5, Kick Out the Jams. Fairport Convention, Leige and Lief. BeeGees, Odessa.",
        "RORY: BeeGees, really?",
        "LANE: Well, Mojo says.",
        "RORY: So it must be true.",
        "LANE: Okay, that's it. Now if I could just find a copy of Whistler, Chaucer, Detroit and Greenhill, I will finally be done with the sixties.",
        "RORY: I can get there today, tomorrow at the latest.",
        "LANE: I love it when you go back to school.",
        "RORY: Me too. Hey!",
        "LORELAI: I am getting donuts for later. As soon as I do, I will take you to school and the nice men in the white coats will pick you up.",
        "[Lorelai walks up to the counter. Taylor is standing there with a group of Boy Scouts.]",
        "TAYLOR: Everybody, listen up. Decide what you want, place your order, and then proceed to the end of the line.",
        "BOY 1: I want a burger.",
        "BOY 2: I want grilled cheese.",
        "BOY 3: Me too.",
        "BOY 2: And I want fries, and make them really really cripsy.",
        "BOY 1: I want mine crispy too.",
        "BOY 2: You didn't order fries.",
        "BOY 1: So?",
        "LUKE: So you can't order crispy fries without first ordering fries.",
        "BOY 1: Why not?",
        "LUKE: Because you can't make something crispy that doesn't exist.",
        "BOY 1: Why not?",
        "LUKE: Get him away from me Taylor.",
        "TAYLOR: Have some respect. These boys have just completed the first leg of their outdoor survival training.",
        "LUKE: Meaning you had them sit under a tree and glue rocks together for two hours.",
        "TAYLOR: You're a very jaded man Luke. What happened to you as a child?",
        "LUKE: Some creepy guy in shorts and knee socks tried to sit me under a tree and glue rocks together for two hours. Put that down!",
        "BOY 4: Why?",
        "LUKE: Because otherwise you're going under it.",
        "BOY 4: I won't fit.",
        "LUKE: Oh yes you will.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, donuts please.",
        "BOY 1: We were here first!",
        "LORELAI: On the planet?",
        "BOY 1: Huh?",
        "LORELAI: You lose. Chocolate, cinnamon and sprinkles.",
        "[phone rings; Lorelai and the kids moan as Luke goes to answer it.]",
        "LUKE: All of you pipe down.",
        "LORELAI: Grups, huh?",
        "LUKE: [on phone] Yeah, I'm working. What do you think I'm doing? Uh huh. Uh huh. Oh man, what did you do? Excuse me, are you serious? Just like that, huh?",
        "[Lorelai goes behind the counter and gets her own donuts]",
        "BOY 2: Hey Mr. Doose. She's not supposed to do that.",
        "TAYLOR: That's right. She's breaking the rules, and people who break the rules end up very lonely with no friends because they have become society's outcasts.",
        "LORELAI: Planning on burning a little Huck Finn after lunch, Taylor?",
        "TAYLOR: Excuse me?",
        "LUKE: [on phone] This is unbelievable! You won't ever change, will you? . . . Okay, fine. Do what you want, make the arrangements. Now I'm working, we'll finish this later. [hangs up]",
        "LORELAI: Is everything okay?",
        "LUKE: Do you have a sister?",
        "LORELAI: Um, no.",
        "BOY 1: I do.",

        "CUT TO FRONT OF LUKE'S DINER",
        "[Luke walks towards the diner carrying several shopping bags. He drops a bag on the sidewalk. Lorelai is walking by and stops to help.]",
        "LORELAI: Hey.",
        "LUKE: Hello.",
        "LORELAI: What are you doing?",
        "LUKE: Ah, just redecorating the sidewalk.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, it looks nice.",
        "LUKE: Yeah yeah yeah, you don't think too much blue?",
        "LORELAI: No, just enough.",
        "LUKE: Yeah, well, thanks for the input. You can go now.",
        "LORELAI: Need some help?",
        "LUKE: Nope.",
        "LORELAI: Need some help?",
        "LUKE: Nope.",
        "LORELAI: Need some help?",

        "[Luke sighs.]",
        "CUT TO OUTSIDE LUKE'S APARTMENT",
        "[Luke and Lorelai walk down the hallway to Luke's apartment. Luke is carrying the shopping bags, Lorelai is carrying a box of cereal. Luke unlocks the door.]",
        "LORELAI: Frosted Flakes? Since when do you buy Frosted Flakes? [Luke drops some bags, food spills all over.] Okay, now what is going on?",
        "LUKE: Nothing.",
        "LORELAI: Nothing? You just all of sudden woke up this morning and decided you were gonna buy every food item in the world that you don't actually eat?",
        "LUKE: It's not for me.",
        "LORELAI: Well who's it for?",
        "LUKE: Someone who's not me.",
        "LORELAI: Like who?",
        "[cut to inside apartment]",
        "LUKE: Like my nephew.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, your nephew's coming to visit.",
        "LUKE: No, he's coming to stay.",
        "LORELAI: You're sister's moving here?",
        "[they start picking up the spilled food in the hallway and bringing it inside]",
        "LUKE: Nope.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I'm sorry, I don't get it.",
        "LUKE: There's nothing to get. It's just Liz. She's too busy, she can't handle him, she's sending him here.",
        "LORELAI: Where's his dad?",
        "LUKE: Oh well, the great prize that my sister picked up at a Der Wienerschnitzel left her about two years ago, whereabouts unknown.",
        "LORELAI: Aww, geez.",
        "LUKE: Yup.",
        "LORELAI: So she's just sending him here, just like that?",
        "LUKE: Oh no, I'm sure she put at least five or six minutes of thought into it.",
        "LORELAI: But why?",
        "LUKE: Well, 'cause apparently he's been getting into some trouble and Liz is afraid he's heading for something bad, and rather than handle it herself, she's just giving up. She's sending him here so I can straighten him out.",
        "LORELAI: You?",
        "LUKE: Yes.",
        "LORELAI: You can straighten him out?",
        "LUKE: Yes.",
        "LORELAI: You, Luke Danes, the great communicator, you're going to straighten the kid out?",
        "LUKE: All he needs is a change of pace, a new crowd, and to get away from the nutjob that, unfortunately, is my sister.",
        "LORELAI: Well, how long is he staying?",
        "LUKE: I don't know. Indefinitely.",
        "LORELAI: And how old is he?",
        "LUKE: Seventeen.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, wow. That is very generous of you.",
        "LUKE: Well, it's family, what else can you do?",
        "LORELAI: Right. So what kind of trouble has he gotten into?",
        "LUKE: Ah, just kid stuff, you know, staying out late, getting rowdy. I don't know exactly.",
        "LORELAI: Well, you might want to find out. Ask a couple of subtle questions, you know, has he seen The Shawshank Redemption, did the setting seem homey to him? Stuff like that.",
        "LUKE: Look, his problem is obvious, it's his mother. You never could count on Liz for anything. Our mom died when we were kids, right? It was just my dad, me and Liz. And my dad worked all the time and I worked in the store with my dad, and Liz was off doing God knows what.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I bet losing her mom so early was kind of hard on her.",
        "LUKE: It was hard on all of us, but we did our part. And then the minute she graduates high school, she is outta here. Didn't matter that my dad was sick, didn't matter that the store was failing, she just took off. Married the hot dog king, had a kid, he left, now here we are. [Luke starts pumping up an air mattress]",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, wow, that's I'm sorry, what are you doing?",
        "LUKE: I'm blowing this up.",
        "LORELAI: What is it?",
        "LUKE: It's a bed.",
        "LORELAI: A bed?",
        "LUKE: For Jess.",
        "LORELAI: Jess?",
        "LUKE: Jess, my nephew.",
        "LORELAI: Luke, um, that's not a bed, that's a raft, which is fine if you're gonna build a moat around the diner but",
        "LUKE: It's fine.",
        "LORELAI: Luke, the kid needs a bed. If you want to get him something inflatable, make it a blonde.",
        "LUKE: I'm getting him a bed, this is just temporary.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, how does Jess feel about this?",
        "LUKE: I don't know.",
        "LORELAI: You haven't talked to him about it?",
        "LUKE: No.",
        "LORELAI: Don't you think you should?",
        "LUKE: Why? He doesn't have a choice. His mom's a flake, he's coming here, end of story.",
        "LORELAI: Are you sure you're ready for this?",
        "LUKE: Of course I'm sure.",
        "LORELAI: I mean, taking on a full time kid, that's a lot of work.",
        "LUKE: I know.",
        "LORELAI: And a seventeen-year-old that's been getting into trouble and now is being shipped off without his consent, that could be even harder.",
        "LUKE: Look, all he needs is to be around someone who's not a selfish basketcase, who will give him a little space, who will treat him like a man.",
        "LORELAI: Maybe you should think about this.",
        "LUKE: There's nothing to think about. He's family. You take care of family, period.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, I respect that, but what if he turns out to be Fredo?",
        "LUKE: Are you seriously telling me not to do this?",
        "LORELAI: No, I'm not telling you not to do this.",
        "LUKE: Then what are you saying?",
        "LORELAI: I'm just saying that if you need any help, I'm here.",
        "LUKE: Thank you.",
        "LORELAI: You're welcome.",
        "LUKE: Look, I got a lot of things to do before he gets here so",
        "LORELAI: Okay, I'm leaving. Oh, you do have an extra set of sheets, right?",
        "LUKE: Yes, I do.",
        "LORELAI: Sorry, just checking. Bye. [leaves]",
        "LUKE: [grabs keys] Sheets, sheets.",
        "CUT TO CHILTON",
        "[Rory is walking down the hallway towards a classroom. Paris, Madeline and Louise are walking towards the same room from the other direction. They stop in front of the doorway and look at each other before going inside.]",
        "RORY: Okay, round two.",
        "CUT TO INSIDE CLASSROOM",
        "[Rory walks over to Paris.]",
        "RORY: Five seconds?",
        "PARIS: Four.",
        "RORY: Fine.",
        "PARIS: Now it's three.",
        "RORY: Paris, it does not have to be like this.",
        "PARIS: No?",
        "RORY: You and I are going to have to spend a lot of time in class together on The Franklin.",
        "PARIS: I know.",
        "RORY: We're gonna have to sit in the same classroom, share the same oxygen, occasionally make eye contact.",
        "PARIS: I can avoid that.",
        "RORY: Look, I'm not saying that we should be friends. I don't want to be friends. I'm just saying that maybe we should look at this like life.",
        "PARIS: Life?",
        "RORY: Yes, in life there will be people that you don't like, but that you have to coexist with.",
        "PARIS: I am well aware of that.",
        "RORY: So I'm just suggesting that we coexist.",
        "PARIS: You're just scared that I'm gonna make your life on The Franklin a living hell. Especially since I'm the editor and you're oh, what's the word not.",
        "RORY: If you want to spend the precious energy that you'd normally spend on the paper obsessing on ways to make me miserable, then that's your choice. I'm just suggesting an alternate plan. The paper could be really great this year.",
        "PARIS: I know.",
        "RORY: So, can't we just agree on that and make all the rest of it go away?",
        "[Louise and Madeline walk over]",
        "LOUISE: Everything okay?",
        "RORY: Yeah, Riff, everything's fine.",
        "PARIS: We were just talking.",
        "MADELINE: Talking? You two?",
        "PARIS: About The Franklin.",
        "MADELINE: Oh. Nope, still seems weird.",
        "PARIS: Hey, look, we're all on the paper together. There's gonna be a lot of long afternoons and weekends.",
        "LOUISE: Weekends?",
        "PARIS: We need to coexist, right?",
        "RORY: Right.",
        "LOUISE: I'm sorry. Back up to the weekends.",
        "PARIS: So that's what we'll do. Now the first meeting of The Franklin is today.",
        "RORY: Yes it is.",
        "PARIS: Four o'clock.",
        "RORY: Sounds good.",
        "LOUISE: Weekends were never mentioned. I need my weekends. All of this gets done on weekends.",
        "CUT TO BUSSTOP",
        "[Luke is waiting on the bench. The bus pulls up and Jess steps off.]",
        "LUKE: Jess.",
        "JESS: Luke.",
        "LUKE: Okay, so uh [Luke walks towards the diner, Jess follows]",
        "CUT TO LUKE'S DINER",
        "[Luke and Jess walk through the door.]",
        "LUKE: Well, this is my diner.",
        "JESS: Huh.",
        "LUKE: Belonged to your Grandpa.",
        "JESS: Huh.",
        "LUKE: Yup.",
        "CUT TO LUKE'S APARTMENT",
        "[Luke and Jess walk through the door.]",
        "LUKE: Well, here we are. It's pretty simple. You know, this is the room. That's my bed, that's your, uh, bed for now, but the sheets are new. There's the bathroom, there's the closet, there's the dresser, the phone, and over there is the kitchen. I've got Frosted Flakes.",
        "JESS: Wow, that's grrrrreat.",
        "LUKE: So, is that all your stuff?",
        "JESS: Yup.",
        "LUKE: Not much there.",
        "JESS: Well, Lizzie's sending the rest later.",
        "LUKE: So, you need some help?",
        "JESS: Nope.",
        "LUKE: Okay, uh, I have to get back to the diner. I'm gonna close up at ten tonight, so I thought",
        "JESS: See you at ten.",
        "LUKE: But wait, you need keys.",
        "JESS: No I don't. [leaves]",
        "LUKE: I so don't wanna know why.",

        "CUT TO CHILTON",
        "[Rory sits down on a bench to read before the newspaper meeting starts. She hears voices from inside the room and goes inside. Several students and a teacher are sitting at a table.]",
        "PARIS: Pick a side people. Oh, Rory.",
        "RORY: Hey.",
        "TEACHER: Nice of you to join us, Miss Gilmore.",
        "RORY: I thought we were starting at four.",
        "TEACHER: No, we start at 3:15 sharp.",
        "PARIS: Look, we're wasting time here.",
        "TEACHER: Take a seat Miss Gilmore.",
        "RORY: Sorry.",
        "PARIS: Okay, so we were just finishing up handing out the first assignments. Now, Rory, unfortunately, since you got here so late, most everything of interest has been given out.",
        "RORY: Why, I'm shocked.",
        "PARIS: Wait, wait, just let me check my list here. There might be something left for you. Okay, well, here, they're paving the new parking lot tomorrow.",
        "RORY: And?",
        "PARIS: And you can cover it.",
        "RORY: Cover what?",
        "PARIS: The paving process.",
        "RORY: You're serious?",
        "PARIS: Absolutely. I'm sure there's an angle there somewhere. Is it environmentally safe? What are the financial ramifications? Should brick have been considered especially taking into account the architecture of the building?",
        "RORY: Yeah yeah, I get the idea.",
        "PARIS: But hey, if you think this is below you, you can always wait until the next issue. You can just use this time to get a nice manicure.",
        "RORY: That's okay.",
        "PARIS: Maybe get a massage.",
        "RORY: I'll do it.",
        "PARIS: Aromatherapy. Smell like a peach for a few days.",
        "RORY: I said I'll do it, okay? I'll cover the paving.",
        "PARIS: Okay, good. Well then, I guess that's it.",
        "[Everyone gets up from the table. Paris walks to a computer and starts typing. Rory walks over to her.]",
        "PARIS: Problem, Miss Gilmore?",
        "RORY: Nope, no problem at all. I love this assignment.",
        "PARIS: I'm glad.",
        "RORY: I'm gonna write the greatest piece on pavement you've ever read.",
        "PARIS: I hope so.",
        "RORY: And next week, when you give me the scoop on the new copper plumbing installation, I'm gonna be just as thrilled.",
        "PARIS: I like a team player.",
        "RORY: And no matter how many crappy, stupid, useless assignments you throw at me, I'm not going to quit and I'm not going to back down. So you can go home tonight and think about the fact that no matter what you do and no matter how evil you are, at the end of the year, on my high school transcript, it's going to say that I worked on The Franklin. So, if you'll excuse me, I have some reading to do on the origins of concrete.",
        "PARIS: A thousand words on my desk on Tuesday.",
        "[Rory walks out of the room and starts walking down the hallway. Max is coming from the other direction. They stop in front of each other, then both turn around and go the other way. Paris watches from the classroom window.]",

        "LUKE: Oh geez.",
        "LORELAI: Sorry.",
        "LUKE: No, I'll just you want some coffee?",
        "LORELAI: It's okay. I'll just lick it off the table. So?",
        "LUKE: So what?",
        "LORELAI: Is he here?",
        "LUKE: He's here.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah? How is he? [sits at counter]",
        "LUKE: He's fine.",
        "LORELAI: Did he see the bed?",
        "LUKE: He saw the bed.",
        "LORELAI: Well, where is he? I wanna meet him.",
        "LUKE: Oh, he's out.",
        "LORELAI: Out where?",
        "LUKE: I don't know.",
        "LORELAI: You don't?",
        "LUKE: No, he just went out.",
        "LORELAI: You didn't ask him where he was going?",
        "LUKE: No.",
        "LORELAI: Why not?",

        "MAX: And when my mother was pregnant with me, she went through this phase where all she would eat was lamb chops. So Arturo would cut her the extra large lamb chops and only charge her for the regular sized lamb chops, which in my family made you eligible for sainthood.",

        "RORY: How long did that last?",
        "MAX: Junior high. And then slowly I figured out that I wanted to teach. Plus, when you told people that you wanted to be a clown they tended to get very frightened.",
        "RORY: Mom took me to the circus once, when I was really little and, um, this clown knocked into me and I dropped my cotton candy, and we didn't have a lot of money back then so she couldn't buy me another one, and I started crying. So she literally chased the clown on stage, ripped off his wig and said she wouldn't give it back to him unless he bought me another cotton candy.",

        "LORELAI: Luke, slow down. First of all, Jess is seventeen, so I think he's probably past the jam hands stage by now. And second of all, you can do this. If you want to, you are totally capable. But you can't just buy a bed and some sheets and expect the rest to take care of itself. That will not work.",
