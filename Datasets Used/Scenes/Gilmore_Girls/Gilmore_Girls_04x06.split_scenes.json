        "[Lorelai, Rory, Emily, and Richard are eating dinner]",
        "EMILY: It's simply disgraceful.",
        "RICHARD: For years, we've had peace in the neighborhood.",
        "EMILY: I knew the Richmonds were going to be trouble when they missed the block party last month.",
        "LORELAI: I don't understand. They gave out full-size candy bars for Halloween. So what?",
        "EMILY: Not full-size candy bars, Lorelai - king-size candy bars.",
        "RICHARD: We've been giving out full-size candy bars for years now.",
        "EMILY: And then those people move in and throw the entire balance of the neighborhood off. They made everybody look ridiculous.",
        "RICHARD: It's very embarrassing.",
        "EMILY: I think we have to do something about this - maybe go to the homeowners association.",
        "LORELAI: Two Halloweens ago, someone painted the Duprees' Chihuahua orange and nobody went to the homeowners association then.",
        "EMILY: Well, everybody hated Taco.",
        "LORELAI: I think you're making a little too much of this.",
        "EMILY: I saw Mae Richmond at Bay Wellington's two weeks before Halloween. She had ample time to bring it up then, and nothing - not a word. I think it might be time to go after their ball machine.",
        "RORY: Their ball machine?",
        "RICHARD: They have a ball machine on their tennis court that is extraordinarily loud and unpredictable.",
        "EMILY: Flying, thumping balls all over the place.",
        "LORELAI: Flying, thumping what all over the place?",
        "EMILY: Balls.",
        "[Lorelai giggles]",
        "EMILY: You are four.",
        "LORELAI: And balls are funny.",
        "RICHARD: Don't worry, Emily. If the homeowners association doesn't do anything, we'll take this to the neighbors, get a petition going.",
        "LORELAI: Or if that doesn't work, you could throw some hoods on and burn a full-size Mars bar on their front lawn.",
        "EMILY: King-size, Lorelai - king-size.",
        "RORY: So, how's work, Grandpa?",
        "LORELAI: Look how smoothly she changes the subject.",
        "RICHARD: Work is lovely, Rory. How's school?",
        "RORY: Crazy.",
        "LORELAI: She's taking too many courses.",
        "RORY: I am not.",
        "EMILY: How many are you taking?",
        "LORELAI: Five.",
        "EMILY: Is five a lot?",
        "RORY: It's not a lot",
        "LORELAI: It is a lot.",
        "RICHARD: I took five courses when I was a freshman. Rory takes after me.",
        "RORY: I like to be busy.",
        "RICHARD: Idle hands are the devil's playthings.",
        "LORELAI: That's actually the title of one of her classes.",
        "RORY: Please don't worry about me.",
        "LORELAI: She says to the mother and the grandmother.",
        "EMILY: Are you done?",
        "RORY: Oh, yes, thank you.",
        "EMILY: Good, because we have mini lemon bundt cakes for dessert.",
        "LORELAI: Oh.",
        "EMILY: What?",
        "LORELAI: Well, they're serving full-size bundt cakes over at the Richmonds' house.",
        "EMILY: She's done.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, no, I have a carrot.",
        "EMILY: She's done.",
        "LORELAI: Bet the Richmonds would have let me eat my carrot.",

        "[Emily walks into Richard's study, where a photographer is setting up to take a picture of Richard and Jason]",
        "EMILY: All right, this should do it.",
        "RICHARD: May we please get this over with?",
        "EMILY: Patience is a virtue, Richard.",
        "RICHARD: And time is fleeting, Emily.",
        "EMILY: You're starting a new partnership. You need new photographs, especially with that new look.",
        "JASON: I thought I'd give a beard a try.",
        "EMILY: Well, I like it. All right, Helmut, we're all set here.",
        "HELMUT: Okay. Important men doing important things. [takes a picture] Good. Oh, one more time. We're going to sign, and. . .[takes another picture] We're done.",
        "EMILY: Thank you, Helmut. That was wonderful.",
        "RICHARD: And now we sign the real papers.",
        "JASON: I'm feeling historic. You?",
        "RICHARD: Oh, yes. It's Gettysburg all over again. Thank you.",
        "JASON: Important men doing important things.",
        "RICHARD: Now that makes it official. Jason.",
        "JASON: Let's give 'em hell.",
        "RICHARD: You bet.",
        "EMILY: Oh, I should have had Helmut get the handshake.",
        "RICHARD: The signing was fine, Emily. Sorry about the photo session.",
        "JASON: Oh, no, that's okay. I think it's a cute idea.",
        "EMILY: Yes, and when the financial papers call for an official photo, it'll be downright darling.",
        "RICHARD: I learned long ago, Jason, when it comes to things like this, Emily is always right.",
        "JASON: I am sure she is.",
        "EMILY: Thank you both. Jason, how's your time? Would you like to join us for dinner?",
        "JASON: Oh, I'd love to, Emily, but I should get these papers up to my lawyer's office. Next week?",
        "EMILY: Consider it an open invitation.",
        "JASON: Thank you. Richard, I'll see you tomorrow morning.",
        "RICHARD: Yes, you will.",
        "[Jason leaves]",
        "EMILY: \"I think it's cute.\"",
        "RICHARD: He's young, Emily.",
        "EMILY: Yes, well, a good smack on that scruffy face of his would age him up a bit. All right, let's discuss the launch party. Do you have any sort of particular feel in mind?",
        "RICHARD: Well, I'll leave that to your discretion. Just make sure it's dignified.",
        "EMILY: We probably shouldn't go too fancy. Maybe we'll do one of those vodka bars - caviar, a Russian theme. I love that it's okay to be Russian again.",
        "RICHARD: It sounds lovely.",
        "EMILY: How's the 23rd?",
        "RICHARD: Perfect.",
        "EMILY: And I want you to get a new suit.",
        "RICHARD: I don't need a new suit.",
        "EMILY: And find out what Jason's going to wear. I don't want the two of you showing up looking like the Bobbsey twins.",
        "RICHARD: Oh, yes, that would be embarrassing.",
        "EMILY: I'll need a guest list.",
        "RICHARD: Uh huh.",
        "EMILY: A Russian theme. I like that.",
        "CUT TO YALE CLASSROOM",
        "[Rory is in one of her classes]",
        "PROFESSOR: The conquering peoples impose their own values on the subjugated peoples through education, and quite often through the appointment of a priesthood from among their own ranks. This means we should not assume that the system of values has in some way evolved in a region. It is almost always imposed with the explicit purpose of keeping power in the hands of the powerful. Something to think about until next week, when we will burst more of your illusions. . .which brings me to a bit of bad news. There was an error in the syllabus you received. The dates were wrong, which means that all of your reading has been pushed up one week. I apologize for this cruel little life experience, but what can I do? I just found out my in-laws are moving back to town. None of us are immune. I'll see you all Tuesday.",
        "CUT TO THE DRAGONFLY INN",
        "[The construction crew is working on the inn. Lorelai and Tom walk over to the barn.]",
        "LORELAI: So, we were thinking maybe two horses to start with. See, it's so charming with the overhang here.",
        "TOM: You want me to turn this into stables?",
        "LORELAI: Yes.",
        "TOM: Without a magic wand or some sort of fairy dust?",
        "LORELAI: Preferably, yes.",
        "TOM: Let me take a look inside.",
        "LORELAI: We'd like to keep the existing structure, please.",
        "KIRK: Lorelai, I'm all set up as soon as you're ready.",
        "LORELAI: Be right there, Kirk.",
        "KIRK: Okie dokie.",
        "TOM: How attached are you gonna get to these horses?",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "TOM: You gonna name 'em, feed 'em apples, braid their tails?",
        "LORELAI: Why, Tom?",
        "TOM: Well, the roof's about to cave in so I can stay within our budget, but then I'd just call 'em all Trigger.",
        "LORELAI: Just tell me how much more it's gonna cost.",
        "TOM: Okay.",
        "[Sookie arrives]",
        "SOOKIE: Hey, you're here.",
        "LORELAI: I'm always here.",
        "SOOKIE: Listen, I want to talk to you about something very exciting.",
        "LORELAI: Ooh, very exciting. I love very exciting.",
        "SOOKIE: This morning I got a call from your mother.",
        "LORELAI: This is the very exciting?",
        "SOOKIE: Yes! She's doing a launch party for your father's new business and she wants us to do the catering.",
        "LORELAI: Us?",
        "SOOKIE: Us!",
        "LORELAI: Did you say us?",
        "SOOKIE: Yes.",
        "LORELAI: To her. Did you say \"us\" to her?",
        "SOOKIE: Yes.",
        "LORELAI: So she knows about us?",
        "SOOKIE: Yes, she knows about us, I think. What does she know about us?",
        "LORELAI: That we have a catering business?",
        "SOOKIE: Yes.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, man!",
        "SOOKIE: What? Did I do something bad?",
        "LORELAI: No, nothing, nothing. It's my fault. I forgot to tell her.",
        "SOOKIE: How could you forget to tell her?",
        "LORELAI: Well, I've only seen her forty or fifty times since we started the business. Now what did she say exactly?",
        "SOOKIE: Well, she asked me to cater, and I said we'd love to, and then she said, \"we?\" so I said you and I had started a company, so it'd be the both of us together, and she said fine.",
        "LORELAI: Was there a pause before \"fine\" or was it just \"fine\"?",
        "SOOKIE: I don't remember. I just remember the \"fine.\"",
        "LORELAI: She's mad.",
        "SOOKIE: I swear she didn't sound mad.",
        "LORELAI: Okay.",
        "SOOKIE: Good.",
        "LORELAI: Now let's talk about how much I can't do this.",
        "SOOKIE: Look, I knew it would be a thing working for your mother, but it's perfect timing. This is probably the last job we'll be able to take before I have the baby.",
        "LORELAI: Something else will come along.",
        "SOOKIE: Not that pays like your mother does.",
        "LORELAI: You know why she pays so much? So she can torture you and you won't throw knives at her.",
        "SOOKIE: Look, you already know the house. Decorating, planning - it's gonna be a snap for you. I bet you can spend ninety percent of the evening in the kitchen, then we get to take home the pretty, pretty money.",
        "LORELAI: Sookie.",
        "SOOKIE: Pretty, pretty money. Aren't you a big fat wad of pretty money?",
        "LORELAI: Fine.",
        "SOOKIE: Really?",
        "LORELAI: Shouldn't ask again.",
        "SOOKIE: Accepting and moving on.",
        "KIRK: Excuse me, Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, my God, Kirk, I forgot you were here.",
        "KIRK: If I had a nickel for every time I heard that.",
        "LORELAI: I'm very, very sorry. You have my full attention.",
        "SOOKIE: I'm gonna go. Um, we'll talk tomorrow about the details.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. All right, Kirk, show me what you got.",
        "KIRK: If you'll just follow me, I would like to present you with my new line of one-of-a-kind mailboxes.",
        "LORELAI: Wow. They look very nice, Kirk.",
        "KIRK: And whimsical. They say to the world, \"I'll take my mail with a smile.\"",
        "LORELAI: Yes, they do say that.",
        "KIRK: And since you are one of our preferred customers, with the purchase of one of our mailboxes, I'll throw in a carved-duck doorstop and a garlic peeler.",
        "LORELAI: Wow, that's quite an offer, Kirk, but I think it's a little early for me to pick a mailbox. We haven't even settled on a color for the inn yet.",
        "KIRK: Well, whimsy goes with everything.",
        "LORELAI: Kirk, I promise, just as soon as. . .is that Condoleezza Rice?",
        "KIRK: Yes, it is. I'm a fan, and her big mouth is perfect for shoving mail in.",
        "LORELAI: Ha. Uh, I'll have to think about it.",
        "KIRK: Fair enough. So, I hear you're running a catering business now.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, yeah, just temporarily.",
        "KIRK: You guys any good?",
        "LORELAI: Not bad.",
        "KIRK: And how much would one have to pay for your culinary services?",
        "LORELAI: It depends, the type of food, number of people, kind of venue.",
        "KIRK: Simple food, two guests, my mother's living room.",
        "LORELAI: Really?",
        "KIRK: I have a visitor coming in from out of town and I thought it would be nice to serve her a catered meal.",
        "LORELAI: Her?",
        "KIRK: Actually, she was my brother's ex-girlfriend - Lulu.",
        "LORELAI: Good name.",
        "KIRK: I had sort of a crush on her for a while, and she's coming home to visit her mother, and she called me.",
        "LORELAI: Kirk, you have a date.",
        "KIRK: No, just an appointment to take Lulu to dinner.",
        "LORELAI: That's a date.",
        "KIRK: I don't have high hopes for it, if that's what you're thinking.",
        "LORELAI: Kirk, it's very sweet, but are you sure you want to have dinner in your living room?",
        "KIRK: Well, the breakfast nook doesn't seem festive enough.",
        "LORELAI: Right, but while you're having dinner in your living room, where will your mother be?",
        "KIRK: Probably in the living room.",
        "LORELAI: Is that what you really want? To have dinner with your mother watching?",
        "KIRK: I could ask her to face the wall.",
        "LORELAI: Or you could take Lulu out to a restaurant.",
        "KIRK: Which one?",
        "LORELAI: Well, what does she like?",
        "KIRK: I don't know. Should I call my brother and find out?",
        "LORELAI: I think if he knew, she'd probably still be with him.",
        "KIRK: I just really want it to be nice.",
        "LORELAI: Just take her someplace where you're comfortable. It doesn't have to be fancy. If you like it, she'll like it.",
        "KIRK: Okay.",
        "LORELAI: Just not one attached to a bowling alley.",
        "KIRK: That narrows it down a bit. I'll figure something out.",
        "LORELAI: Good. You'll see - it'll be great.",
        "KIRK: Do you think I could stop by tomorrow with some wardrobe choices for you to pick out?",
        "LORELAI: Kirk, you can dress yourself. Just look nice. You know, not too fancy. Clean. No jeans. Oh, maybe a sport coat. Eleven sound good?",
        "KIRK: Perfect.",
        "LORELAI: Okay.",

        "JANET: Yup. Phone.",
        "RORY: Thanks.",

        "PARIS: It's Jamie and we're fighting.",
        "RORY: Well, does he know you're fighting? 'Cause he's not hanging up.",
        "PARIS: Oh, he knows. Trust me, he knows.",
        "RORY: Okay. You're seriously not gonna answer that?",
        "PARIS: Nope.",

        "PARIS: Fine. [picks up the phone, then hangs it back up] There.",
        "RORY: Why are you and Jamie fighting?",
        "PARIS: Because he's wrong.",
        "RORY: Oh, okay.",
        "[the phone starts ringing again]",
        "PARIS: He won't listen to me. [picks up the phone] You won't listen to me! [hangs up] He's in love with the sound of his own voice. You'd think he was already president and I don't want to be Hillary. I don't want to wait for a hundred years while he does his thing so by the time I get my chance, I'm too old to enjoy it.",
        "RORY: Well, I don't think Hillary's too old to enjoy it.",
        "PARIS: Fine. Be on his side.",
        "RORY: I'm not on his side. I'm on her side.",

        "PARIS: Don't, Rory! I mean it!",
        "RORY: [answers the phone] Hello? Hi, Jamie. Yes, she is here.",
        "PARIS: No.",
        "RORY: Paris, you're acting stupid, okay? You love Jamie, so just get on the phone and work it out so that I can study, okay?",
        "PARIS: [takes the phone] What? No, I haven't thought about what you said. Because I'm very busy, Jamie, and contrary to your beliefs, I have better things to occupy my time with than thinking about you. Or what you said. Or what you meant or what you want or anything about you or concerning you. [Rory grabs the phone from her] Hey!",
        "RORY: Have him call you back on your cell phone. Then you can talk to him outside. It's nice outside. There are birds and trees.",
        "PARIS: My cell phone is dead.",
        "RORY: Then take mine.",
        "PARIS: What's your phone plan?",
        "RORY: Why?",
        "PARIS: 'Cause I'm not gonna borrow your phone and get slammed with a massive charge because your phone plan sucks.",
        "RORY: Paris!",
        "PARIS: [on phone] Jamie, I'm going to call you back on Rory's cell. Yes, I am. Yes, I am!",
        "RORY: Yes, she is!",
        "PARIS: Okay, bye. [hangs up]",
        "RORY: Here.",
        "PARIS: I'll be back.",

        "TANNA: Are you telling me to turn it off?",
        "RORY: I'm not telling -",
        "TANNA: You can, you know, because your grandma paid for the TV.",
        "RORY: I'm not telling you to turn the TV off.",
        "TANNA: Because you can.",
        "RORY: The TV belongs to all of us.",
        "TANNA: If it's a matter of volume, I could press my ear to the speaker and then I could turn it really low.",
        "RORY: Never mind.",
        "TANNA: The problem there is that the speakers for the TV are mounted up in the corner of the ceiling, but perhaps if I got a ladder.",
        "RORY: Never mind, Tanna.",
        "TANNA: Are you sure you don't want me to turn it off?",

        "[Sookie takes a pan of broccoli tarts out of the oven. She picks one up and holds it out toward Lorelai]",
        "SOOKIE: Try this one.",
        "LORELAI: Sookie, I love you, I love your cooking, but I swear if you make me eat one more bite of broccoli tart, I will beat you to death with it.",
        "SOOKIE: Your mother is the pickiest woman I have ever catered for. She has impeccable taste, the highest standards, and she can smell an inferior tart a mile away.",
        "LORELAI: Well, depending on how long it's been left out, we all can.",
        "SOOKIE: You know, she still hasn't called yet.",
        "LORELAI: She will.",
        "SOOKIE: But she was supposed to call about the details a couple of days ago.",
        "LORELAI: She will, Sookie.",
        "SOOKIE: But it's coming up and we still don't know if she wants a fish course or a cheese course.",
        "LORELAI: We'll make a fish-cheese combo course just to be sure.",
        "SOOKIE: Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: Why do I have to call her?",
        "SOOKIE: Because technically you're doing the organizing, and I've got batter hands. Oh, ask her about the foie gras. Is it too expected? 'Cause I can make it with a, you know, cherry compote. Okay. You know. . .you know what to say.",
        "LORELAI: [on phone] Hello, Mom.",
        "EMILY: Lorelai, hello. How nice to hear from you.",
        "LORELAI: How are you doing?",
        "EMILY: Well, I'm just fine, thank you for asking.",
        "LORELAI: Good, I'm glad to hear it.",
        "EMILY: And I'm glad to report it.",
        "LORELAI: Uh, so the reason I'm calling is we haven't heard from you yet, and we really need to nail down some of the details of the party.",
        "EMILY: \"We\" haven't heard from you yet?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, we - me and Sookie.",
        "EMILY: Ah, yes, the Independence Catering Company.",
        "LORELAI: Uh huh. So, anyhow -",
        "EMILY: You know, a few years ago, there was a company called Independent Catering.

Something to think about until next week, when we will burst more of your illusions. . .which brings me to a bit of bad news. There was an error in the syllabus you received. The dates were wrong, which means that all of your reading has been pushed up one week. I apologize for this cruel little life experience, but what can I do?
