        "[Lorelai, Richard and Emily are sitting in the living room]",
        "LORELAI: Mom, I swear, it was Aunt Maureen.",
        "EMILY: Aunt Maureen would never hike up her skirt in public.",
        "LORELAI: She would after half a gallon of eggnog.",
        "EMILY: Richard, who was the one who got drunk at our Christmas party and hiked up her skirt in front of the Town and Country photographer?",
        "RICHARD: I'm sorry, did you say something?",
        "LORELAI: I don't know about you, Mom, but I've never felt so fascinating in my entire life.",
        "[Rory walks in]",
        "RORY: I'm so sorry I'm late. Hi Grandma, Hi Grandma.",
        "RICHARD: Hello Rory.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, now he closes the paper.",
        "RORY: Hey, Mom, I stopped by the bookstore on the way here.",
        "LORELAI: You got them?",
        "RORY: I got them!",
        "EMILY: Got what?",
        "LORELAI: Rory and I are starting to plan our Europe trip.",
        "RORY: The day after graduation, we are gone.",
        "RICHARD: Well, that sounds very exciting.",
        "EMILY: Lorelai, what are these?",
        "LORELAI: Those are guidebooks.",
        "EMILY: \"Europe Through the Backdoor.\" \"The Rough Guide to Europe.\" What kind of guidebooks are these?",
        "LORELAI: The cheap kind.",
        "RORY: They have all the good information about backpacking and staying in hostels.",
        "EMILY: Backpacking and staying in hostels?",
        "RICHARD: Who's backpacking and staying in hostels?",
        "LORELAI: We are.",
        "[Emily and Richard laugh]",
        "EMILY: No, you're not.",
        "RICHARD: What a ridiculous thought.",
        "RORY: We are. We're going to backpack around Europe.",
        "EMILY: Yes, I know, it's fun to tease your grandmother, dear. They're going to backpack across Europe, Richard.",
        "RICHARD: I heard, sounds delightful. Perhaps we should join them.",
        "EMILY: That sounds wonderful. Tomorrow I'll go out and buy some cutoffs.",
        "LORELAI: Guys, we're not kidding.",
        "EMILY: You're telling me you're seriously going to traipse across Europe with your possessions strapped to your back and sleep in a room with thirty other people?",
        "LORELAI: Yes.",
        "RICHARD: No.",
        "RORY: Grandpa.",
        "RICHARD: It's not safe. I forbid it. Call our travel agent.",
        "RORY: But we want to be spontaneous. Jump a train to Paris, head off to Spain.",
        "LORELAI: Oh no, it's raining in Spain. But since the rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain. . .",
        "RORY: Looks like Italy for us!",
        "LORELAI: Mamma mia!",
        "RICHARD: You can still travel around aimlessly and stay in a decent hotel.",
        "LORELAI: We wanna do it cheap.",
        "EMILY: We'll pay.",
        "LORELAI: No.",
        "RORY: Grandma, it's going to be fun, really.",
        "LORELAI: Kids do this all the time.",
        "EMILY: Yes, but you're not a kid, you're a grown woman. What are people going to think when they see a grown woman bunking down with a bunch of twenty-year-olds?",
        "LORELAI: Well, if the twenty-year-olds are cute, they'll probably think, \"Lucky!\"",
        "RORY: Grandma, don't be upset. It really is going to be great.",
        "EMILY: [reads from book] What's so traumatic about a night without a bed anyway? My survey shows those who have had the opportunity to be a refugee for a night have their perspectives broaden and actually enjoy the experience.\" Richard, this book is encouraging them to sleep in a park like a squirrel.",
        "LORELAI: It's okay, Mom.",
        "EMILY: My first trip to Europe, I went to Paris and stayed at the Ritz.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I tell you what, if it'll make you happy, we'll go to Paris and eat out of their dumpster.",

        "DEAN: Tom, I brought over the nails you asked for.",
        "TOM: Good. Get the guy's lunch orders, will ya?",
        "DEAN: Already done.",
        "TOM: You're a good kid, Dean. You hardly bug me at all.",
        "DEAN: High praise.",
        "TOM: Yeah, yeah, go, get the food. And don't forget the pickles.",
        "DEAN: I wouldn't dare.",
        "TOM: Oh, what do I gotta say to get this crap inside where it belongs? You got a language I'm not privy to? \u0091Cause I'm a fast learner.",
        "MISS PATTY: Dean-o, Dean-o, Dean-o. If you grow any taller, I'm gonna have to get myself some mountain climbing equipment.",
        "DEAN: You're getting dangerous to even walk near, you know that, Patty.",
        "MISS PATTY: I've been told.",
        "DEAN: You looking for Mr. Doose?",
        "MISS PATTY: Oh, precious, no. I'm just looking.",

        "LUKE: Yes.",
        "JESS: So a special place.",
        "LUKE: Will you stop saying that word, please? And yes.",
        "JESS: Find anything good?",
        "LUKE: Every single description in here talks about tablecloths and dish design, nothing about the food.",
        "JESS: You are really going through an awful lot for this lawyer.",
        "LUKE: She's not a lawyer. I mean, yes, she's a lawyer, but she's also a lady, and a very nice lady who probably expects good food with her fancy plates and sparse yet elegant d\u00e9cor.",
        "JESS: You're pathetic when you're in love.",
        "LUKE: I'm not in love, I'm dating. This is what you do when you're dating.",
        "JESS: It's not what I do when I'm dating.",
        "LUKE: Well, Rory's a lucky girl. Work. I'm going upstairs.",
        "JESS: Fine, but if a horse-drawn carriage shows up here, my throwing up will be eternal.",

        "JESS: What do you want?",
        "DEAN: Six burgers, three with cheese -- two cheddar, one Swiss. Two plain, one with chili, cheese and onions on the side. Your memory's that good?",
        "JESS: You're screwing with me.",

        "JESS: For all of Connecticut?",
        "DEAN: For the construction crew next door.",
        "JESS: Oh, you're Taylor's errand boy now.",

        "JESS: Say that a little closer.",
        "DEAN: I thought you had a girlfriend.",
        "JESS: Give me your order and get out.",
        "DEAN: Service with a smile. Uh, six burgers, three cheese -- two cheddar, one Swiss. Two plain burgers, one chili burger with cheese and onions on the side. Three ham on ryes - one mayo, one mustard, one combo. A combo means mustard and \u0096",
        "JESS: I know what a combo means.",
        "DEAN: Sorry, guess that confused look is just how your face is.",
        "JESS: Do you wanna talk about this outside?",
        "DEAN: Just as soon as I'm finished. Uh, four hot dogs. Two egg salads on white. One chicken salad on wheat. A chef's salad with ranch. Five fries. Five onion rings. Two chips. Extra pickles.",
        "JESS: On what?",
        "DEAN: Excuse me?",
        "JESS: What are the extra pickles on?",
        "DEAN: On the side.",
        "JESS: On the side of what? On the side of the burgers, on the side of the sandwiches, or on the side of the road where the ditch I'm gonna dump your body into is?",
        "DEAN: Just make sure there's enough for everyone.",
        "JESS: Fine.",
        "DEAN: Aren't you gonna read it back?",
        "JESS: Nope.",
        "DEAN: Okay, but these men were hired by Taylor, which means if they aren't satisfied with their orders, they will send them back. And they will continue to send them back until they are happy, which means you could be making this order until you die.",
        "JESS: Six burgers, three with cheese \u0096 two cheddar, one Swiss.",
        "DEAN: Slower, please. I'm checking them off as we go.",

        "MICHEL: No.",
        "LORELAI: He's changing his mind about the theme for his retirement party again.",
        "MICHEL: No!",
        "LORELAI: We have to call the florist.",
        "MICHEL: But this is the fourth theme he's picked. He had the fishing one, and the Kentucky Derby with the chocolate horsies, and the Tibet with the Richard Gere pictures everywhere.",
        "LORELAI: I know.",
        "MICHEL: And he promised that the golf would be the last one.",
        "LORELAI: Well, he decided that golf was dull and he doesn't want to be remembered as dull.",
        "MICHEL: Would he like to be remembered as limping, because I can be a fabulous help with that.",
        "[They walk to the dining room, where workers are decorating the room in a golf theme]",
        "LORELAI: Hey, guys. . .",
        "[Everyone groans]",
        "LORELAI: I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.",
        "MICHEL: Here's an idea \u0096 it's a retirement party, yes? Okay. So what happens after you retire? You die.",
        "LORELAI: He changed his mind.",
        "LANE: Again?",
        "MICHEL: So, why don't we dig a big hole, throw him in, hand everybody a shovel, they take turns covering him up. We go inside, have dinner, the wife gets used to eating alone. . .",
        "LORELAI: We are not going to bury him alive.",
        "MICHEL: Well, fine then. What is the new theme?",
        "LORELAI: He is calling me back at four.",
        "RORY: I got the flags and. . .he changed his mind again.",
        "LANE: He's worse than my mother at the Glory of Easter T-shirt stand.",
        "LORELAI: You kept the receipt, I hope.",
        "RORY: Yup.",
        "LORELAI: Good God, this party is gonna be the death of me.",
        "MICHEL: Or someone.",
        "LORELAI: Go call the florist.",
        "RORY: You're stressed.",
        "LORELAI: You're observant.",
        "RORY: Well, I was going to save this for later, but you look like you need it now.",
        "LORELAI: What's that?",
        "RORY: I have been cordially invited to Sherry Tinsdale's C-section.",
        "LORELAI: No way!",
        "RORY: [reads from invitation] Friday, February seventh, six o'clock p.m. Join the girls for a toast, a hug, a wave to the mommy as they wheel her off, dinner at Sushi Sushi, and then back to the hospital for a formal viewing of brand-new baby Georgia. RSVP at your earliest convenience. P.S. -- gifts are not necessary, but always appreciated.",
        "LORELAI: I don't even know where to start.",
        "RORY: I knew you would like it.",
        "LORELAI: You have to RSVP to a C-section.",
        "RORY: And bring a gift.",
        "LORELAI: I wonder if Laura Mercier makes Demerol.",
        "RORY: You wanna keep it?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, yes, please.",
        "RORY: But don't lose it. I need the phone number.",
        "LORELAI: So, are you going?",
        "RORY: Well, I don't know. I mean, I know it's weird, but I kind of wanna see Georgia. She's sort of my sister.",
        "LORELAI: She's more than sort of your sister.",
        "RORY: I just think it would be cool to meet her the night that she's born. It's a good story to talk about.",
        "LORELAI: You should go.",
        "RORY: I should, shouldn't I?",
        "LORELAI: And you should take pictures and wear a hidden microphone \u0091cause I wanna hear everything.",
        "RORY: I'll see what I can do.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, shoot.",
        "[Lorelai walks to the kitchen, where Sookie is frosting a golf ball cake]",

        "LORELAI: Just hold your breath this one actually takes.",
        "RORY: And how is Sookie supposed to plan a Beanie Baby menu?",
        "LORELAI: Lots of beans.",
        "RORY: I think this is ridiculous.",
        "LORELAI: Angel face, you need to learn that there are going to be times in your life when you have to do ridiculous things for money. If you're Adrian Zmed, that includes everything that ever happens in your whole career. [sees a box on the porch] Oh Rory, come on. Did you order from Amazon again? 'Cause we're going to get your books their own house.",
        "RORY: I didn't, I swear.",
        "LORELAI: It's from my mother.",
        "RORY: What is it?",
        "LORELAI: It's heavy. Must be her hopes and dreams for me.",
        "RORY: I thought she discarded those years ago.",
        "[they walk into the house]",
        "LORELAI: Just drop the Beanies by the door. [reads note attached to the box] \"Girls, here are some travel books I stumbled across in your father's study. I thought they could help in the planning of your European adventure.\" She's insane.",
        "RORY: We have travel books.",
        "LORELAI: No, sweetie, these aren't our kind of travel books. These are Paris and Nicky Hilton's kind of travel books.",
        "RORY: [pulls some books out of the box] \"Selected Hotels of Europe,\" \"Hotels, Restaurants and Inns of Great Britain and Ireland, 1986\", \"Myra Waldo's Travel and Motoring Guide to Europe, '78.\"",
        "LORELAI: Wow, these will be an enormous help in planning our trip. Hey, you wanna go see the Berlin Wall?",
        "RORY: Sounds great.",
        "LORELAI: My God, I remember these books. I think the only person in my house who ever read them was me.",
        "RORY: This hotel is five hundred dollars a night.",
        "LORELAI: Five hundred dollars a night twenty years ago.",
        "RORY: What could a hotel possibly have that would make it five hundred dollars a night?",
        "LORELAI: An English menu?",

        "CHRISTOPHER: So, she likes me.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, that's right. Mom, it's me, Lorelai, I'm home! I'm home and I'm taking my sweater off. I'm taking my sweater off and dropping it on the floor. I'm dropping it on the floor and walking away from it. I'm walking away from it and leaving it on the floor, and in two years I'm gonna register Democrat. Looks like no Emily.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Where's Sofia?",
        "LORELAI: Fired.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Already.",
        "LORELAI: She touched the Baccarat unicorn.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: My God, is she insane?",
        "LORELAI: Apparently so.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Okay, so, to recap, there's no Emily and there's no Sofia.",
        "LORELAI: And there's no supervision whatsoever. What will we do?",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Let's celebrate.",
        "LORELAI: Celebrate what?",

        "LORELAI: Hear, hear.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Okay.",
        "LORELAI: And put a cherry in it. It looks like the Gilmores are planning a trip again.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Where to this time?",
        "LORELAI: Someplace fabulous where they'll stay at a fancy hotel with a lot of other rich Americans so they won't have to talk to anyone who actually lives in that country.",

        "LORELAI: Are you serious?",
        "CHRISTOPHER: I'm taking a year and I'm going to Europe. I'm gonna backpack, train it, sleep on a bench, see the world.",
        "LORELAI: And you've told Straub and Francine about your big plans, I'm sure.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Ah, it doesn't matter.",

        "CHRISTOPHER: Yup.",
        "LORELAI: I'm sleeping on a bench? Okay, how does that picture look to you, \u0091cause to me it looks like a big no.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Fine, you we get a room for, and then I'll just sleep on the bench outside.",
        "LORELAI: Much better arrangement.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: So you'll go?",
        "LORELAI: Christopher, you're supposed to go to college. I'm supposed to go to college. Then you're supposed to join your dad's firm where you'll get a corner office and big stick to shove up your butt.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Change of plans.",
        "LORELAI: You can't just change the plans. The plans came over on the Mayflower.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Come on, Lor. Let's get out of here, let's get away from this place. Let's take Myra and just bolt. Leave a note on the dining room table. \"Dear Richard and Emily, I don't belong here, I'm going somewhere else, I'll call you when I get there. Love, Lorelai.' How does that sound?",
        "LORELAI: Well, the word \"whoopee\" comes to mind.",
