        "OPEN AT STARS HOLLOW TOWN CENTER",
        "[Miss Patty is trying to get a group of children to dance around a Maypole. Kirk watches from the side of the gazebo.]",
        "MISS PATTY: No, no, boys. You go clockwise! Clockwise! Can't you tell time?",
        "CHRISSY: The other way, boys! They're not getting it, Miss Patty.",
        "MISS PATTY: Well, the wedding's tomorrow. We gotta get it.",
        "CHRISSY: It's the Banyan boys. They won't do what I tell them.",
        "KIRK: Nice maypole, Patty! Really organized!",
        "MISS PATTY: Oh, shut up, Kirk!",
        "LORELAI: Tough day, Patty?",
        "MISS PATTY: I've worked with Joan Crawford. This is worse.",
        "KIRK: I don't call that a \"maypole.\" I'd call that a \"maybe-not pole.\"",
        "LORELAI: What's with him?",
        "MISS PATTY: He's mad because I made Chrissy my dance captain over him.",
        "LORELAI: Kirk has forty-three jobs.",
        "MISS PATTY: Would you go talk to him, please? I got my hands full here.",
        "LORELAI: The Banyan boys?",
        "MISS PATTY: Oh! Lucifer tired of them in hell and dumped them here.",
        "LORELAI: I'll talk to Kirk.",
        "MISS PATTY: Thank you. All right, Chrissy, let's give it another go!",
        "LORELAI: Hey, Kirk, maybe you want to ease up on Patty a little.",
        "KIRK: But the maypole is an expertise of mine. I re-enacted the dwarf's maypole choreography from \"The Safety Dance\" video, my junior-high talent show. Chicks were falling at my feet. I'm less than impressed, Patty!",
        "LORELAI: Take a break, please. I've seen Miss Patty get violent. It's not pretty. Remember that time?",
        "KIRK: That's when she beat me up.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah. Let's not repeat that.",
        "KIRK: Okay.",
        "[Jess sits on a nearby bench. He and Lorelai glance at each other as she passes. He looks like he's reading Punk Planet, but inside the magazine he's hiding You're Not Alone, one of the self-help books Luke gave him.]",
        "CUT TO DRAGONFLY INN KITCHEN",
        "JACKSON: They're the best I've got.",
        "SOOKIE: That's sad for you and the whole vegetable industry.",
        "JACKSON: They're the best in the state. I stand by them.",
        "SOOKIE: They're puny. They're tasteless.",
        "JACKSON: Puny? These are not puny.",
        "SOOKIE: If they're small enough to shove up our son's nose, they're too small!",
        "JACKSON: No way could you shove one of these up Davey's nose.",
        "SOOKIE: Bet you five bucks.",
        "JACKSON: Get him in here!",
        "LORELAI: [entering] Hey, guys. You probably shouldn't shove a radish up your son's nose. Just thinking out loud.",
        "SOOKIE: All right, I'll take these if it's all you've got.",
        "JACKSON: Well, don't do me any favors. [leaves]",
        "LORELAI: You two are back big-time.",
        "SOOKIE: That actually felt good. [Chuckles] Like getting a Jack LaLanne workout.",
        "LORELAI: Dead or alive?",
        "SOOKIE: Jack LaLanne? Dead. No -- alive. [Lorelai's phone rings] Oh, now that's gonna bug me.",
        "LORELAI: Hello?",
        "RORY: [walking through Yale campus] There is so much joy around me, I'm gonna hurl.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, what's wrong?",
        "RORY: You should see all the boisterous high-fiving going on all around me. It's sad. It's just really sad. Hey, do you mind, buddy?",
        "LORELAI: Kids are in party mode, huh?",
        "RORY: The kids are clicking their heels like there's no tomorrow. And there is no tomorrow for those who do not have a final on Saturday morning, such as me. I'm pathetic. I should stand between two of them and have them high-five my head from opposite sides and put me out of my misery.",
        "LORELAI: Just one more final to go, then you'll be free.",
        "RORY: Ahh, two more boisterous bozos just rubbing my face in it.",
        "LORELAI: You know, I do have one thing to run by you. Do you have the brain power?",
        "RORY: I think I can swing it.",
        "LORELAI: It involves the \"J\" word.",
        "RORY: Oh, not more about Jesus. I'm sick of him and Mel Gibson.",
        "LORELAI: Jess.",
        "RORY: Oh, what about him?",
        "LORELAI: He's in town for that wedding and I never know where we stand on the Jessometer. I've been seeing him. I was just wondering if you want me to tell you when I do.",
        "RORY: Sure.",
        "LORELAI: Really?",
        "RORY: Why not?",
        "LORELAI: Okay. It's just always so weird -- this \"J\"-word topic of ours.",
        "RORY: You don't have to refer to him as \"the 'J' word.\" Call him \"Jess,\" and feel free to tell me when you see him.",
        "LORELAI: Okay.",
        "RORY: I mean, if you see him eight times in one day, you don't need to call me eight different times to tell me. That's clearly overdose.",
        "LORELAI: Sure.",
        "RORY: Maybe, like, you could limit the reports to just significant sightings. If you see him a hundred yards away, disappearing around a corner, I really don't need to know that. If he comes up to you and spits in your face, report that.",
        "LORELAI: Permission to spit back?",
        "RORY: You know what I'm saying.",
        "LORELAI: I know what you're saying. Hey, you know what I should do? Run up, tell him I love him, then run away really fast -- a taste of his own medicine.",
        "RORY: Don't do that! Don't do anything out of the ordinary.",
        "LORELAI: I won't. Honey, I'm kidding. [Gasps]",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: There's a horse in the dining room.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: Cletus is in the dining room.",
        "RORY: Why?",
        "LORELAI: He heard about the terrific continental breakfast? I don't know. I gotta go look into this.",
        "RORY: Okay. Bye.",
        "LORELAI: Cletus, honey!",
        "MICHEL: Lorelai, I need your signature on this, please.",
        "LORELAI: Michel.",
        "MICHEL: Yes?",
        "LORELAI: Do you see the big-nostriled thing next to me here?",
        "MICHEL: The horse?",
        "LORELAI: Uh-huh, the horse.",
        "MICHEL: It's been here for twenty minutes.",
        "LORELAI: Oh. What were you doing about it?",
        "MICHEL: Eh, nothing.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, no, nothing?",
        "MICHEL: It's a giant, smelly horse. I figured someone was already taking care of it.",
        "LORELAI: Oh.",
        "SOOKIE: He's alive!",
        "LORELAI: Who?",
        "SOOKIE: Jack LaLanne. I just googled him. Hi, Cletus.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, so you already saw the horse?",
        "SOOKIE: Yeah. Sure, he's been here, what, twenty, thirty minutes?",
        "MICHEL: About twenty-five.",
        "LORELAI: New Dragonfly Inn rule -- everyone listening? Okay, if you see a horse in the inn or any other large quadruped or biped or anything that's not -- what's the word -- human, figure no one's doing anything about it and do something.",
        "MICHEL: Oh, fine with me.",
        "SOOKIE: Yeah, same here.",
        "MICHEL: If we had the rule before, I would have done something.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. Great. Thanks. Bye. [to Cletus] Come on, troublemaker.",
        "CUT TO YALE DORM",
        "RORY: Hittin' the road, Glenn?",
        "GLENN: Yep, and I got a hot date tonight.",
        "RORY: Who's the lucky girl?",
        "GLENN: I'm getting back together with my girl from back home. Want to see her picture?",
        "RORY: Sure. Glenn, this girl is, like, twelve years old.",
        "GLENN: It's her when she was little. Don't make this into something dirty! She drives and everything.",
        "RORY: Have a good summer, Glenn.",
        "TANA: Oh, Rory, perfect timing. I want you to meet somebody. This is my boyfriend, Chester Fleet.",
        "RORY: Oh, hi, Chester. I've heard a lot about you.",
        "CHESTER: You can't believe everything you hear.",
        "TANA: Oh, it's kind of a weird day to meet him because he lost a bet with me. And that means that for the entire day, he can only talk in clich\u00e9s. It's so much fun.",
        "RORY: Sounds it.",
        "CHESTER: It's always fun till someone gets hurt.",
        "JANET: Hey, I'm leaving, guys. Rory, you get yourself a funky monkey?",
        "RORY: What?",
        "JANET: Everyone poured all the alcohol they had left into a bowl and that's what's in the cup. Tastes gross, but does the trick.",
        "TANA: I stashed one in the fridge for you. It was poured for me, but I'm not having one.",
        "CHESTER: Lips that touch wine shall never touch mine.",
        "TANA: So much fun!",
        "JANET: Well, I guess this is goodbye. See you, Rory. Have a good one.",
        "RORY: Bye, Janet.",
        "PARIS: Janet, wait, wait! [runs into the room and hugs Janet] I hate that our little clique is breaking up. It's so the end of something.",
        "JANET: You off your meds, Paris?",
        "PARIS: You never get emotional at goodbyes?",
        "JANET: With people I like. See you.",
        "PARIS: Keep in touch.",
        "TANA: So I made a collage of photos of people in the building, and I'm having everyone sign. Will you two do me the honor?",
        "RORY: Sure.",
        "PARIS: I'll honor you.",
        "TANA: Isn't it a great keepsake? There's Janet with her boyfriend and Lana with hers. That's Mark and Stacy -- they're inseparable. And, oh, there's one of you, Rory.",
        "RORY: That's me.",
        "TANA: And, um, Janet and her boyfriend again, and me with Chester.",
        "CHESTER: You're the apple of my eye.",
        "PARIS: That's getting annoying there, Chester.",
        "TANA: And, uh, there you are again, Rory, with...oh, that's a lamppost. Oh, here's a bunch of couples from Valentine's Day. You're not in that one. And here you are with all the cafeteria ladies. I can make you a copy of that, if you'd like.",
        "RORY: That's okay.",
        "PARIS: Rory, you've had quite the dry spell this year.",
        "RORY: I have not had a dry spell.",
        "PARIS: There's not one picture of you with a guy.",
        "TANA: Oh, no. No. There's one. See? That's Rory with the statue of Eli Yale.",
        "PARIS: People are gonna talk.",
        "RORY: I don't care what people say. Are people talking?",
        "PARIS: Not that I've heard. You just don't get out enough.",
        "CHESTER: All work and no play makes Jack...",
        "RORY: Say goodbye before you leave?",
        "TANA: Will do.",
        "[Rory and Paris go into their room.]",
        "RORY: Since when are you someone who defines a girl by whether or not she's with a guy? I mean, you embarrassed me in front of Tana and Chester.",
        "PARIS: Please. They were singing the lumberjack song at the top of their lungs. They're embarrassment-proof. [hands Rory a piece of paper] Here.",
        "RORY: What's this? Leonard Fleming?",
        "PARIS: Asher's son. He's a terrific guy -- good looking, runs a mutual fund, newly divorced, and on the hunt.",
        "RORY: I don't think so.",
        "PARIS: The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. He is one hot apple, juicy to the core.",
        "RORY: I got it. Nice, hot apple.",
        "PARIS: I just want you to be happy.",
        "RORY: Please, don't feel sorry for me. I'm fine.",
        "PARIS: I don't want you to have a long, dry summer.",
        "RORY: Please stop talking about my love life.",
        "PARIS: Fine. Wish me a merry trip to jolly old England.",
        "RORY: Have a merry trip.",
        "PARIS: And hey, if you call Leonard and one of his kids answers, hang up. They still think Mommy's coming back.",
        "CUT TO KIM'S ANTIQUES",
        "LORELAI: Oh, hey, Mrs. Kim.",
        "MRS. KIM: Hello, Lorelai. What can I do for you?",
        "LORELAI: Well, do you still have the big door knockers -- metal with the chipped red paint? [Mrs. Kim picks up a door knocker.] You're a magician. Do you know that? Oh, it's great. Isn't it big?",
        "MRS. KIM: And good price, seeing as how it may have belonged to James Madison. It was commonly known that James Madison liked big knockers.",
        "LORELAI: [laughing] I bet a lot of the founding fathers liked big knockers. I'm sorry for laughing. I'd explain if I could.",
        "MRS. KIM: It's a double entendre. I've been in this country 20 years. I get things.",
        "LORELAI: I never doubted.",
        "MRS. KIM: It's ninety dollars.",
        "LORELAI: I'll take it.",
        "MRS. KIM: Here.",
        "LORELAI: What's this?",
        "MRS. KIM: Mail for Lane. I know you go to Luke's, where she works. If you could pass this on to her, I would appreciate it.",
        "LORELAI: Mrs. Kim, hasn't this gone on long enough?",
        "MRS. KIM: Not for you to say.",
        "LORELAI: She's your only child. I know you miss her. She misses you. Call her. See her. Don't avoid her.",
        "MRS. KIM: This is between me and my daughter.",
        "LORELAI: Well, as your mailman, I hereby resign.",
        "MRS. KIM: Fine. It comes to $140.",
        "LORELAI: You said ninety.",
        "MRS. KIM: Wrapping charge.",
        "CUT TO LUKE'S DINER",
        "[Liz and her friends sit at one of the tables laughing while Luke works on a plate of turkey legs at the counter.]",
        "CARRIE: And it's not just guys -- girls are not supposed to be monogamous, either. We're homo sapiens, not rocks.",
        "LIZ: That'so unromantic.",
        "WOMAN 1: You can say that. You got lucky.",
        "WOMAN 2: Yeah, T.J. Is yum, yum.",
        "LIZ: I did get lucky, didn't I?",
        "CARRIE: We're animals, and animals in the wild don't mate for life, except, like, tigers, but they're retarded.",
        "LUKE: Hey, Liz.",
        "CARRIE: Men are good for two things. Make that one, and the one thing they're not that good at.",
        "LUKE: Excuse me, sorry to break up the festivities, but do you have any idea if I'm doing this right?",
        "CARRIE: Most guys don't know if they're doing it right.",
        "LIZ: Uh, not my expertise, bro, but they smell good, if that helps.",
        "LUKE: Well, there should have been an instruction book of some kind.",
        "LIZ: I'm so sorry this got dumped on you, but the turkey leg guy knew that going into that bar violated his parole. You can't reason with him.",
        "LUKE: Is this how turkey legs are supposed to look?",
        "CARRIE: I don't know. Take off your pants and let us see.",
        "LUKE: Hey, weren't you guys going to a spa or something?",
        "LIZ: Yeah, we're going, right?",
        "WOMAN 2: In a minute.",
        "JESS: [coming into the room and speaking to Luke] I need to get some batteries. I'll be back.",
        "LIZ: Jess! Jess! Come over here and meet my oldest friends.",
        "LUKE: Watch the one on the left.",
        "JESS: Thanks.",
        "LIZ: Girls, this is Jess.",
        "CARRIE: Hello, handsome.",
        "WOMAN 1 & 2: Hi.",
        "JESS: Hi.",
        "LIZ: He's gonna walk me down the aisle. Is that cool or what?",
        "JESS: It's no big deal.",
        "LIZ: It's a very big deal.",
        "[A man dressed in a delivery uniform opens the diner door.]",
        "LUKE: Can I help you?",
        "MAN: Got a package here.",
        "[Carrie and other women sit up straighter.]",
        "LUKE: From who? I'm not expecting anything.",
        "MAN: It's a very important package.",
        "LUKE: But there's no address on it.",
        "JESS: Have fun.",
        "LUKE: Have fun with what?",
        "MAN: This package is for Liz Danes.",
        "LIZ: Oh, that -- that's me.",
        "MAN: Do you accept delivery?",
        "LIZ: I -- I guess.",
        "[The man starts to strip as the women cheer.]",
        "CARRIE: Shake it, doll, shake it.",
        "LUKE: No, don't shake it in here.",
        "WOMAN 1: Luke, we need change!",
        "WOMAN 2: Turn these twenties into ones!",
        "LIZ: I don't believe this, you rats!",

        "CUT TO DOOSE'S MARKET",
        "[Kirk is working the cash register. Jess gets in line behind Dean.]",
        "KIRK: Nail polish remover -- $1.40. Ladies Speed Stick -- $2.60. Good choice on that one. Keeps you dry all day and into the night. Jasmine body lotion -- nice price on that. Might want to get a couple.",
        "DEAN: [to Jess] It's for my wife.",
        "KIRK: And, with your emery boards, it comes to $19.67.",
        "DEAN: Keep the change.",

        "EMILY: I'm so sorry you have a final tomorrow. I thought you'd be free as a bird tonight.",
        "RORY: Them's the breaks.",
        "EMILY: You could have stayed at school and studied if you had to. I hope you know that.",
        "LORELAI: You're playing different music.",
        "EMILY: Hmm?",
        "LORELAI: The music -- it's different. Some chick is singing.",
        "EMILY: It's \"Blossom Deary.\" You don't like it?",
        "LORELAI: No, I like it fine. You've just never played it. You and Dad always play classical music.",
        "EMILY: We just thought we'd try something new tonight.",
        "LORELAI: We?",
        "EMILY: He's out of town, but you know what I mean. We talked about changing the music. So when will you be done with your final tomorrow?",
        "RORY: Around noon, depending on how fast I write.",
        "EMILY: Any friends left behind to keep you company -- girlfriends, boyfriends?",
        "RORY: Well, my roommates are all gone, and I'd say 95% of the class has vamoosed.",
        "EMILY: And you don't have a boyfriend?",
        "RORY: Not really.",
        "LORELAI: Why, do you? [on Emily's look] I'm making a joke.",
        "EMILY: I was just wondering. We haven't talked about your love life in a while. I get to ask sometimes, don't I?",
        "RORY: Um, sure.",
        "LORELAI: Where'd you say Dad was?",
        "RORY: [enunciating] In Philadelphia.",
        "LORELAI: Thanks, Mom. Philadelphia, huh? Funny, you didn't mention that to me when we talked earlier. You just said he wouldn't be here.",
        "EMILY: Well, what do you want, Lorelai? For his secretary to fax you his schedule?",
        "LORELAI: No, I just want to be kept informed.",
        "EMILY: Well, a lot of his schedule these days has to do with Floyd AKA your ex-boyfriend's father. I didn't know how much detail you wanted to hear.",
        "LORELAI: I hear you. Blossom hears you. We're good.",
        "EMILY: So you'll be a free girl around noon?",
        "RORY: Around then.",
        "EMILY: I just wanted to know because I to be thinking about you right at that moment when the weight is lifting off your shoulders.",
        "RORY: I'll be looking forward to it.",
        "EMILY: I'll be right back. I'm going to see if Kiki put the raspberry souffl\u00e9s in.",
        "LORELAI: Dad hates raspberries.",
        "EMILY: No, he doesn't.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, sorry, thought he did. Sorry.",
        "[Emily leaves.]",
        "RORY: What is going on here?",
        "LORELAI: I'm trying to get her to fess up to the separation.",
        "RORY: No, me! Am I cloaked in loneliness or something? Everybody has been pestering me about my love life this week.",
        "LORELAI: That was not about you. It was about evading my questions. It's a classic Sun Tzu \"Art of War\" maneuver. If you're being attacked from the east, attack whoever's to your west, and you were the west. I never read the book. It's full of crap like that.",
        "RORY: Well, stop attacking her so she'll stop attacking me.",
        "LORELAI: Well, you butted into my line of inquiry with your, \"He's in Philadelphia\" stuff. She was about ready to crack.",
        "RORY: She was not ready to crack. She was ready to say, \"He's in Philadelphia.\"",
        "LORELAI: Did he sound like he was in Philadelphia when he called?",
        "RORY: You mean, did I hear guys in the background saying, \"Get your Philly cheesesteak here?\"",
        "LORELAI: Why aren't you seeing anybody, by the way?",
        "RORY: I'm gonna throw a roll at you.",
