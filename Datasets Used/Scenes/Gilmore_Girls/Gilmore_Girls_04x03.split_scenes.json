        "OPEN AT YALE DORM",
        "[There's a knock on the door of Rory's suite. Rory opens it and Lorelai is there, holding a box and a rolled-up rug]",
        "LORELAI: Hey, you know what's great about you going off to college?",
        "RORY: My newfound independence?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, no. My new batch of youth-oriented catalogs. For example, where on Earth could I put this fabulous purple flowered rug? It's so young and cool but doesn't really go with my room, so. . .",
        "RORY: My room.",
        "LORELAI: Ooh! The matching beanbag chair arrives next week.",
        "RORY: I love it when you miss me.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, it's not that I miss you. It's just since you've been gone, I finally realized how the living room stayed so clean.",
        "RORY: Mmhmm. What do you think?",
        "LORELAI: It works.",
        "RORY: Thank you.",
        "LORELAI: You're welcome. So, Sookie sent marshmallow cookies, Luke sent muffins, and I got you a copy of the Stars Hollow Gazette.",
        "RORY: You don't have to bring that to me anymore. I subscribed.",
        "LORELAI: You subscribed to the Stars Hollow Gazette? The editor of the Stars Hollow Gazette does not subscribe to the Stars Hollow Gazette.",
        "RORY: I didn't want to get cut off from the town.",
        "LORELAI: That's very sweet of you. Hey, you wanna grab some coffee before I head back?",
        "RORY: Can't.",
        "LORELAI: Why?",
        "RORY: It's shopping week.",
        "LORELAI: Isn't it always?",
        "RORY: The first week of school is called shopping week. You get to try out as many classes as you want before you pick the ones you want to stick with for the semester. I picked over fifty classes I'm gonna try out, plus another ten I'm gonna squeeze in if I have the time. They all sound completely amazing. I stayed up all night reading the class subscriptions over and over.",
        "LORELAI: You do know that if you weren't so pretty, you would've gotten the crap kicked out of you every day of your life.",
        "RORY: Walk me out?",
        "LORELAI: Because you need the protection. Hey, what time's your first class?",
        "RORY: Oh, you know, soon.",
        "LORELAI: Uh oh.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: You're not gonna rush to your first class and get there like an hour early, are you?",
        "RORY: No.",
        "LORELAI: You are.",
        "RORY: I am not.",
        "LORELAI: When you started elementary school, you told me the teacher wanted to meet all the parents at 6:30, and when we got there, the school wasn't open yet.",
        "RORY: I did that once.",
        "LORELAI: No, you got away with it once. You tried it every year.",
        "RORY: I'm not gonna be early.",
        "LORELAI: You know, if you took all the time you wasted being early for things. . . [she looks around the room]",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: My mother was here.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: My mother - she was here. I can feel it.",
        "RORY: Grandma hasn't been here.",
        "LORELAI: Smell that?",
        "RORY: Smell what?",
        "LORELAI: The room - it smells like guilt and Chanel No. 5.",
        "RORY: Mom, I'm telling you, you're wrong.",
        "LORELAI: You put the coffee table like that?",
        "RORY: No.",
        "LORELAI: Ha!",
        "RORY: I have three other roommates. One of them probably did it.",
        "LORELAI: Three roommates?",
        "RORY: Yup.",
        "LORELAI: When'd the other one come?",
        "RORY: Last night. Her name's Janet.",
        "LORELAI: What's she like?",
        "RORY: She jogs.",
        "LORELAI: Enough said.",
        "RORY: Come on, let's go.",
        "LORELAI: You seriously don't smell that?",
        "RORY: We can get one cup of coffee, and then I have to get to class.",
        "LORELAI: I knew you were early.",
        "RORY: I'm not that early.",
        "[they walk out of the room. Lorelai sticks her head back in and sniffs]",
        "[opening credits]",
        "CUT TO YALE CLASSROOM",
        "[Rory walks into an empty classroom and sits down. She's very early for her class. She starts to leave, but another student walks in, so she stays. A teacher walks in and hands out some papers]",
        "TEACHER: Freshmen.",
        "CUT TO SOOKIE'S HOUSE",
        "[Lorelai and Sookie are sitting at the kitchen table going over some paperwork.]",
        "LORELAI: Sign and date.",
        "SOOKIE: Signing and dating.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, do you have your last check stub?",
        "SOOKIE: Yeah. Uh, here. Oh, remember that?",
        "LORELAI: Income.",
        "SOOKIE: Yeah.",
        "LORELAI: Those were the days, huh? Okay, my hand is cramping, and I'm done signing now.",
        "JACKSON: Sookie, can you hand me that screwdriver?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, hey, um, tomorrow we have to meet with Ted Oldaman and get our liability insurance instated before we can break ground on the inn. And that reminds me. . .um, Tom sent over the initial proposal for the work.",
        "SOOKIE: How much?",
        "LORELAI: I'll tell you later.",
        "SOOKIE: When?",
        "LORELAI: After you blow.",
        "SOOKIE: Come on.",
        "LORELAI: Once you have the baby, then you can have the cow.",
        "JACKSON: Okay, I think I got it.",
        "SOOKIE: Is it really that much?",
        "JACKSON: Here. I'm going to the nursery.",
        "LORELAI: Uh, it's $20,000 more than we thought.",
        "SOOKIE: $20,000? That sucks.",
        "LORELAI: I got the chimney report back.",
        "SOOKIE: Oh, shoot.",
        "[Jackson's voice comes over a speaker]",
        "JACKSON: Hello? Hello?",
        "LORELAI: What is that?",
        "SOOKIE: Jackson. He's trying to hook up the house's central sound system to the baby monitor.",
        "JACKSON: I am in the baby's room. I repeat, I am in the baby's room. Copy that.",
        "LORELAI: This is probably the cutest creepy thing he's done yet.",
        "JACKSON: Can anyone hear me? I repeat, can anyone hear me?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, Jackson!",
        "SOOKIE: You're supposed to use the walkie-talkie. [she speaks into the walkie talkie] Roger, roger, Jackson. We're receiving some feedback. I repeat, we're receiving some feed-",
        "JACKSON: Hello? Sookie?",
        "SOOKIE: Jackson, I'm receiving feed-",
        "JACKSON: Do you hear me? Sookie?",
        "SOOKIE: Yes, I can hear you. I -",
        "JACKSON: Sookie, just tell me if you can hear me.",
        "SOOKIE: Jackson, I can hear. . .I can hear you just fine!",
        "LORELAI: Oh yeah, this system's gonna work great.",
        "JACKSON: Why aren't you using the walkie-talkie?",
        "SOOKIE: It's not working.",
        "JACKSON: Here.",
        "SOOKIE: Hey, you know, I had a thought.",
        "LORELAI: Yes?",
        "SOOKIE: Well, obviously, it's gonna take some time to get the inn up and running, right?",
        "LORELAI: Right.",
        "SOOKIE: And until we do, we have absolutely no money coming in whatsoever.",
        "LORELAI: So it's a happy thought.",
        "SOOKIE: What do you think about starting a catering company?",
        "LORELAI: A catering company.",
        "SOOKIE: Yeah. You could plan the events, decorations, themes, and I can cook.",
        "LORELAI: Well. . .",
        "SOOKIE: And it wouldn't be for very long - just until the baby came.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, but. . .",
        "JACKSON: Okay, here.",
        "LORELAI: Sookie, I'm not really a party planner. I've never done that.",
        "SOOKIE: What are you talking about? You put on all those beautiful weddings at the inn. And the conventions -- the men in the hats and the buttons.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, but I had a staff at the inn and I had resources.",
        "SOOKIE: Oh, come on. It'll be so fun to work together again. Just think about it.",
        "LORELAI: Fine, I'll think about it.",
        "SOOKIE: Good.",
        "LORELAI: How long do I have to think about it?",
        "SOOKIE: About a week.",
        "LORELAI: Sookie.",
        "SOOKIE: Helen Thompson's son, Aaron, is having a birthday party and she asked me to cater, and I suggested that you plan it. She thought it was a fabulous idea. So she offered us the job and I just took it. It's Thursday. She wanted to do it on Aaron's actual birthday and I thought that was so sweet. Helen's like that, you know?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, I know.",
        "SOOKIE: I can call her right now and tell her no if that's what you want. I mean it, you say the word and it's off. Maybe we could just try this one just to see if you like it. Maybe.",
        "JACKSON: Okay, Sookie, can you hear me now? Hello?",
        "SOOKIE: Jackson, I can hear you.",
        "JACKSON: Use the monitor!",
        "SOOKIE: Sorry!",
        "CUT TO YALE DORM",
        "[Rory walks into the dorm. Another student rushes past her]",
        "STUDENT: Russian economics sucks.",
        "RORY: I will make a note.",
        "[Rory walks into her suite to find the common room completely redecorated]",
        "RORY: Tanna? Tanna?",
        "TANNA: What?",
        "RORY: Where did this come from?",
        "TANNA: What?",
        "RORY: This - the furniture, the couch, the chairs, the rug.",
        "TANNA: I don't know. It must've been here when I got back.",
        "[Rory's cell phone rings]",
        "RORY: [answers] Hello?",
        "EMILY: I was going to wait until you called me, but my life isn't as long as yours. Did you sit on the couch?",
        "RORY: The couch?",
        "EMILY: I didn't want to get it too soft because I knew you would be studying there as well as watching television, and you would need a little bit of support.",
        "RORY: You did this?",
        "EMILY: Of course I did it. My granddaughter's a Yalie now. She needs to live like a Yalie.",
        "RORY: But how? When?",
        "EMILY: I snuck in yesterday when you were in classes just to measure to make sure everything would fit. Then I had to butter up your dippy freshman counselor so she'd let the movers in. Did you look in the entertainment center yet?",
        "RORY: No. Oh.",
        "EMILY: That's a plasma TV with a VCR and a DVD player. There's also a five-CD changer and a turntable, and the whole thing is wired in 5.1 surround sound. Now I have no idea what that means, but the man who installed it said to get Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon. It's supposed to be amazing.",
        "RORY: Grandma, this is all really sweet, but I have roommates, you know? And this might make them a little uncomfortable.",
        "EMILY: Uncomfortable about what?",
        "RORY: Well, um, this is a common room. It is common to all of us.",
        "EMILY: Mmhmm.",
        "RORY: Four of us who live here. There are four of us who live here together. And the common room. . .it's what we all have in common.",
        "EMILY: Oh, just show them how to use the remote. I'm sure they'll be fine with everything.",
        "RORY: Grandma, I worry that by you giving me all these things, it kind of makes it my room.",
        "EMILY: Exactly.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "EMILY: Never underestimate the value of the upper hand, Rory. You are in the real world now. Status matters.",
        "RORY: But -",
        "EMILY: Your grandfather and I are very proud of you. Enjoy the furniture. We'll see you on Friday.",
        "RORY: Okay, see you Friday. [hangs up] My grandmother broke into our room and furnished it.",
        "TANNA: Did she put that fireplace in, too?",
        "RORY: No, Tanna, the fireplace was always. . . hey, why don't we take a little tour of the place, okay?",
        "TANNA: Great.",
        "RORY: Yeah.",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "[Lorelai enters the house carrying some takeout. She goes into the kitchen, grabs a plate and a napkin, then heads to the living room. She grabs the cordless phone, and as she sits down on the couch, it rings]",
        "LORELAI: [answers phone] They burnt my fries, forgot to give me an extra side of barbecue sauce, the jeep is making that crunchy sound again, and I have to spend my evening making elf ears for Aaron Thompson's Lord of the Rings party.",
        "RORY: Grandma broke into my dorm and redid the entire common room in $25,000 worth of furniture and stereo equipment.",
        "LORELAI: You win.",
        "RORY: It's unbelievable. You should see this place. I feel like I'm at Uday's house.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, tell me the whole story.",
        "RORY: I came home and all the normal furniture was gone and all this stuff was in here.",
        "LORELAI: What did your roommates say?",
        "RORY: Tanna still doesn't know she's at Yale, Paris saw it and said nothing.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, so that's coming.",
        "RORY: Janet's out jogging so I don't know what she thinks, but I have to hope she's pleased 'cause that girl's in shape and can kick my butt.",
        "LORELAI: Well, just make sure there's something she likes on the TV when she gets home. Something soothing to runners - maybe something that goes in a circle over and over.",
        "RORY: This is bad. This is a total invasion of privacy.",
        "LORELAI: I know.",
        "RORY: She didn't even ask. She got rid of everything that was in here. What if some of that furniture belonged to someone and they wanted it? I don't know what she was thinking.",
        "LORELAI: She was thinking, \"Rory's life - mine. Must cover with chenille.\"",
        "RORY: I can't believe she did this.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, yes, you can.",
        "RORY: Excuse me?",
        "LORELAI: Well, Rory, come on, it's my mother. It's Emily Gilmore. This is what she does. You've seen her pull stunts like this on me for years.",
        "RORY: Yeah, but that was you.",
        "LORELAI: I told you when you borrowed that money from her that this is what you were getting into.",
        "RORY: I can't believe you're gloating.",
        "LORELAI: I'm not gloating. I'm just saying, when you sleep with dogs, you wake up with an entertainment center.",
        "RORY: Fine, so what do I do?",
        "LORELAI: Well, you could come out and say, \"Grandma, this furniture is very nice. I appreciate the gesture, but this is a dorm room, and I cannot guarantee that the other people will love it as much as I do, and I worry about expensive equipment getting stolen, and it's just maybe too much right now.\"",
        "RORY: That sounds good.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. And then my mother will say, \"Rory, your grandfather and I are paying for you to go to Yale. We are enabling you to have this rarefied education, and you're being ungrateful and small-minded, and I resent it. I am hurt on a level you will not be able to understand until you yourself have a daughter or a granddaughter who will cut your heart out the way you've just cut mine out, and I hope that small veneer of independence that you've extracted from this incident is worth the complete and total alienation of the grandparents who have done nothing but love you and thought of you only.\"",
        "RORY: Or I could keep the furniture.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, you could.",
        "RORY: This is great.",
        "LORELAI: Hon, seriously, if you feel strongly, say something. I just want you to be prepared, that's all.",
        "RORY: I know.",
        "LORELAI: And take heart in knowing that when it comes to controlling a person, my mother targeted my soul, my independence, and my entire future, and at least with you, she threw in an ottoman.",
        "CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE",
        "[Richard arrives home and walks to the living room where Emily is looking through swatches of fabric]",
        "RICHARD: Emily? I'm home.",
        "EMILY: I keep wanting to give this room a little spruce, but for the life of me, every one of these fabrics gives me a headache. What do you think of this one?",
        "RICHARD: Hm? It's fine.",
        "EMILY: Well, that's just the sort of enthusiasm I was looking for.",
        "RICHARD: Emily, you have excellent taste. I'm sure whichever one you pick will look lovely.",
        "EMILY: Do you need some ice?",
        "RICHARD: Uh, no. A taller glass.",
        "EMILY: You sound tired.",
        "RICHARD: It's been a very long day.",
        "EMILY: You know, some men retire.",
        "RICHARD: Yes, and some men tattoo their mother's names on their biceps.",
        "EMILY: I don't think the two are necessarily linked.",
        "RICHARD: I'm fine, Emily. I just need a drink and a nice meal, and I'll be good as new.",
        "EMILY: You got a call from Jason Stiles today.",
        "RICHARD: Digger Stiles? What did he want?",
        "EMILY: To talk to you.",
        "RICHARD: I have nothing to say to him.",
        "EMILY: He might have something interesting to tell you.",
        "RICHARD: What - that the turncoat company I used to work for is cutting my pension? That the stock they gave me when they unceremoniously forced me out has been rescinded?",
        "EMILY: Yes. That, or hello.",
        "RICHARD: He's probably been sent to do his father's dirty work. It's not enough to fire me, they have to continue to harass me now that I'm gone.",
        "EMILY: I thought you always liked Digger.",
        "RICHARD: Yes, I liked Digger when he was fetching my coffee. I liked Digger when he was refilling my stapler. But I do not like Digger now that he is his father's heir apparent and sent to annoy me. And I certainly don't understand your need to defend him.",
        "EMILY: I'm not defending him. If you don't want to return the boy's call, don't return his call.",
        "RICHARD: Thank you.",
        "EMILY: I invited him over tomorrow anyway. You can find out what he wants then.",
        "RICHARD: You did what?",
        "EMILY: Well, he was absolutely insistent that he talk to you.",
        "RICHARD: Why would you do that?",
        "EMILY: It was the polite thing to do. If you don't want him to come over, I have his number. You may call him and disinvite him. It's up to you.",
        "RICHARD: Fine, he can come over, but he is not staying for a drink. He can come in and deliver his message and then leave.",
        "EMILY: Whatever you say.",
        "RICHARD: That's it - no drink, no handshake, nothing.",
        "EMILY: I'll even hide the liquor bottles so he doesn't get any bright ideas.",
        "RICHARD: It's extremely comforting to have such a supportive wife in times like these.",
        "EMILY: I'm so glad.",
        "CUT TO YALE DORM",
        "[Rory is on the couch in the common room when Paris walks in]",
        "PARIS: Did you hear?",
        "RORY: Hear what?",
        "PARIS: The first party of the year is going to be on our floor.",
        "RORY: Oh yeah?",
        "PARIS: Technically, it's to celebrate the first week of classes, but I'm anticipating the themes quickly degenerating to \"Hey, walking works -- let's drink.\" The important thing is that this party, the first party, is going to be on our floor. Our floor.",
        "RORY: Yes, our floor.",
        "PARIS: Anyhow, the way it works is that anyone who wants to be apart of the party will just leave their door open so people can just wander in and out. So what do you think?",
        "RORY: About what?",
        "PARIS: Leaving our door open. It's the perfect opportunity to solidify our social standing at Yale. It'll virtually guarantee invitations to every other party thrown this year, and we'll get our faces in people's heads.",
        "RORY: I don't know.",
        "PARIS: What, what don't you know? I've explained the entire thing to you.",
        "RORY: Well, I'm not sure I want to leave our door open to a bunch of strangers.",
        "PARIS: Well, they won't be strangers once they come in and say howdy.",
        "RORY: Yeah, but I'm not sure how I'm gonna feel that night. I might be tired.",
        "PARIS: For God's sakes, Grandpa, you're eighteen. Sleep when you're dead.",
        "RORY: Look, we can still go to the party. We can meet people, you can solidify your social status, get your face in people's heads, and I can bail when I feel like it.",
        "PARIS: Going isn't the same. Going is passive. Opening your door, you are giving the party. You are responsible for the fun. People owe you. Don't you want people to owe you?",
        "RORY: I'm good, actually.",
        "PARIS: Oh, sure, you're good. You're fine. After all, you have all this fancy furniture and a big TV to lord over people. It's the rest of us who are screwed - the ones whose grandparents hadn't thought to provide suck-up furniture.",
        "RORY: This is not suck-up furniture.",
        "PARIS: You're being selfish. You don't care about anybody but yourself.",
        "RORY: Paris.",
        "PARIS: No. I hate college!",

        "[Lorelai and Sookie are sitting at the kitchen table]",
        "LORELAI: Okay, we've got costumes, we're got cutouts, we've got rings, ladies and gentlemen. We've got fairy necklaces, we've got tree heads. I'm picking up table decorations tomorrow. Oh, do you need me to order a Lord of the Rings cake?",
        "SOOKIE: The cake is under control.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, cake's off my list. So you've got the menu going, right?",
        "SOOKIE: Yes.",
        "LORELAI: Just festive kiddie food. You know, like, uh, bagel dogs, tater tots, mini pizzas, mac and cheese. Oh, you know what would be great? Those colored popcorn balls. Rory used to go mental over those things.",
        "SOOKIE: Hey, how many adults are gonna be there?",
        "LORELAI: Probably about ten.",
        "SOOKIE: Okay.",

She likes to get up in front of the family after dinner and sing Mariah Carey songs. I heckle. I have no desire to play with them. Easter egg hunts bore me. I have never borrowed the neighbor's kid to look after for the afternoon.",
