        "T.J. is milking his injuries for all he's worth, but Luke decides that it's time to go home after seven weeks on the Ren Faire circuit; Rory calls to apologize and to ask her mother to deliver a letter to Dean; Sookie accurately diagnoses Lorelai with a bad case of management burnout, and the two friends decide to decompress with a girls-day-out; Emily and Rory come home exhausted from fending off the attentions of randy European men; Michel is wildly unenthusiastic when he's pressed into babysitting for guests whose children take an inexplicable shine to him; after Lindsay finds Rory's letter, she throws Dean and all his possessions out of the house, and her mother has an angry confrontation with Lorelai in the town square; Lane realizes that she's falling for Zack; Rory is saddened when Dean expresses regret for the shift in their relationship and the harm it caused to his wife and their families."

        "OPEN TO STARS HOLLOW SIDEWALK",
        "[Lorelai walks very quickly down the sidewalk passing some of the vendor stands]",
        "LORELAI: Morning, Al. Morning, Fred. Morning, Sam.",
        "[She drops envelope in a corner nailbox and continues past a man handing out pamphlets.]",
        "MAN: Cider Mill's opening Saturday. Big parade and free cider for one and all.",
        "LORELAI: Thank you. [Never slowing her pace, she takes the offered paper and quickly hands it out to the next person she passes.] Cider mill's opening Saturday. Big parade and free cider for one and all.",
        "WOMAN: Thank you.",
        "[Lorelai approaches Miss Patty's dance studio where Patty is instructing several small dancing apples.]",
        "PATTY: Keep it going, kids. You're red, you're delicious. You're about to have the juice sucked out of you. [She smiles as Lorelai passes] There she is -- our spunky entrepreneur.",
        "LORELAI: I am the uber-Trump-Murdoch-Maximus. [She glances back] Oop. Apple down.",
        "PATTY: Apple down. [pauses before reacting] Apple down! Hold it, everybody! Apple down! Okay, roll her over. [calls after the rapidly disappearing Lorelai] Have a nice day.",
        "MAN: [OS, continues to call out] Big parade, free cider for one and all.",
        "[OPEN TO LUKE'S DINER]",
        "[Lane is standing behind counter taking a food order from a woman]",
        "LANE: ...and two eggs over easy, got it. Just be a couple minutes. [tears order from her pad and places it on the kitchen ledge] Caesar, order.",
        "[Lane smoothly walks around the counter, passing Zach and Brian sitting at a corner table.]",
        "BRIAN: Since they were both actually royalty, their child would have a real claim to the Judean throne, see? So Mary Magdalene goes to Gaul to have the kid. She's also supposed to run the church after his death, but that's not what Peter wants, right? But all that got covered up later by Constantine after the council of Nicea purged the Christian --",
        "ZACH: Oh, my god! Will you stop talking about this!",
        "BRIAN: This is, like, the number-one book in the country.",
        "ZACH: Well, it's my number-one bummer.",
        "[Lane approaches]",
        "LANE: Okay, guys, what'll you have?",
        "ZACH: Burger for me -- nothing healthy on it, extra cheese -- and, of course, an order of...wink-winkers.",
        "LANE: [slightly annoyed] You don't have to call them that, Zach.",
        "ZACH: Just want to make myself clear.",
        "LANE: Look, I told you guys I'd throw you free fries -- not a big deal since they're usually the ones we wind up throwing out anyway from making too many, which means you don't have to call them wink-winkers or nudge-nudgies or know-what-I-meanies or anything else in verbal code, especially if it's cute-cutesy.",
        "ZACH: I will abide by that.",
        "LANE: Brian?",
        "BRIAN: Same thing -- burger and fries. [wiggles eyebrows knowingly]",
        "ZACH: Dude, that's cute-cutesy.",
        "BRIAN: She said not to be verbally cute-cutesy.",
        "ZACH: It was a blanket moratorium on anything cutesy concerning the fries.",
        "LANE: I'll be back. [walks away]",
        "ZACH: Cokes, too.",
        "BRIAN: Better get my money ready. [pulls hands full of loose change onto the table]",
        "ZACH: That's not embarrassing.",
        "[Lorelai enters the diner and greets Lane]",
        "LORELAI: Hi, Lane.",
        "LANE: Lorelai, hi. Would you like your usual to go?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, and quick-quick, please.",
        "LANE: [picks up coffee pot] You know, people are calling you \"the blur.\"",
        "LORELAI: That's mean. Or is it? What is that?",
        "LANE: [pours coffee into a To-Go cup] You're not around, and you're always running -- swoosh, blur.",
        "LORELAI: Well, that's business, baby. If you slow down, they might catch up with you. [glances around] Still no Luke, huh?",
        "LANE: Liz and T.J. are still not back up on their feet. Luke's calling the Renaissance Faire his \"Vietnam without all the fun shooting.\" [hands Lorelai her cup]",
        "LORELAI: Oh, poor guy.",
        "LANE: I made it extra strong. It should blacken your teeth and rot your stomach. [continues working]",
        "LORELAI: Bless you. [glances at a chain of colorful postcards on the nearby bulletin board]",
        "LANE: [appears] All from Rory.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, I'm sorry. Just being nosey.",
        "LANE: No, go ahead, read. I'm sure it's stuff she already told you.",
        "LORELAI: [adds cream to her coffee] Yeah, probably.",
        "LANE: [hands Lorelai a small sack] You are ready to swoosh.",
        "LORELAI: The blur is off. [gathers items and begins to leave]",
        "LANE: And don't overtip.",
        "LORELAI: Try and stop me. [sneaks some dollar bills on the counter as she quickly passes]",
        "LORELAI: Hey, guys.",
        "ZACH: Hey, Lorelai. Get yourself a wink-winker?",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "LANE: Please erase this from your brain. [sets plate of fries on Zach and Brian's table as she passes]",
        "LORELAI: I will definitely try.",
        "[CUT TO RENAISSANCE FAIRE - LIZ AND T.J.'S BOOTH]",
        "[Liz talks to two fellow Renaissance Faire merchants dressed in period costumes]",
        "LIZ: I'm telling you, I was going crazy. I was in pain for six weeks. It was fractured in three places. That's why it took so long to heal. But thank God for my big brother. [ Women giggling as Luke passes]",
        "HENRY: Morning, Lucas. [approaches carrying large box]",
        "LUKE: Hey, Henry. How's your beard?",
        "HENRY: [ Laughs ] You always ask that, and I always laugh.",
        "LUKE: Well, it's our thing.",
        "HENRY: Hey, come here. Got some dish. [motions Luke to come closer] You know Hay Bale Bill, the guy that totes the hay bales?",
        "LUKE: I seen him around.",
        "HENRY: Got caught in a tent last night with Annie from the grog booth.",
        "LUKE: Hm. Isn't she engaged to the fruit-ice guy?",
        "HENRY: Yeah, and the fruit-ice guy comes back, and there's Annie and Hay Bale, so he tears the tent to pieces.",
        "LUKE: Hm.",
        "HENRY: Now the grog people have to hide her. They set up a fort made out of kegs.",
        "LUKE: [intrigued] Crazy stuff.",
        "HENRY: I'll keep you posted. [exits]",
        "LUKE: All right. See you later.",
        "[Luke pulls necklace merchandise from a box and drapes each on wooden display branches. T.J., in full costume, reclines nearby, arm in a sling - blanket in his lap.]",
        "T.J.: Luuuuuuuke?",
        "LUKE: What, T.J.?",
        "T.J.: You're putting the pewter next to the turquoise?",
        "LUKE: Looks like it.",
        "T.J.: We don't usually put the pewter next to the turquoise.",
        "LUKE: Well, I'm a maverick.",
        "T.J.: Mm-hmm. [ Slurps from his tankard] Ahh. Might be why the pewter ain't moving.",
        "LUKE: Pewter's moving just fine, T.J.",
        "[Woman dressed in period garb approaches Luke]",
        "WOMAN: Excuse me?",
        "LUKE: Oh, hi, there. Can I help you?",
        "WOMAN: Yeah. I'm looking for the Shakespeare stage.",
        "LUKE: Okay, uh, you walk past the Calumba booth, veer right at the drinking horns, then left at the antler ark.",
        "WOMAN: Thank you. [thankful look then leaves]",
        "LUKE: Mm-hmm.",
        "[Walks around booth to organize table items]",
        "T.J.: Luuuuuke?",
        "LUKE: [strained patience] What, T.J.?",
        "T.J.: You didn't use the approved Faire language with that customer.",
        "LUKE: Maverick -- me. Don't forget that.",
        "T.J.: There's undercover Faire officials walking around. They look for that kind of stuff",
        "LUKE: Well, they should get real jobs.",
        "T.J.: Would it kill you to shoot her a \"Good-morrow\"?",
        "LUKE: Look, T.J. -- [approaches T.J.'s chaise and hears baseball announcer sounds coming from beneath T.J. lap blanket. He snatches away the cover to reveal a very small television set] I don't believe it.",
        "T.J.: [feigns innocence] I know. The Yanks went with Mussina. They should have gone with Brown.",
        "LUKE: You're watching T.V.!",
        "T.J.: I'm not ready for my nap.",
        "LUKE: You're milking it.",
        "T.J.: I'm convalescing.",
        "LUKE: And you're milking me. But no more. Find some help, get a crutch, because by week's end, I'm gone.",
        "T.J.: Liz, you hearing this?",
        "LIZ: What? [pulls ear phones out of her ears] I'm sorry. I was listening to my Deepak Chopra.",
        "LUKE: I got things to do. I got a business, hopefully a life.",
        "[people in costume walk by, noticing the disturbance]",
        "T.J.: Uh, prithee, you jest, good sir, and leave us short of hand?",
        "LUKE: I ain't jesting.",
        "T.J.: But my arm!",
        "LUKE: Had no trouble reaching into a tub of caramel corn last night while you were scratching yourself with the other. Your dexterity's fine.",
        "LIZ: [resigned] T.J., It's time for him to go.",
        "T.J.: [attempting to instill guilt] So, you're gonna break up the team?",
        "LUKE: I'm no good to you. I'm not moving the pewter. [walks off... then returns and grabs the little television] Don't want you to get in trouble with the undercover squad.",
        "[CUT TO ITALY - LUXURIOUS HOTEL SUITE]",
        "[The Concierge enters followed by Emily, Rory and a plethora of bellhops with vast amounts of luggage.]",
        "CONCIERGE LUCIANO: Hallo, and here we are -- room 518. A beautiful room -- very special for you, Mrs. Gilmore.",
        "RORY: It's nice.",
        "EMILY: It's hot.",
        "LUCIANO: [quickly reacts to assist] I will adjust the air for you. No problem on my end. [watches Emily walk to the balcony opening to observe the view] It's a spectacular view. Very nice. A little balcony there.",
        "EMILY: [frowns] It's different.",
        "LUCIANO: Something is different?",
        "EMILY: The view -- it's different.",
        "RORY: [Rory and Luciano join Emily at the balcony wall] Wow. It's pretty spectacular.",
        "EMILY: It's not the same.",
        "LUCIANO: It's the same room you had two years ago, Signora -- 518.",
        "EMILY: The ruins -- they used to be closer. Something move?",
        "LUCIANO: I don't think so.",
        "EMILY: That pillar is in a different place.",
        "RORY: I think the ruins are probably where they've been for the past 2,000 years, Grandma.",
        "LUCIANO: We can get you another room, signora. No problem.",
        "EMILY: No, no, it's fine. [returns to the main room, pauses then frowns] Smokers.",
        "LUCIANO: I despise smokers.",
        "[Rory shuffles through the luggage cart valet]",
        "EMILY: Rory, I told you before, you do not move luggage.",
        "LUCIANO: Yes, yes, please. We will do that.",
        "RORY: Sorry.",
        "EMILY: Your high tea is still at the same time?",
        "LUCIANO: Si, signora.",
        "EMILY: We'll need to book some private tours -- the Vatican, the Villa Medici. And private -- just the two of us. The concierge in Florence stuck us with a Belgian couple at the Uffizi who didn't know a fresco from a ferret hole. And the ruins, of course. Make sure the guide's not too dry. [absently gazes out the patio window] So different. [quickly follows a luggage-laden bell hop another room] The hanging bags should be hung, not laid on the bed.",
        "RORY: Excuse me. How far away are we from the catacombs?",
        "LUCIANO: Close, but your grandmother would not like the catacombs. Bones disturb her.",
        "RORY: It's for me. My grandmother usually takes a nap this time of day, so I go off and do my own thing.",
        "LUCIANO: [wistful look] Ah, yes, a nap.",
        "[Emily briskly returns to the main room]",
        "EMILY: We need two more pillows.",
        "LUCIANO: I will see to it. Anything else I can do?",
        "EMILY: That should do it. Thank you, Luciano.",
        "RORY: Yeah, thank you very much.",
        "LUCIANO: Grazie mille. Buona notte. Good evening. Thank you. [exits]",
        "EMILY: Let's sit down and pick our restaurants. That's three nights -- that's three lunches and three dinners. We'll take our usual passeggiata around the piazza navana, but let's pick the restaurants. [enthusiastically riffles through the brochures]",
        "RORY: Do you want to pick them before your nap or after?",
        "EMILY: I'm skipping my nap today.",
        "RORY: Oh, really? [Disappointed, she joins her grandmother on the sofa.]",
        "EMILY: Absolutely. I'm not the least bit tired. [covertly watches Rory's reaction]",
        "RORY: Oh, good.",
        "EMILY: Couldn't hide it any better than that, huh?",
        "RORY: Hide what?",
        "EMILY: I don't take my nap, you don't get to go out on your own.",
        "RORY: Oh...[ Scoffs ] Grandma, I wasn't thinking that.",
        "EMILY: Well, I was kidding. I'm exhausted. I'm not sure I'll even make it to the bedroom. I may just drop down here on the carpet.",
        "RORY: Thank you, Grandma. It's all cultural stuff, I promise. Just kind of faster and funkier.",
        "EMILY: Well, go enjoy your funk.",
        "RORY: Thank you. [kisses Emily's cheek]",
        "EMILY: Mm-hmm. [Rory walks over to the luggage cart] Say, when was the last time we called your mother?",
        "RORY: Not sure. [shifts the shoulder strap of a leather tourist bag over her shoulder]",
        "EMILY: Have we called her this week?",
        "RORY: I think you did.",
        "EMILY: We'll call when you come back.",
        "RORY: Okay. Bye. [exits]",
        "EMILY: Bye-bye. [calls after her and continues to read brochures]",
        "[CUT TO DRAGONFLY INN - INTERIOR ENTRY]",
        "[Lorelai briskly enters as a male guest crosses her path]",
        "MALE GUEST: 'Morning.",
        "LORELAI: 'Morning. [crosses over to reception desk]",
        "ROB: Morning.",
        "LORELAI: Oh hey Rob, I want to keep these brochures nice and neat in the rack here, none of them askew. Otherwise, it gives the place that \"we'll leave the light on for you\" feel that we're desperately trying to avoid.",
        "ROB: Yeah, I checked it. [watches her shuffle the papers inside the display box]",
        "LORELAI: That is, if we ultimately decide that we don't mind having brochures here in the lobby. The jury's still out on that. [very brief pause] You know what? Jury's back. Brochures are out. [picks of the wooden box] I'll just take this in the office and... [spies a figure crouching behind the reception desk] Michel...",
        "MICHEL: Good morning.",
        "LORELAI: Um, what are you doing? [impatient]",
        "MICHEL: Hiding.",
        "LORELAI: From me?",
        "MICHEL: No.",
        "LORELAI: From?",
        "MICHEL: Suffice to say, my hiding is not costing the inn any income. In fact, I'm overdue for my 10. So consider this my 10, and you are now conducting business with an employee who is officially on his 10, which is in direct violation of union rules.",
        "LORELAI: You're not in a union.",
        "MICHEL: I'm in a union of oppressed Frenchmen.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, the U.O.F. -- Got it. All right. Carry on.",
        "[ Sighs, then quickly walks to the next room and interrupts a maid dusting ]",
        "LORELAI: Oh, hey, there is a spot on the floor over here that the vacuum never quite reaches. Let's make sure it does. Thank you. [briskly continues walking though the inn. A family of four approaches Lorelai.] Hi. It's the Krumholtzes. How are you doing today?",
        "MR. KRUMHOLTZ: Great. Are you always here?",
        "LORELAI: I give that illusion. So, what's on the agenda today?",
        "MRS. KRUMHOLTZ: Mike and I would love to hit some antique stores.",
        "LORELAI: We can guide you to the best of them.",
        "MR. KRUMHOLTZ: But the kids would love to stay here. You got games and books, and they'd be bored stiff with us.",
        "LORELAI: They can absolutely stay here. There's always people around.",
        "MRS. KRUMHOLTZ: Is Michel going to be here?",
        "LORELAI: [sympathetic look] Yes.",
        "MRS. KRUMHOLTZ: Oh, good. He is their favorite.",
        "LORELAI: [disbelief] Michel? Have they met Michel? [to the children] Have you met Michel?",
        "LITTLE GIRL: He's funny!",
        "LITTLE BOY: Yeah!",
        "MR. KRUMHOLTZ: They love him. He chases them around and shouts and pretends to be mad, and they laugh and laugh.",
        "LORELAI: Well, Michel is here, and I'm sure he would be happy to look after you guys while your parents are gone. In fact, he's playing hide-and-seek right now, and if you go over to the reception area, I guarantee you'll be getting warm, warmer, hot.",
        "LITTLE BOY: Goodie! Let's go! Come on!",
        "LITTLE GIRL: [giggles]",
        "LORELAI: Have a good day. [enters dining room and picks up a coffee pot on nearby table.] Morning! Who needs coffee? Oh, I'll get you some coffee right there. [a waiter approaches and takes pot from Lorelai.] Oh, hey, when Sookie gets in, tell her I want to go over the layout for the dinner menu. I want to go another way. I'll be in my office. Thank you. [busily walks off]",
        "[Lorelai circles back to front lobby and sees Michel attached to two young children] Hey, you found him. Good job, Krumholtzes.",
        "LITTLE BOY: [gleefully] He grounded us and told us to go do something to ourselves.",
        "LITTLE GIRL: [grins] He used a dirty word.",
        "MICHEL: And I'm destined to use many more.",
        "LORELAI: No, you're not. Come here. [grabs and drags Michel aside by his lapel]",
        "MICHEL: It is not my job to entertain little people.",
        "LORELAI: Michel, the Krumholtzes are in our most expensive room. We need people like them to be happy so they tell other people like them they we're happy - because we are a new business, and we all have to go above and beyond the call of duty until we are established.",
        "MICHEL: So you watch them.",
        "LORELAI: I hate kids.",
        "MICHEL: This isn't fair.",
        "LORELAI: You're a profit participant. Happy Krumholtzes equal lots of profits, participant. [physically turns him around and approach the children]",
        "MICHEL: [fake charm] Who wants to play some insipid board game with me?",
        "LITTLE GIRL: We want to play an insipid board game!",
        "LITTLE BOY: Yeah! [running off] Let's play Chinese checkers!",
        "[Lorelai climbs stairs as her cellular phone rings ]",
        "LORELAI: Hello?",
        "EMILY: [loudly] Lorelai, it's your mother!",
        "LORELAI: Hi, Mom.",
        "EMILY: [loudly] I'm calling from Rome!",
        "LORELAI: The line is crystal clear. You don't have to yell.",
        "EMILY: Sorry -- I still think transcontinental calls are a bigger deal than they are.",
        "LORELAI: You're coming in fine. So, Rome?",
        "EMILY: Our last stop, and a good thing, too, because I don't know how long I can keep these randy European men off me.",
        "LORELAI: Excuse me? [enters a room scrutinizing everything while maid puts fresh sheets on bed]",
        "EMILY: They're terrible flirts here. Gorgeous, but so forward. Do you want to talk to Rory?",
        "LORELAI: [unenthusiastically] Oh, um, sure. Is she there? [shoos away a maid and takes sheet herself. Maid looks unhappy.]",
        "EMILY: Yes, she is. Hang on. Rory!",
        "RORY: Hello?",
        "LORELAI'S VOICE: [attempts cheer] Hi.",
        "RORY: Hi.",
        "LORELAI: So, Rome? [struggles with sheet while pinning cell phone between shoulder and ear]",
        "RORY: Yep.",
        "LORELAI: Weather good?",
        "RORY: Hot in the day, cooler at night.",
        "LORELAI: Uh-huh, that's kind of what we're having here.",
        "RORY: Huh. Coinky-dink.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah. So...",
        "RORY: So...",
        "LORELAI: Um, I guess I'll be seeing you in a couple of days. [attempts to smooth sheet unsuccessfully]",
        "RORY: Yep.",
        "LORELAI: Great, then. Be safe, and watch out for those Italian men, especially the ones named Randy.",
        "RORY: I will. Bye.",
        "LORELAI: Bye. [angrily yanks off flat sheet] Didn't look like a quarter would bounce off it. [hands sheet to the confused maid and hurries off] Got to have those bouncing quarters.",
        "[CUT TO ITALIAN SIDEWALK CAF\u00c9]",
        "[Emily and Rory carry shopping packages as they select an empty table]",
        "EMILY: I think the pink purse with the gold clasp is my favorite.",
        "RORY: We probably could have gotten all this stuff at home, Grandma. Now we have to pay duty on them.",
        "EMILY: But if you buy them back in the States, then you can't say, \"I picked this up in Rome.\" [young Italian waiter approaches]",
        "WAITER: Buon giorno. Hello. May I help you, please?",
        "EMILY: Buon giorno. [ Speaking Italian ]",
        "WAITER: Ah, la bellissima signora parlo italiano molto bene.",
        "EMILY: [extremely pleased as she sits] Grazie. He called me \"pretty lady.\" It just never stops.",
        "RORY: [still standing and looking around] You got the gams, Grandma.",
        "EMILY: [ Conversing with the waiter in Italian then - ] Rory? Rory?",
        "RORY: [distracted] Huh?",
        "EMILY: What do you want?",
        "RORY: Oh. A triple espresso. [She sits down with Emily.]",
