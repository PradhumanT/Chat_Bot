        "LORELAI: Ah. No music. I can't believe we forgot to bring tunes.",
        "RORY: Do you realize that neither of us has the vaguest idea where we are?",
        "LORELAI: What is a road tip without tunes?",
        "RORY: The sun is directly behind us.",
        "LORELAI: Never been in this car for any extended period of time without playing AC/DC.",
        "RORY: I have no idea which way it's going.",
        "LORELAI: I need my \"Highway to Hell.\"",
        "RORY: It's right out the windshield there.",
        "LORELAI: There's nothing on the radio but Top 40 and Christian Rock. Christian Rock, there's an oxymoron for you. I need my tunes.",
        "RORY: Stop complaining about the tunes!",
        "LORELAI: Stop complaining about our whereabouts.",
        "RORY: Well, my complaint is legitimate, yours is infantile.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, you're right. [turns on radio] Ooh, ooh, yee-haw, yes. Country music, must be my lucky day.",
        "RORY: [turns off radio] We have to figure out where we're going.",
        "LORELAI: No we don't.",
        "RORY: Mom.",
        "LORELAI: The point of this is to be spontaneous. To drive and land someplace we've never been and never expected to be.",
        "RORY: Sounds risky.",
        "LORELAI: Sounds exciting.",
        "RORY: Serendipity has never been kind to us.",
        "LORELAI: Ah, yes, but I talked to serendipity on the phone last night. She feels bad about how she's treated us in the past. We had a nice chat. It's all gonna be different now.",
        "RORY: What did that sign say? It said \"Don't\" or \"Death\" on it.",
        "LORELAI: Relax.",
        "RORY: We're doomed!",
        "LORELAI: Wrong. We're being guided by fate.",
        "RORY: I think we're lost.",
        "LORELAI: We can't be lost. We don't know where we're going.",
        "RORY: You're going to stop before we drive into the Atlantic Ocean.",
        "LORELAI: I'll try.",
        "RORY: At least we'll know where we are.",

        "LORELAI: You know what, I love road food.",
        "RORY: I love it too.",
        "LORELAI: I mean, what can be better then what they serve at a Haden's Nut House?",
        "RORY: Unless you don't like nuts.",
        "LORELAI: As if those people exist. You know, if I was in a rock band touring and stuff, I'd make the bus driver stop at every Haden's Nut House we pass.",
        "RORY: Wow, your Behind the Music is gonna be really wild.",
        "CUT TO INSIDE JEEP",
        "RORY: Okay, so if we continue on the way we've been going who are you calling?",
        "LORELAI: [dialing her cell phone] Uh, Sookie.",
        "RORY: Now?",
        "LORELAI: Uh, well, I didn't get a chance to call her before we left so she doesn't know about the",
        "RORY: Oh.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah.",
        "RORY: You okay?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, I guess. It's just, um Hi Sookie, it's me.",
        "SOOKIE: [at the Inn] Hi Sweetie, you on your way in?",
        "LORELAI: Um, no, not yet. Actually, I'm um, I'm gonna be out of town for a couple of days.",
        "SOOKIE: What?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, Rory and I decided to hit the road.",
        "SOOKIE: But how can you be hitting the road? You're supposed to be getting",
        "LORELAI: The engagement is off, Sookie.",
        "SOOKIE: What? What happened?",
        "LORELAI: Well, it's a long story. I don't really wanna go into all the whats and whys and gory details right now, but you should know we all still love Max, and to figure out exactly what happened, you'd have to dig up Freud himself and have him work on me full time.",
        "SOOKIE: Aww, honey, I'm so sorry.",
        "LORELAI: Thanks. So I hope you didn't get too far on that cake.",
        "SOOKIE: [looking at almost-completed 5-tier cake] No, no, no. That's one thing you can be thankful about. You caught me in plenty of time.",
        "LORELAI: Good. I know the kind of work you were gonna put into it, and I just would've killed myself if you'd gone to all that craziness for nothing.",
        "SOOKIE: Yeah, well, I've been so busy lately, I actually forgot about it.",
        "LORELAI: Listen, do me a favor. Mention canceling the wedding to Miss Patty, will you? That way, by the time we get back",
        "SOOKIE: The whole town will know within the hour.",
        "LORELAI: Then hopefully they will all have chatted it out of their systems before we get home.",
        "SOOKIE: Consider it done. So where you going?",
        "LORELAI: We have no idea.",
        "SOOKIE: Ah, my favorite kind of trip.",
        "LORELAI: Well, thanks. I'll talk to you soon. Just call the cell if you need anything.",
        "SOOKIE: Okie dokie. Buh bye.",
        "LORELAI: Bye. [hangs up]",
        "SOOKIE: You were a good cake Clyde. I never should've named you.",

        "LORELAI: That had better not be a map.",
        "RORY: I'm sorry, but I'm openly defying your no map policy.",
        "LORELAI: Rory.",
        "RORY: Mom, it's gonna be dark in a couple of hours and I don't want to sleep in the car.",
        "LORELAI: Ugh, my sense of adventure did not translate to my offspring.",
        "RORY: Now, to the best of my map reading abilities, we're headed towards Portsmouth, New Hampshire.",
        "LORELAI: Portsmouth. Huh.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: I actually have a friend in Portsmouth. Donald, uhh, something-or-other Stein.",
        "RORY: A close personal friend, huh?",
        "LORELAI: Donald moved there a couple of years ago and opened a B&B.",
        "RORY: Ughhh.",
        "LORELAI: No, it's actually supposed to be pretty cool.",
        "RORY: A cool B&B?",
        "LORELAI: Yes.",
        "RORY: That's like saying an understated Nicholas Cage movie.",
        "LORELAI: Listen, I myself am not usually a fan of the B&B, but Donald's place is different.",
        "RORY: Captain Corelli's Mandolin.",
        "LORELAI: I'm serious.",
        "RORY: 'Bella bambina at 2 o'clock.'",
        "LORELAI: Every room is decorated in a different weird style for a different century.",
        "RORY: That is kinda cool.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, let's go.",
        "RORY: Let's call.",
        "LORELAI: Let's go.",
        "RORY: Let's call.",

        "LORELAI: Hi.",
        "LADONN: Would you like to ring the bell?",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "LADONN: Would you like to ring the bell, you or your daughter?",
        "LORELAI: I don't understand.",
        "LADONN: I'm not usually sitting here when guests arrive, so people ring the bell and they love to ring the bell, and you didn't get to ring the bell.",
        "LORELAI: Uh. . . [rings bell]",
        "LADONN: Well done.",
        "LORELAI: Uh, do you have a room available?",
        "LADONN: Yes, we most certainly do, you lucky pretty things you.",
        "LORELAI: See they have a room.",
        "RORY: Good.",
        "LORELAI: Um, does Donald happen to be here?",
        "LADONN: Oh no no, I bought this place from Donald last year. It's my place now. I'm LaDonn.",
        "LORELAI: Hi. Oh, yes, I noticed it was a little different. Actually, very different.",
        "LADONN: Oh, did you see it before?",
        "LORELAI: Pictures.",
        "LADONN: Well, it was wacky, just like Donald. It was fun, you know, but just a little too woo-woo. It was just too eclectic. I don't care for eclectic. I don't think B&B-ers do either.",
        "LORELAI: No, you wouldn't want anything out of the normal.",
        "LADONN: Okay, room number 3 is all yours. Welcome to the Cheshire Cat.",
        "LORELAI: Nice name. I'm gonna consult with my daughter for just one second. [walks away from the desk] We must leave this place immediately.",
        "RORY: And sleep where?",
        "LORELAI: Uh, a hollow tree, a riverbank, I don't care.",
        "RORY: Mom, I'm tired and I'm starving.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, she's named the place after an Alice in Wonderland character. This is my worst nightmare.",
        "RORY: And dying of exposure in a Jeep is mine.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, okay.",
        "[They walk back to LaDonn at the desk.]",
        "LORELAI: So, just point the way to room three.",
        "LADONN: I'll take you there myself. Let me just grab your bags.",
        "RORY: Oh, we can do that.",
        "LADONN: No no no no no, you are my guests. I won't hear of it. There you go.",
        "LORELAI: Oh.",
        "LADONN: Do you wanna ring the bell? You haven't rung the bell.",
        "RORY: Maybe some other time.",
        "LADONN: Follow me. [walks to staircase] Watch out for Sammy.",
        "LORELAI: Wowsie wowza.",
        "RORY: That's either Sammy or the cat that ate Sammy.",
        "[They walk up the steps past the cat.]",
        "CUT TO INSIDE ROOM 3",
        "[LaDonn walks through the door carrying the bags, followed by Lorelai and Rory.]",
        "LORELAI: Aghhh!",
        "LADONN: What is it, dear?",
        "LORELAI: Uhh, there's just a lot",
        "RORY: A lot of flowers.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, like a ton of flowers.",
        "RORY: A plethora of flowers.",
        "LORELAI: A load of flowers.",
        "LADONN: Thank you! I get so many compliments on this room.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, are they moving?",
        "LADONN: It looks like it, doesn't it? There's foil in the paper and it gives it that illusion. Isn't it terrific?",
        "LORELAI: Unbelievable.",
        "LADONN: B&B-ers love a peaceful setting so that they can unwind from their hectic lives. What business are you in, dear?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, me? Uh, publishing.",
        "LADONN: How interesting.",
        "LORELAI: Mm.",
        "LADONN: Now if you need anything, you just ring down or come down 'cause I love company. And, oh, I don't want to forget to give you our activity list. Never a dull moment around here.",
        "LORELAI: Thanks LaDonn.",
        "RORY: Yes, thank you.",
        "[LaDonn leaves]",
        "LORELAI: Okay, I think we just found the first room in the history of the world that would've made Liberace say 'Whoa. Step back. No one's that gay.'",
        "RORY: Oh, look. This is a book that past guests have written in.",
        "LORELAI: Mmm.",
        "RORY: 'This room made my soul soar.'",
        "LORELAI: Ugh.",
        "RORY: Ech.",
        "LORELAI: All right, enough grossness. Let's go eat.",
        "RORY: Oh food. I'm starving.",
        "CUT TO STAIRCASE",
        "[Lorelai and Rory start to walk down the steps, but stop when they see a bunch of people downstairs.]",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: Dentists. Boston dentists. Cocktail hour at the Cheshire Cat.",
        "RORY: So?",
        "LORELAI: So our exit is blocked.",
        "RORY: Let's just rush pass them.",
        "LORELAI: Too risky.",
        "RORY: They're not assassins.",
        "LORELAI: Rory, if they catch us they'll clamp onto us like leeches, and you know what that means.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: Chitchat. Stomach-churning, mind-numbing, soul-deadening chitchat.",
        "RORY: Mom, I'm starving. I'm going down there, you can stay here.",
        "LORELAI: You're that hungry, huh?",
        "RORY: Yes.",
        "LORELAI: Hungry enough to answer a hundred probing but only slightly differentiated from each other questions about Chilton, life in a small town, and your hunky hunky boyfriend?",
        "[Rory walks back up the steps. Lorelai follows.]",
        "CUT TO ROOM 3",
        "[Lorelai sits on the bed looking through her purse while Rory is in the bathroom.]",
        "LORELAI: Ohh, ahhh, I struck gold! [pulling something out of her purse]",
        "RORY: What is it?",
        "LORELAI: Certs.",
        "RORY: Let me catch my breath.",
        "LORELAI: I cannot for the life of me remember the last time I bought Certs.",
        "RORY: Which would make those really old.",
        "LORELAI: Fuzzy.",
        "[Lorelai puts it back in her purse. They both sit at the head of the bed. They hear music coming from downstairs.]",
        "RORY: Perfect.",
        "LORELAI: A nice capper to the day.",
        "RORY: In the course of three hours, they've participated in every inane B&B group activity known to man.",
        "LORELAI: Let's just hope they finish with a mass suicide.",
        "RORY: We get cranky when we're hungry.",
        "LORELAI: Well, plus we're above everyone else on the planet.",
        "RORY: Clearly.",
        "LORELAI: Hm.",
        "RORY: So what do you want to do?",
        "LORELAI: I don't know. We could go to sleep.",
        "RORY: Mm, it's 8:23.",
        "LORELAI: Good Lord.",
        "RORY: I'm not really sleepy.",
        "LORELAI: Me neither. We could sing.",
        "RORY: Sing?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, we could sing \"Anarchy in the UK\" at the top of our lungs.",
        "RORY: Oh, that would be good. Or, uh, we could talk.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, okay.",
        "RORY: Okay.",
        "LORELAI: What about?",
        "RORY: Oh, I don't know. Umm, Max?",
        "LORELAI: Uhh, no.",
        "RORY: Why?",
        "LORELAI: Because I don't want to.",
        "RORY: You said we could talk.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, well I thought you meant about makeup or something.",
        "RORY: When have we ever talked about makeup?",
        "LORELAI: Never, that's why I thought now would be a good time.",
        "RORY: I just need to know if",
        "LORELAI: Goodnight Rory.",
        "RORY: But",
        "LORELAI: Goodnight. [turns off light]",
        "RORY: [turns on light] Are you sure that you're not just running scared?",
        "LORELAI: Rory.",
        "RORY: Because I think that you really love him but you're just freaked out",
        "LORELAI: Enough! [turns out light]",
        "RORY: and you don't know what to do! [turns on light] Because you did this before. With Max, in fact.",
        "LORELAI: Rory, I don't want to talk about this. I thought that by saying 'enough' and turning off the light, you would get the message. Apparently not. The skywriter will be here in a minute.",
        "RORY: I'm asking you a question.",
        "LORELAI: I am a grown woman.",
        "RORY: Says the woman with the \"Hello, Kitty\" waffle iron.",
        "LORELAI: I have earned the right not to be quizzed about my social life by my sixteen-year-old daughter.",
        "RORY: I thought I was your best friend!",
        "LORELAI: When we're at a U2 concert, you are my best friend. But right now you are my sixteen-year-old daughter and I am telling you I do not want to have this conversation.",
        "RORY: Well I do.",
        "LORELAI: Well tough.",
        "RORY: Everything was planned! Everyone was excited, including you, and then all of a sudden, you're out!",
        "LORELAI: Well, I changed my mind.",
        "RORY: This is our life that you just tossed off!",
        "LORELAI: Hey, I didn't just toss off anything!",
        "RORY: We had plans! We made space in the closet!",
        "LORELAI: Oh Rory, just because we moved a couple of boxes is not reason enough for me to get married!",
        "RORY: Max was counting on this! I was counting on this!",
        "LORELAI: Rory, stop it! We are not gonna have this fight in a flowery bedroom with dentists singing \"Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves\" in the background. It's too David Lynch!",
        "RORY: I think you love him!",
        "LORELAI: Rory, go to sleep!",
        "RORY: I think you love him, and you got scared and you ran, but you're really going to regret it. And soon!",
        "LORELAI: Rory!",
        "RORY: Fine! [turns out light] Goodnight!",
        "[They both lay in the bed staring at the ceiling.]",
        "LORELAI: I'm sure. I wish I did love him. You have no idea how much.",
        "[Rory gives Lorelai a kiss on the cheek.]",
        "CUT TO ROOM 3",
        "[The next morning, Lorelai sits on a trunk at the edge of the bed as Rory walks out of the bathroom.]",
        "RORY: What's with the face?",
        "LORELAI: Hmm, they're taller.",
        "RORY: Not this again.",
        "LORELAI: There's more of them.",
        "RORY: Mom, the flowers on the wallpaper are not growing or reproducing.",
        "LORELAI: Hm.",
        "RORY: Wait a minute. You weren't writing in this thing, were you?",
        "LORELAI: Maybe some random thoughts.",
        "RORY: [reading guestbook] 'Satanic forces are at work here.' Mom.",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "RORY: What? What? We cannot write that in here. [changes it] Here. 'Sat and forever am at work here.'",
        "LORELAI: That doesn't make any sense.",
        "RORY: And it doesn't invoke the Dark Prince so I think it's preferable.",
        "LORELAI: Whatever.",
        "RORY: Hey?",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "RORY: Last night?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, we're good.",
        "RORY: Okay.",
        "LORELAI: You know what isn't good?",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: I ate the fuzzy Certs.",
        "RORY: Gross!",
        "LORELAI: They tasted like keys.",
        "RORY: Okay, enough. I have got to eat. Do you think the coast is clear downstairs?",
        "LORELAI: Let's check the schedule. Early morning nature walk, 7:30. Regional history talk, 8:15, bluppity blah bah bah bah. We're in luck. Breakfast just ended and the arts and crafts workshop doesn't begin for another thirteen minutes.",
        "RORY: We've got a window!",
        "LORELAI: It must be when they all shower.",
        "RORY: Grab your bag!",
        "LORELAI: Go go go!",
        "CUT TO DOWNSTAIRS",
        "[Lorelai and Rory walk down the steps thinking there's nobody around, but are suddenly stopped by LaDonn and some guests who are standing at a window.]",
        "LADONN: Hello strangers!",
        "RORY: Uh!",
        "LORELAI: Uhh, geez.",
        "LADONN: We've all been so worried about you two.",
        "LORELAI: What are you people doing?",
        "LADONN: We're watching hummingbirds.",
        "WOMAN: They're still out there if you wanna scooch in.",
        "MAN: They're the darndest things. Flap their wings a hundred times a second. It's an engineering marvel.",
        "LORELAI: That was not on the freaking list.",
        "LADONN: We don't put things like this on the freaking list, because the delights of nature aren't on any kind of time schedule.",
        "LORELAI: No, Lordy.",
        "WOMAN: So push in some chairs. We're gonna make some fresh scones.",
        "LADONN: Yeah, they're for tea this afternoon. I just brought out the first test batch. Have a taste.",
        "RORY: A taste would not be bad.",
        "LORELAI: Uh, maybe just a quick taste.",
        "[Lorelai and Rory both sit down and take a scone. The man and woman join them at the table.]",
        "WOMAN: So, LaDonn says you're in publishing.",
        "LORELAI: Huh?",
        "WOMAN: Publishing, you're in publishing?",
        "LORELAI: Oh yes, I am.",
        "MAN: Books, huh? You should find a field with less paperwork.",
        "LORELAI: Good one. [reaches for another scone]",
        "RORY: Mmm! Hey!",
        "LORELAI: You have two, I still have one!",
        "WOMAN: So, uh, publishing?",
