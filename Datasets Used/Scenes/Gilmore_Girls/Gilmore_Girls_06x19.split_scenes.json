        "AUNT JUN: I pack it very tightly. It strangles the spice.",
        "MRS KIM: Well, it's perfect, and we're doing very good on time.",

        "LANE: Boy, there's a lot of activity down here.",
        "MRS KIM: It's going very well. Your aunt Jun is a wizard with the Kimchi.",
        "LANE: Well, is there anything I can do to help?",
        "MRS KIM: No, go back upstairs. Read the bible passages I've underlined.",
        "LADIES: [In Koran] Juh gi in nae! Cham yeppuda. Aaenun unje gajil gueni?",

        "MRS KIM: You come down, cooking stops. [pointing upstairs] Up.",
        "LANE: But it's hot up there mama, and you know what rises with the hot air? The smell of 10 pounds of Kimchi. I'm getting woozy.",

        "LANE: I hope you made a matching blindfold so Zach doesn't have to actually see me in it.",
        "LORELAI: Now, come on. You're gonna look beautiful. You have a very pretty face, and you have hands and feet. For some guys, the stuff in between is just annoying.",
        "MRS KIM: [Sighs]",
        "LANE: Mama, are you okay?",
        "MRS KIM: Yes, fine. [Looking at Lorelai] What are you doing here?",

        "LORELAI: I was just about to show it to you.",
        "MRS KIM: Right. Go ahead.",
        "LORELAI: Um, now, there were a couple of stains on it, just probably from age, so I had to make a few minor adjustments, but I think you'll see, all in all, that the integrity of the dress has remained intact. [Lane is very please, Mrs Kim doesn't seen to care]",
        "MRS KIM: Fine. How much do I owe you?",
        "LORELAI: Uh, nothing. Um, consider it a wedding gift.",
        "MRS KIM: Okay, I have to go back to work. I will see you and Luke at the wedding.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, you will. I mean, you'll see me. Luke is out of town, but I'm gonna take pictures and make him feel really bad he missed it. It's a thing we do.",
        "MRS KIM: Whatever. Goodbye.",
        "LANE: Did she see it?",
        "LORELAI: I held it up right in front of her face.",
        "LANE: But she didn't yet, It's got a waist, and she didn't yell.",
        "LORELAI: Don't question it, take the dress upstairs and hide it till you're walking down the aisle. And even then, walk fast.",
        "LANE: Thank you.",
        "LORELAI: Okay.",
        "MRS KIM: [Yelling from the kitchen] Lorelai, wait! Come back! [Running out side] What do you mean Luke's out of town?!",
        "LORELAI: Uh, well, I mean, Luke's left town. He's gone far away from town. Town's there, and Luke's over here.",

        "LORELAI: Well, Rory will be there so...",
        "MRS KIM: No she won't like it",
        "LORELAI: Who won't?",
        "MRS KIM: You can't come alone. An unmarried woman of a certain age, unescorted, wearing the clothes you tend to wear, people will think things, bad things...",
        "LORELAI: Like what?",
        "MRS KIM: Like you're a tramp and possibly for sale.",
        "LORELAI: Wow, suddenly \"Footloose\" not seeming so silly.",
        "MRS KIM: What are we gonna do?",
        "LORELAI: Well I guess first of all we should agree on a price.",
        "MRS KIM: You have to find someone to bring you. You have to find a man!",

        "PARIS: When I first started writing, I believed passionately that tenure was a reward for excellent service and a way for a school to attract the very best teachers from all over the country.",
        "RORY: So let's go with that.",
        "PARIS: But once I finished writing I started thinking about the other side of the argument, I mean money and employment for the rest of your life? No matter what. Where is the incentive to keep the standards high? I mean Remember professor Leavers? He got tenured and lost all interest. Just sat there dowie and sleepy It was like being taught by Jimmy Kimmel.",
        "RORY: Anti-tenure, stamp it, ship it.",
        "PARIS: I was thinking you could print both pieces.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "PARIS: Side-by-side, like a point/counterpoint.",
        "RORY: You want me to print a point/counterpoint where both points are written by the same person?",
        "PARIS: Bold Huh.",

        "JULIET: We though we'd set up a fabulous camp, dress up like natives, in grass skirts and coconut bras and meet the boys with food, fresh booze, and shaving cream. What do you think.",
        "RORY: I think you should double-check your guidebooks, 'cause I don't think Costa Rican natives wear grass skirts and coconut bras.",
        "JULIET: Oh how cares there's only a small window of time where a girl can pull off a coconut bra.",
        "RORY: Well, thanks for the invite, but I can't.",

        "MICHEL: I'm just saying, tomorrow is a very special day. You need to be perfect.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, I'm not getting married, Michel.",
        "MICHEL: [A little laughing] I know that, but you are going to be with me, and I'm going to look fantastic, and you know that who you are with is always a reflection of yourself, and I don't want my reflection to look like Judy Garland, the mark Herron years.",
        "LORELAI: Michel stop. Now, I'm going to be wearing my blue pinstripes, so if you wear something in an ice blue or [Gasps] Oh, yes, silver, that would look amazing. No one would take their eyes off of us.",
        "LORELAI: And how delighted the bride will be.",
        "MICHEL: Now let's discuss dancing. As you know, I'm a fabulous dancer, Deney Terrio level and I intend to dance a lot. It's what I do at parties to compensate for the elevated calorie intake. I just shake it all off.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I promise to duck.",
        "MICHEL: I don't understand your attitude. After all, these are your friends. I don't even know them.",

        "LORELAI: [Looks at Michel, then to Chris] Yes, I have a minute.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: I just got Rory one of those Sidekicks. Actually I got it for her a couple of days ago, so she already has it. Then I realize that It's one of those things I should have run past you. So I'm running it past you now. Is that okay? 'Cause if it's not, I can take it back. I'll just say I read something in consumer reports about radiation levels.",
        "LORELAI: Chris, honey, we're way past the point where you have to get my permission to buy your own daughter a gift.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: We are.",

        "CHRISTOPHER: Exactly.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, come on. It's naptime.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Not until 4:00, my friend.",
        "LORELAI: Then she's holding her breath until you buy her a Porsche.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: She is in her room playing with her toys, shining her halo as we speak.",

        "LANE: My grandma's coming.",
        "RORY: Well Jeez, how big is she?",
        "LANE: She hasn't been out of Korea in 45 years because she refuses to travel, so we figured there's no way she'd come, but she called today, and she's coming.",
        "RORY: So that's nice right?",

        "LANE: Tell be about it I just discovered today that I am simply the latest link in a chain of Kim women who hide their real lives under floorboards away from their mothers.",

        "RORY: It's okay, Kyon. We were just leaving.",
        "KYON: [Starts stripping] I had to get out of house. Stinks of Kimchi and incense. You can't breath. There's Buddha's everywhere staring at you. [Notices Lane and Rory starring at her] What?",

        "LORELAI: Hmm, secret admirer?",
        "RORY: It's dad. He gave me this thing as a gift, you know. However, he also got himself one, and since then, he has been texting me every five minutes. It's insane you should have told him no when he ran this past you.",

        "LORELAI: All right, give me that. Um, okay. [texting] \"Your daughter is about to see Richard Gere's pen1s.\" That should shut him up for a while. [they notice one of the girls vomiting] That's got to be some sort of record.",

I will now share with you the contents of this letter. \"Dear Rory, how was your lunch? \"Mine was bad. Did you have ham again? \"If you did, I am sorry, but mine was worse. \"I thought you should know that today at recess \"I decided that I'm going to marry Alex Backus. \"He has a very nice head, \"and his ears don't stick out like Ronnie Winston's do. \"I will love him forever, no matter what.

I have known Lane forever, and I'm just so incredibly happy that she has gotten married. I mean, I am just so happy that this adorable 22-year-old girl has gotten married, because it's amazing, you know? It's really hard to get married. Believe me, I should know. [Rory looks on worried and looks to Chris, who is also worried.] I mean, seriously, because Lane is married, and next thing, it'll be my daughter, and then my granddaughter, but not me. I'm not getting married. No, it ain't for me. It's not in the cards. But, hey, do you know what date I'm not getting married? June 3rd. [Rory getting more worried] Do not save the date. Do you hear me? Do whatever you want on June 3rd, because there's nothing at all happening on that day. If there's anything you need to book or anything, it's totally safe to book it on June 3rd. [Chris gets up and goes to Rory] So, congratulations, Lane and Zach. Who else here had eight shots of Tequila? Anybody? Hands...no? Oh, my gosh, who misses the yummy bartenders? I know, me too. They were so great. I was gonna ask them to not work on June 3rd on my not wedding. I just thought that would be so fun. [Chris and Rory come on stage] Hi, Chris. Hi, Rory.",
