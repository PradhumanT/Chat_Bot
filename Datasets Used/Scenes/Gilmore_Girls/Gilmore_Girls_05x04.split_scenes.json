        "Lorelai confesses that part of the charm of breakfast by Luke is breakfast at Luke's; Rory is less than thrilled to discover that the common room in her suite has been overtaken by a huge antique printing press Paris inherited from Asher; Lorelai and Sookie head up Jackson's campaign committee when he decides to run against Taylor for town selectman to put an end to the grocer's petty tyranny over Stars Hollow, but Lorelai has second thoughts when she sees how Jackson's projected landslide victory is affecting Taylor; Rory and Dean have difficulty finding a comfortable place to be alone, compounded by Dean's having to share a car with Lindsay and his reluctance to make his relationship with Rory public; Lane confesses her true feelings to Zack; after all the votes have been counted, Jackson isn't quite certain he wants the job, and Taylor vows not to go away quietly."

        "OPEN IN LORELAI'S KITCHEN",
        "[Lorelai sleepily walks in and discovers Luke busily cooking at her stove.]",
        "LUKE: Hey, you're up.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, you're cooking.",
        "LUKE: Yep, making the works. Even threw a couple blintzes in there to confuse you.",
        "LORELAI: Wow. Where did all this come from?",
        "LUKE: What?",
        "LORELAI: The food, the pans, the bowls, the spatula.",
        "LUKE: Food's from Doose's, pans and bowls, you had, and the spatula's mine.",
        "LORELAI: You travel with a spatula? [pulls coffee mug out of nearby cabinet]",
        "LUKE: Sometimes.",
        "LORELAI: You've actually found yourself in scraping and flipping situations without the trusty spatula before?",
        "LUKE: [Unfazed, he continues stirring food in the pan.] Your coffee should be ready in a minute.",
        "LORELAI: [too bright smile] Smells good. Hey, Luke?",
        "LUKE: Yep?",
        "LORELAI: You cooking this is so sweet - .",
        "LUKE: [steels himself and rolls his eyes] But?",
        "LORELAI: I just figured, you know, we'd go to Luke's for breakfast.",
        "LUKE: Why?",
        "LORELAI: Because I like Luke's breakfast.",
        "LUKE: I am Luke.",
        "LORELAI: I know",
        "LUKE: This is the same stuff I make at the diner.",
        "LORELAI: I know.",
        "LUKE: So what's the difference?",
        "LORELAI: Well, the difference is, while you are Luke, we're not at Luke's.",
        "LUKE: So?",
        "LORELAI: Well, I have my things, you know? I have certain things. And one of my things is going to Luke's. And just because I now have \"Dating Luke\" doesn't mean I want to lose my \"Cooking Luke.\"",
        "LUKE: But I am cooking, and I am Luke.",
        "LORELAI: Look, it's like Tommy Lee having a Starbucks at his house.",
        "LUKE: [lost, but resumes cooking] What?",
        "LORELAI: On the surface, it sounds great. But half the reason you go to a Starbucks is to go to a Starbucks, you know, to go out and see the people.",
        "LUKE: Tommy Lee has a Starbucks in his house?",
        "LORELAI: \"Cribs,\" baby. Watch it.",
        "LUKE: Like a whole Starbucks with workers and everything?",
        "LORELAI: The point is that, while some things have changed -- and that's great -- I don't want everything to change completely.",
        "[ Telephone ringing nearby ]",
        "LUKE: [resigned] Okay. I'll see you at Luke's.",
        "[Luke turns off stove and begins cleaning up as Lorelai celebrates]",
        "LORELAI: Ah, I'll see you at Luke's! [picks up phone] Hello?",
        "CUT TO RORY'S DORM ROOM AT YALE",
        "[Rory scrambling around searching while talking on her phone. Scene switches between Yale and Lorelai's kitchen]",
        "RORY: \"Cultural Disenfranchisement with Women's Role Models\" -- do you have it?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, God, I hope not.",
        "RORY: It's the book for the class I'm officially late to.",
        "LORELAI: Oh.",
        "[Lorelai begins searching around the kitchen as Luke continues to clear table - putting cooked food in plastic storage containers then into a sack to bring to \"Luke's\".]",
        "LUKE: What are you looking for?",
        "LORELAI: A big, boring book.",
        "RORY: Who is that?",
        "LORELAI: It's Luke?",
        "LUKE: Who's that?",
        "LORELAI: It's Rory.",
        "RORY: Luke. It's pretty early in the morning for Luke to be there. Unless, perhaps, he woke up there.",
        "LORELAI: Well, he did.",
        "LUKE: \"He did\" what? Are you talking about me?",
        "RORY: Man, that's weird.",
        "LORELAI: What's weird?",
        "LUKE: Who's weird? I'm weird?",
        "RORY: The thought of Luke running around naked in my kitchen. It's weird.",
        "LORELAI: Luke is not running around naked in your kitchen. He is sitting at the table, and, yes, he is naked.",
        "LUKE: [cringes] Don't do that. Don't tell her I'm naked. I'm not naked. [calls out] I'm not naked!",
        "RORY: [teasing] He sounds naked.",
        "LORELAI: Well, the chairs are cold.",
        "RORY: Huh?",
        "LORELAI: He actually tried to make me breakfast.",
        "RORY: Really?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, naked.",
        "LUKE: [drops what he's doing and starts to leave] Okay, that's it, I'm gone.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, no, no, no. Sorry, don't, no. Rory, Luke is fully dressed. He never came in the house. He just stood outside all night playing \"In Your Eyes\" on a boom box.",
        "[Luke gapes and stares at the ceiling]",
        "RORY: I have to go. If you find the book, bring it to Friday-night dinner, okay? Go back to your dirtiness. [grabs her keys and exits]",
        "[Luke grins as Lorelai takes the paper sack from him.]",
        "CUT TO YALE - RORY AND PARIS' DORM ROOM",
        "[Rory enters as Paris watches movers leave a large wooden structure which dominates the main room. As they leave Paris calls after them.]",
        "PARIS: Thanks a lot. I photographed it before you moved it, so if there's any damage, you'll be hearing from my lawyer. [to Rory] Hi.",
        "RORY: Hi. Introduce me to your friend.",
        "PARIS: This is a Blou printing press, 18th century.",
        "RORY: And it's here because?",
        "PARIS: It's Asher's. He left it to me. It's beautiful, don't you think?",
        "RORY: Yeah. Think it goes great with the entire width of the room.",
        "PARIS: I know it's a little cumbersome, but we don't have to leave it right here. We could move it about six inches in any direction.",
        "RORY: Paris, we can't just leave it here.",
        "PARIS: I have nowhere else to put it.",
        "RORY: But -",
        "PARIS: You have to think of the benefits of having it here.",
        "RORY: Like?",
        "PARIS: No one else will have one, which means it's unique, which makes us unique. Kids our age do crazy things to make themselves unique -- piercings, blue hair, Kabbalah. It will be a great conversation piece. We'll be the talk of Branford.",
        "RORY: I believe we will.",
        "PARIS: We can print our own newsletter, if you'd like.",
        "RORY: [dryly] \"The Eccentric Gazette\". I love it.",
        "PARIS: It's from Asher. Just try it for a while. I promise if it gets in the way, we'll get rid of it.",
        "[Rory looks down and begins struggling to pull on a trapped object]",
        "RORY: Paris, it's on my book bag. I'm late for class, and you put a printing press on my book bag?",
        "[Rory unzips the bag and removes her books, stacking them in her arms]",
        "PARIS: Well, sorry. It's from my dead boyfriend, okay? I apologize if my grief is inconveniencing you. Maybe I'll just put myself on an iceberg and float myself out to sea so that no one will have to deal with my suffering.",
        "RORY: Well, just get that thing off my bag before you go.",
        "CUT TO DRAGONFLY INN - LIBRARY - STREWN WITH STACKS OF BOOKS AND CARDBOARD BOXES]",
        "[Michel enters, speaking on phone as Lorelai stocks shelves with books]",
        "MICHEL: [speaking on cordless phone] This is outrageous, and he will call me back and it had better be in a timely manner, or I will come down there and introduce myself, and, oh, the fun we'll have. Tst! [clicks off the phone and tosses it on the nearby chair] I hate this chair!",
        "LORELAI: What's the matter honey - Justin and Cameron having trouble again?",
        "MICHEL: I just got off the phone with the very promising young man working as Taylor's assistant to try and talk to the man about this. [hold out official looking papers]",
        "LORELAI: [approaches and take the papers] No, no. He rejected it again?",
        "MICHEL: I believe that is what the bright red letters say.",
        "LORELAI: We only need two lousy parking spaces. What is his problem?",
        "MICHEL: Oh, the list is long.",
        "LORELAI: This is the third time, Michel.",
        "MICHEL: I know.",
        "LORELAI: This is the third time that \"Bus-and-Truck-Tour Mussolini\" has rejected our permit.",
        "MICHEL: [dejected] And I was there for every show.",
        "LORELAI: What is rejection code \"M\"?",
        "[Michel takes the papers and checks the reverse side]",
        "MICHEL: \"Applicant's name does not match name listed on articles of incorporation.\"",
        "LORELAI: Ohh! Is he serious?!",
        "MICHEL: Apparently you did not put your middle name on this application. However, you did put your middle name on the articles of incorporation. So the names don't match, and Taylor has no idea who you are.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, I'm the person whose foot is going to prevent him from sitting down. That's who I am.",
        "MICHEL: You always promise to hurt him, but then you don't. You're a Taylor tease.",
        "LORELAI: I'm getting coffee.",
        "MICHEL: [grunts]",
        "CUT TO DRAGONFLY KITCHEN",
        "[Lorelai enters and makes a bee-line to the coffee machine. Sookie, Jackson and several kitchen staff crowd around a box of tomatoes. Jackson slices one of the red fruit.]",
        "SOOKIE: Ah, perfect timing! [waves her over]",
        "LORELAI: Oh, Sookie, I really need some coffee.",
        "SOOKIE: First this.",
        "LORELAI: But it's right over there, and -- okay, what am I looking at?",
        "SOOKIE: Jackson's tomatoes.",
        "JACKSON: [ceremoniously passes the cutting board for everyone to take a slice] Here we go.",
        "SOOKIE: Mmm. [Lorelai tries to slip away] Where are you going?",
        "LORELAI: I was just gonna get a little --",
        "SOOKIE: [hands Lorelai a big slice] Eat this. [Lorelai sighs and hurriedly takes a big bite] Isn't that the greatest tomato you've ever eaten?",
        "LORELAI: It's good.",
        "JACKSON: Good?",
        "LORELAI: It's great.",
        "JACKSON: Great?",
        "LORELAI: All I wanted was a cup of coffee.",
        "[Sookie instantly hands her a steaming cup] Oh, thank you. Sorry, Jackson. This is one rocking tomato.",
        "JACKSON: This is the first batch grown in my brand-new hydroponic greenhouse.",
        "SOOKIE: Jackson designed it himself.",
        "JACKSON: Built most of it myself, too.",
        "SOOKIE: You know what this means.",
        "JACKSON: The best tomatoes on the East coast, and in October.",
        "SOOKIE: Huh! October!",
        "LORELAI: Heh - It sure ain't November.",
        "JACKSON: This means year-round vegetables.",
        "SOOKIE: I am never gonna be a slave to Mother Nature again. If I wanna make it...",
        "JACKSON: Then I'm gonna grow it.",
        "LORELAI: [looks at them both] Aw, you two really found each other, didn't you?",
        "JACKSON: [sexy voice to Sookie] Do you want another piece of tomato?",
        "SOOKIE: Do I?",
        "[Lorelai walks off]",
        "JACKSON: [ Chuckling as he offers her another slice ]",
        "SOOKIE: [ Giggles as she takes a bite ] Boys, leave us, please. [ Giggles ]",

        "[Rory opens the door to reveal Dean standing there]",
        "DEAN: Hey.",
        "RORY: Hey. [they kiss as Paris glances over with curiosity] So, come on in. Dean, you remember Paris.",
        "DEAN: Yes, I do. Uh, how you doing, Paris?",
        "PARIS: I'm fine.",
        "DEAN: What's that?",
        "RORY: Uh, that's a printing press. Haven't you heard? Tats are out, movable type is in.",
        "DEAN: I've heard that.",
        "RORY: So, my room's in there.",
        "DEAN: Nice to see you again, Paris.",
        "PARIS: Right back at you.",
        "[Dean wanders back to Rory's room and shuts the door. Paris stops Rory.]",

        "RORY: He was -- now he's not.",
        "PARIS: Well, well -- Hoss returns. Who would've thunk?",
        "RORY: I'm going in my room now.",
        "PARIS: Just hold on. We have to figure this out.",
        "RORY: Figure what out?",
        "PARIS: You're going to be bringing boys home now. We need a system.",
        "RORY: I'm not bringing \"boys\" home. I'm bringing \"boy\" home. That boy - that's it.",
        "PARIS: I assume you're having s*x.",
        "RORY: [uncomfortable] Paris!",
        "PARIS: You're having s*x. Well, luckily, I just bought some noise-reducing headphones, so that'll help.",
        "RORY: Oh boy.",
        "PARIS: If I put the headphones on, then stuff towels under the door, that should do the trick.",
        "RORY: Hey, if you've got extra towels to stuff, I got a location suggestion.",
        "PARIS: How loud are you?",
        "RORY: Paris, stop.",
        "PARIS: Look, I don't care. I just need the information to formulate a good plan. I mean, you look all small and squeaky, but sometimes, it's exactly the bunny-looking girls who can blow the roof off the barn. I know, just give me a three-minute warning.",
        "RORY: I'm walking away now.",
        "PARIS: That way, I have time to put everything in place. Put headphones on, et cetera.",
        "RORY: Bye [backs away]",
        "PARIS: Is he gonna be coming over a lot? Probably, right? He's at his peak now, and it's probably one of the only things he's good at so...",

        "BRIAN: I'm just keeping track so we don't go over.",
        "ZACH: It's too much pressure. I can't think.",
        "BRIAN: If we use coupons, it would stretch our money.",
        "ZACH: Dude, the only thing more un-rock 'n' roll than coupons is that shirt you're wearing.",

        "LANE: I'm not sure why you need all that beer, that's all.",
        "ZACH: We've got gigs coming up, and I've kinda learned through experience that if you say to people, \"Hey, wanna come back for some beers?\" And you don't have beer, they get pissed and leave.",

        "ZACH: Right.",
        "LANE: Meaning \"girls.\"",

        "JACKSON: Hey, guys. How you doing?",

        "LANE: [to Zach] Any of your girlfriends need diapers?",

        "MAGGIE: I guess I could always go with canned. I hate canned.",
        "JACKSON: Hey, if you're needing more, Taylor, I got a nice crop of tomatoes. We could work something out.",
        "TAYLOR: Well, that's nice of you to offer. You're growing them in that big new greenhouse, right?",
        "JACKSON: [proudly] Built it with my own two hands.",

        "TAYLOR: Too bad about what's happening with all that.",

        "LANE: You know what I mean. I know -- I have no right to be bothered by Zach luring women back to the apartment with cheap beer, because I haven't told him I like him. I mean, if I had told him I like him and he was doing that, he'd be a creep of the first order. As it is, he's just exhibiting basic guy behavior -- grunt, grunt, caveman stuff, which, to be honest, is a bit of the appeal of Zach.",
