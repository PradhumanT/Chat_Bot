        "MISS PATTY: People please pay attention. Now, I want my before Mary over here, and my after Mary over here. Wise men, shepherd line up for the processional. I only have half a donkey? I need the rest of the donkey!",

        "KIRK: Ow!",
        "LORELAI: Hold still Kirk.",
        "KIRK: You stuck me.",
        "LORELAI: I did not stick you.",
        "KIRK: You did to.",

        "RORY: Um, Taylor, the baby Jesus is missing an arm again.",
        "TAYLOR: What?",
        "RORY: I was just getting it out of the trunk and -",
        "TAYLOR: Let me see that. Oh for Pete's sake! [to everyone] Ok listen up! The arm is missing! I repeat the arm is missing!",
        "RORY: Maybe it's just time to get a new baby Jesus, you know, one that's a boy.",
        "TAYLOR: It's a doll, no one can tell.",
        "RORY: Well it has a bow.",
        "TAYLOR: This has been the baby Jesus in every Christmas pageant since 1965. Were you here in 1965?",
        "RORY: No I wasn't.",
        "TAYLOR: Find the arm [Rory looks at Lorelai]",
        "LORELAI: What are you doing?",
        "KIRK: Nothing.",
        "LORELAI: You're flinching.",
        "KIRK: You stuck me once. There's nothing to say you won't do it again.",
        "LORELAI: Ok you know what? You're done.",
        "TAYLOR: Well?",
        "RORY: I swear, I've looked twice.",
        "TAYLOR: Look again.",
        "MISS PATTY: Taylor come quickly. Our \u0091before' Mary is about to become an \u0091after'. Who else in town is knocked up?",
        "[Lorelai and Rory look at each other awkwardly then look away. Pan to them leaving]",
        "LORELAI: Find the arm?",

        "[Lane runs up to her]",
        "LANE: Hey, I thought we were meeting at Luke's.",
        "RORY: We were? Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I forgot.",
        "LANE: Let me guess. You and Lorelai haven't made up yet?",
        "RORY: Nope. Things are still Miracle Worker at my house. God, how did everything get so screwed up?",
        "LANE: I think you staying out all night with Dean had something to do with it.",
        "RORY: And my grandmother being there to witness it didn't help.",
        "LANE: Never does.",
        "RORY: It sucks. Things were good. School was good, Dean was good. Now my mother and I are barely speaking. Mom and Grandma are barely speaking. Dean's new name is \u0091Narcolepsy boy'.",
        "LANE: How's he taking it?",
        "RORY: I don't know. I haven't talked to him since it happened.",

        "LANE: Good boy.",
        "RORY: Ok, I really need to talk about something else now.",
        "LANE: You went shopping.",
        "RORY: Yes I did. I got a mow-ing cow shaped timer for Sookie, some cardio-salsa tapes for Michel, a book for Dean -",
        "LANE: You got Dean a book?",
        "RORY: Yeah. \u0091Metamorphosis'.",
        "LANE: \u0091Metamorphosis.'",
        "RORY: It's Kafta.",
        "LANE: Very romantic.",
        "RORY: I think it is romantic.",
        "LANE: I know I've always dreamed that some day a guy would get me a really confusing Czechoslovakian novel.",
        "RORY: I think he'll appreciate it.",
        "LANE: A book sends the wrong message.",
        "RORY: What are you talking about?",
        "LANE: You have to look at what a gift says to the other person, not to you. Remember two years ago, I got my mom that perfume?",
        "RORY: Yeah.",
        "LANE: Ok, to me that said, \u0091Hey mom, you work hard, you deserve something fancy'. Now to my mother, it said \u0091Hey mom, here's some smelly s*x juice, the kind I use to lure boys with' and resulted in me being sent to Bible camp all summer.",
        "RORY: Yeah but -",
        "LANE: Just imaging that you actually gave Dean something really romantic, and he gave you a football. Your hypothetical romantic present is saying that you really, really like him. And his present is saying \u0091Hey man, let's just be friends'.",
        "RORY: And you're saying that this book is -",
        "LORELAI: Is a Czechoslovakian football, yes.",
        "RORY: So then what do I get him?",
        "LANE: What you should do is find out what he's getting you and gauge your gift accordingly.",
        "RORY: But doesn't that kinda take the fun out of it?",
        "LANE: Gift giving is serious business. If you don't believe me try spending a month at Korean Bible camp.",

        "MICHEL: Yes right there. Now flip the elf and the fairy.",
        "GUY: Which one is the fairy?",
        "MICHEL: The one with the wand [Guy goes for one] What are you doing?",
        "GUY: Isn't this a wand?",
        "MICHEL: No, that is a staff.",
        "GUY: So this isn't a fairy?",
        "MICHEL: That is Little Bo Peep.",
        "GUY: And you don't want to move her.",
        "MICHEL: I would prefer that you didn't.",

        "LORELAI: Well mom, there's been a lot going on around here lately, your Christmas shindig's not exactly high on my list of things to obsess about.",
        "EMILY: Well I'm sorry if the timing is bad Lorelai, but the world doesn't always revolve around you.",
        "LORELAI: Well thanks for the tip.",
        "EMILY: Cocktails are at 6, dinner's at 8.",
        "LORELAI: I probably won't be there for cocktails.",
        "EMILY: Why not?",
        "LORELAI: Because I have to work.",
        "EMILY: You can't leave work early?",
        "LORELAI: No I can't.",
        "EMILY: Why not?",
        "LORELAI: Because it's not in my job description.",
        "EMILY: Well then don't come.",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "EMILY: Don't come. It's obviously an enormous burden for you.",

        "EMILY: Lorelai let's be honest here, I'm not too happy with you right now and I assume you're not too happy with me.",
        "LORELAI: My polka dot dress matched my face and still I had to sit through 12 courses.",
        "EMILY: I am tired of forcing you to do all those terrible things that infringe upon your life and I do not have the energy to pretend that the way you treated my the other day was in any way acceptable.",
        "LORELAI: So you're uninviting me to Christmas dinner?",
        "EMILY: Yes I am.",
        "LORELAI: Fine.",
        "EMILY: Fine.",
        "LORELAI: Ok, anything else?",
        "EMILY: I believe that's all.",
        "LORELAI: Ok well, great mom, it's been swell talking to you.",

        "LORELAI: It's not my mind that needs to be changed.",
        "RORY: I don't think she meant it.",
        "LORELAI: Oh she meant it.",
        "RORY: Well maybe she thinks she meant it at the time, but I bet she won't mean it later when I show up there without you.",
        "LORELAI: And without a map to follow that reasoning I say, \u0091Take a hot it's cold outside'.",
        "RORY: You just wanna hold a grudge.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, it burns more calories.",

        "RORY: Ok.",
        "LORELAI: I don't remember the country club organizing a Tae-bo class.",
        "RORY: Fine, forget it. Should I put your name on Grandma's present?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, sign it the inn keeper formally known as her daughter.",
        "RORY: You know what I think?",
        "LORELAI: What?",

        "RICHARD: Ah. Speaking of which, I'm going to give that man a call.",
        "ALAN: Richard, you're getting yourself all worked up.",
        "RICHARD: As long as I've been with this company, it has been run by gentleman. Revising a man's work without so much as a phone call would've been unheard of!",
        "ALAN: It's a new world out there Richard.",
        "RICHARD: Oh!",
        "EMILY: Please stop all this shop talk. We are here to celebrate.",

Now was it a fairly new van? Great, ok, well Joe, as with most tragedies in life there come a time when you just need to pick up and move one. So what's the next phase of the delivery saga? Mm-hmm...Well how long until your brother's back with the razor scooter? Ok, uh-huh, alright, just call me when it gets there. Bye Joe.",

        "DEAN: Please just tell me where I stand.",

        "LORELAI: I don't hate you.",
        "DEAN: No?",
        "LORELAI: No. Though I did imagine 20 different ways to remove your head from your body.",
