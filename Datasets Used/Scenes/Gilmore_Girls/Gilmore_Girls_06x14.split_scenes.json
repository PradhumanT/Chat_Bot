        "LORELAI: The roses are amazing, mom.",
        "EMILY: Thank you, Lorelai.",
        "RORY: I like them, too, grandma.",
        "EMILY: Thank you, Rory.",
        "RICHARD: You are an expert flower arranger, Emily. Perhaps you missed your calling.",
        "EMILY: Thank you, Richard.",
        "LORELAI: Well done, everyone. Well done.",
        "EMILY: Oh, stop it, Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: What, I'm just commenting on how nice and civil that moment was. Never mind. Go on, go on. [Smiling] That was so cute.",
        "RORY: [After a moment] The roses are nice, grandma.",
        "LORELAI: [A little annoyed] Already covered that. Move on.",
        "RICHARD: So, Rory, how are things going at Yale?",
        "RORY: They're fine.",
        "EMILY: I didn't know we were allowed to talk about Yale.",
        "LORELAI: Mom",
        "RICHARD: Oh No. We're allowed to talk about it. We're just not allowed to pay for it.",
        "LORELAI: Dad",
        "EMILY: I wonder if we're allowed to visit it.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, hold on.",
        "RICHARD: Perhaps if we dress in disguise.",
        "LORELAI: Guys!",
        "EMILY: Plastic nose with glasses attached.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, come on. We were doing so well there for a while. Then you had to start with the Yale.",
        "EMILY: So we can't talk about Yale.",
        "RICHARD: I should make a list. What else am I not allowed to discuss in my house?",
        "LORELAI: No, of course you can talk about Yale. Yale is dad's alma mater, and Rory goes there, so we have to talk about it, okay? But maybe not now.",
        "EMILY: Fine.",
        "RICHARD: Fine with me.",
        "LORELAI: Now, I know a lot of stuff has happened, but we all agreed we were gonna put all that behind us and just move on, okay? So let's take a step back and, uh, start again. And 5, 4, 3, 2... these roses are amazing, mom.",
        "EMILY: Thank you, Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: That-a-girl.",
        "RICHARD: Your mother has a way with flowers. Perhaps she missed her calling.",
        "LORELAI: Okay Dad, we don't have to have exactly the same conversation we just had.",
        "RICHARD: How am I supposed to know? You said the same thing you said.",
        "LORELAI: I was getting the ball rolling.",
        "RICHARD: Lorelai, this is my house. I should have some control over what goes on here [Raising his voice] at some point!",
        "EMILY: You're raising your voice again, Richard.",
        "RICHARD: I am not!",
        "EMILY: You are, and you're raising your voice to me.",
        "RICHARD: I'm not allowed to [Looking at Rory] raise it to the people who deserve it.",
        "LORELAI: 5, 4, 3, 2...",
        "RICHARD: I love shrimp! Who else loves shrimp?!",
        "RORY: Me!",
        "LORELAI: I'm a fan!",
        "RICHARD: This is ridiculous.",
        "EMILY: Lorelai, how's Luke?",
        "LORELAI: Hey, nice one, mom.",
        "EMILY: Thank you. [Moment] Well?",
        "LORELAI: What? Oh. Oh, he's fine.",
        "EMILY: So you're still engaged.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, we're still engaged.",
        "EMILY: I was just asking. After all, I haven't gotten a \"save the date\" card yet. If you're engaged, I assume you're planning a wedding at some point, not that I've heard anything.",
        "LORELAI: I will send you a \"save the date\" card, mom.",
        "EMILY: For?",
        "LORELAI: For?",
        "EMILY: What date am I saving?",
        "LORELAI: Dur, well if I tell you that now, then what fun will the card be?",
        "EMILY: I mean, I assume I'm invited. I haven't heard. I haven't heard if I'm invited, if I'm in the wedding, if I need a dress. And now you won't tell me the date of this wedding that I may or may not be invited to.",
        "LORELAI: June 3rd!",
        "EMILY: June 3rd?",
        "LORELAI: Yes, June 3rd, okay?",
        "EMILY: Are we here June 3rd?",
        "RICHARD: I believe we are.",
        "EMILY: All right. June 3rd. That's very soon.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah.",
        "EMILY: Is there any specific reason so soon?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, boy.",
        "EMILY: June 3rd. June 3rd? Richard, June 3rd.",
        "RICHARD: Yes, June 3rd.",
        "EMILY: Well, it's just so soon. I mean, we haven't even seen Luke since... Richard, when was the last time we saw Luke?",
        "RICHARD: It's been a while.",
        "EMILY: A long while. Well, you must bring him to dinner Friday.",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "EMILY: The next time we see him certainly cannot be as you're walking down the aisle.",
        "LORELAI: Well, there's time before...",
        "EMILY: No, there's not. Your father goes out of town every other week from now until the end of may, I have functions every weekend, two charity balls, the zoo auction, the Hartford beautification project. Your father and I bought a stretch of the highway.",
        "RICHARD: Exit 36 through 38.",
        "EMILY: So there's literally no time left. It has to be Friday.",
        "RICHARD: Friday it is.",
        "LORELAI: I don't know if Luke is available Friday.",
        "EMILY: Well tell him he has to be. This is family.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, but...",
        "EMILY: He would say no to having dinner with his future mother and father-in-law? Is this really the kind of man you want in your life? Is this really the kind of man you want to be Rory's stepfather?",
        "RORY: Yeah, think of the kids.",
        "LORELAI: Luke is not saying no.",
        "EMILY: You are?",
        "LORELAI: No, I'm not saying no, either.",
        "EMILY: So no one's saying no.",
        "LORELAI: Right.",
        "EMILY: So you're saying yes.",
        "LORELAI: Yes.",
        "EMILY: Good. I'll pick up some \"save the date\" cards tomorrow. Do you want a color? Because I think white is the best choice.",

        "KITCHEN OF LOREAI (AND LUKE'S) HOUSE",
        "[Lorelai is putting frozen food on trays]",
        "LORELAI: Hey, have you noticed that anything in a red-wine reduction sauce leaves you hungry 20 minutes later?",
        "RORY: [OS] Especially if you don't eat it.",
        "LORELAI: Did my parents eat exceptionally slowly tonight?",
        "RORY: [OS] Yes.",
        "LORELAI: They did. My mother started on the white-meat portion of her game hen at 8:15 and did not hit the drumstick till 10 O' nine.",
        "RORY: [OS] Actually 9:15.",
        "LORELAI: You've been in there an hour. What are you doing?",
        "RORY: [OS] Facial exercises. The younger I look, the younger you look.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, good point. Hey, do we want the apple turnovers or the cherry?",
        "RORY: [OS] Yes. [Moment] Hey, question, where did June 3rd come from?",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "RORY: [OS] I thought there was no June 3rd.",
        "LORELAI: No, there's a June 3rd. Just because we don't get married on a date doesn't make it cease to exist.",
        "RORY: [OS] You know what I mean.",
        "LORELAI: I was on the spot. I just didn't want to go through the whole \"the wedding was postponed\" explanation.",
        "RORY: [OS] Why not?",
        "LORELAI: Because that would lead to the \"what happened?\" Conversation, which would lead to the \"I told you so\" conversation and the \"what is wrong with you that you can't close the deal?\" Conversation, which would lead to the \"why is Lorelai slamming her head against the wall?\" Conversation. So I just said June 3rd. It could still happen, and if it doesn't, I'll blow up that bridge when we come to it.",
        "[Rory comes out of her room]",
        "RORY: I get it.",
        "LORELAI: Thank you. Those new sweats?",
        "RORY: Yep, just came out.",
        "LORELAI: Did you get some for mommy?",
        "RORY: You want some Yale sweats?",
        "LORELAI: No, no, not me, your other mommy, the one who raised you and fed you and stayed up with you when you had the measles.",
        "RORY: I already put them in your room.",
        "LORELAI: Excellent! [Handing Rory a pop-tart] To cleanse your palate.",
        "RORY: Thank you.",
        "LORELAI: Let's go.",
        "[They go into the living room and sit on the couch and turn on the TV]",
        "LORELAI: Hey, you know who also might like a sweatshirt?",
        "RORY: They don't make them for dogs. I already asked.",
        "LORELAI: I did not mean Paul Anka. He's a Princeton man, anyhow.",
        "RORY: Nice loyalty.",
        "LORELAI: I think Christopher might like one.",
        "RORY: Dad? Really?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, he's paying your tuition now. It might be a nice gesture.",
        "RORY: Yeah, sure, I could do that.",
        "LORELAI: Cool. \"Solaris\"?",
        "RORY: No, not again.",
        "LORELAI: I'm telling you, there's a story in there somewhere.",
        "RORY: Yeah, the story is you calling yourself Mrs. Clooney for 2 1/2 hours.",
        "LORELAI: Have you heard from him lately?",
        "RORY: George? Yes, last night. The Oscar buzz is really getting to him.",
        "LORELAI: I'm talking about your dad.",
        "RORY: No.",
        "LORELAI: Huh.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: Nothing. He's just been very quiet lately.",
        "RORY: So?",
        "LORELAI: So it's weird. Pops up and then disappears again, that's never good.",
        "RORY: Unless he's a groundhog. Maybe dad's a groundhog.",
        "LORELAI: I wonder what he's up to.",
        "RORY: Maybe he's just busy with work.",
        "LORELAI: No, I don't buy it.",
        "RORY: Well maybe he's just doing what he promised he would do.",
        "LORELAI: What's that?",
        "RORY: He's putting up the money and staying out of everything else.",
        "LORELAI: Hmm. Well, that was the agreement, wasn't it?",
        "RORY: Yes, it was.",
        "LORELAI: Huh. Maybe he is just doing what we agreed to. So un-Christopher of him.",
        "RORY: People change, and then they get a nice sweatshirt as a treat.",
        "LORELAI: Good for him.",
        "RORY: Yep. Hey, \"Bullets over Broadway.\"",
        "LORELAI: \"Don't speak.\"",
        "RORY: If only.",
        "LORELAI: [Gasps] Hey, you like me. Remember that.",
        "RORY: Hmm.",
        "LORELAI: Why don't you invite him to Yale for lunch, show him around the campus, make him feel daddy-ish?",
        "RORY: You think he'd like that?",
        "LORELAI: I think he'd love that.",
        "RORY: Okay. I'll call him tomorrow.",
        "LORELAI: Just don't take him to the library.",
        "RORY: Mom.",
        "LORELAI: Don't show him all your classes. Don't make him touch the toe.",
        "RORY: This is my tour.",
        "LORELAI: I'm just saying, if he passes out from boredom, he's gonna be a lot harder to drag around campus than I was.",
        "RORY: Seriously, don't speak.",
        "YALE NEWSPAPER ROOM",
        "[The staff are gathered around]",
        "SHEILA: This is getting ridiculous.",
        "BILL: Well I'm completely out of ideas.",
        "SHEILA: How about we call her cell phone and make up some kind of emergency? Would that work?",
        "[Rory enter the room]",
        "RORY: Okay, hit me with it.",
        "AK: Big shock, it's about Paris.",
        "RORY: What did she do now?",
        "BILL: Nothing, it's what's been done to her.",
        "JONI: The Howell Raines-ing is complete.",
        "RORY: She's out?",
        "BILL: The board has spoken.",
        "JONI: More like screamed.",
        "RORY: Oh, boy. How did she take it?",
        "SHEILA: She hasn't.",
        "JONI: She won't come out of her bunker.",
        "AK: She's been in there for hours.",
        "BILL: Even Hitler came out every once in a while to walk his dog.",
        "JONI: I interrupted her highness while she was on the phone and got a 5,000-word lecture on Robert's rules of order.",
        "RORY: Well, she's got to be told.",
        "AK: Then she's got to come out.",
        "JONI: Tear gas! Where can we find tear gas?",
        "SHEILA: Or we could set off the fire alarm.",
        "RORY: Stand down, everyone. I'll tell her.",
        "BILL: Really?",
        "RORY: It's probably better that the person delivering the news doesn't chuckle with glee while doing it, Bill.",
        "BILL: [Chuckling] I would not chuckle while doing it. Oh, my god, that was completely inadvertent.",
        "RORY: All right, I'm going in.",
        "[Inside Paris's bunker, Paris sitting with her feet on the chair and her legs tucked up to her chest, she is on the phone.]",
        "PARIS: I know, Mr. Weisner. It was a complete screw-up. Here's what happened, your ad ran with the phone number of the beauty-supply-store ad from the next page. That's why you're getting calls about hair gel and moisturizers. Anyway, I really want you to rest easy, and I hope this does not interfere with any financial contributions that you've been generous enough to promise. All right? Thank you. Bye. [Hangs up phone] This job is 24/7.",
        "RORY: Yeah.",
        "PARIS: It's not enough to put out a daily paper with outstanding quality, without having to dodge complaints from uppity alumni calling over every little mistake. Weisner threatened to withhold money he had already pledged for the new computers because his ad was messed up. I mean can he even do that?",
        "RORY: I don't know.",
        "PARIS: [Moving to a hot plate] Do you want some soup? I was just heating up some soup.",
        "RORY: There's no ventilation in here.",
        "PARIS: I'm careful.",
        "RORY: Right. Uh, well, no, thank you. I just came in here to... I was just thinking...",
        "PARIS: yeah?",
        "RORY: [Sighs] Five-plus years?",
        "PARIS: Hmm.",
        "RORY: That we've known each other, that we've been friends. Five-plus.",
        "PARIS: That long? Wow.",
        "RORY: Feels like forever ago to me, Chilton, the day we met, just a couple of rosy-cheeked kids.",
        "PARIS: My face inflamed easily back then, too many tomatoes and red peppers.",
        "RORY: Got off to kind of a rocky start. We were competitors.",
        "PARIS: I get that from my mother. She's part Viking.",
        "RORY: But eventually we became pals, good pals, because we respected each other and supported each other in good times and bad.",
        "PARIS: Did I open this can today or yesterday?",
        "RORY: This is a not-so-good time, Paris.",
        "PARIS: I know. If the hurricanes don't kill us, the bird flu will.",
        "RORY: I mean for you, here, at the paper. [Paris looks at Rory] The board voted you out.",
        "PARIS: Oh...I see. [Moves away from the hotplate and soup] So it's over.",
        "RORY: I'm sorry. I just found out. I'm so sorry.",
        "PARIS: Well, it's not like I didn't have a clue that that was a possibility.",
        "RORY: It has been pretty tense around here.",
        "PARIS: So, are they all out there excitedly awaiting my perp walk?",
        "RORY: Oh, who cares? Who cares about them? You don't perp walk. You're Paris Geller. You walk tall. You're better than all of them.",
        "PARIS: Really?",
        "RORY: Definitely. And this job, Paris, being editor, you don't need this, this hassle. You're gonna be a doctor.",
        "PARIS: Surgeon.",
        "RORY: And a lawyer.",
        "PARIS: Judge.",
        "RORY: That's a hell of a workload. And the workload here, the indignities, smoothing the ruffled feathers of advertisers, covering sports as if they matter, you're exhausted, Paris, stretched thin, eating soup out of a can.",
        "PARIS: Soup I don't even like.",
        "RORY: This might not be such a bad thing, leaving this job, huh?",
        "PARIS: I am pretty tired.",
        "RORY: You even look a little relieved.",
        "PARIS: And I'll be damned if I'm gonna give those people a perp walk.",
        "RORY: Good. Good attitude.",
        "PARIS: Let's get out of this spider hole and take care of this right now.",
        "RORY: I am with you, friend. You better shut off the hot plate.",
        "PARIS: Right.",
        "[Back in the newsroom]",
        "PARIS: Everyone, I have a little announcement, so if you could gather around, please. We have an issue. You see, it has become increasingly apparent that I have become the story here at the Yale daily news and that I have overshadowed our journalistic efforts. Well, I don't want to be the story at my own newspaper, because then I'd be Judith Miller, and I'd have to wear my bangs too long and overdo my lipstick, and I don't want that. I want to remain me. So I am tendering my resignation as editor in chief effective immediately. In closing, I'd like to state that the Yale daily news has overcome numerous obstacles in its august history and that it will easily overcome this. My resignation will be a loss, but it will be a loss the daily news can survive, and it is a loss it must survive. Good night and good luck.",
        "[Paris leaves the newsroom. Bill moves the Paris name of the location board Paris set up. Cheers and applause, as Rory looks on with concern]",

        "LUKE: [Sighs] I don't want to go.",
        "LORELAI: Of course you don't.",
        "LUKE: Your parents are not warm people.",
        "LORELAI: They were extras in \"March of the penguins.\"",
        "LUKE: Maybe we could skip the drinks, have the dinner, and be done.",
        "LORELAI: Skip the drinks! Luke, you don't skip the one activity that makes the rest of the evening miraculously tolerable. The drinks fortify us. The drinks give us strength. The drinks get us drunk.",
        "LUKE: But they take forever, and then I got to sit there and talk to your dad about stocks and literature and watch it dawn on him for the umpteenth time that I don't know anything about stocks or literature. How many times can two people have the same awful conversation?",
        "LORELAI: Just repeat after me, \"this is really great scotch, Richard.\"",
        "LUKE: And then, of course, there's your mother, who hates me.",
        "LORELAI: All the more reason to get a little soused.",
        "LUKE: We can drink in the car.",
        "LORELAI: One of us has to drive.",
        "LUKE: Fine, you drink in the car, I'll take five quick shots in their driveway.",
        "LORELAI: Look, I want to get out of there as quickly as you do, but we have to think a little more pragmatically. So when the dessert comes, I will fake an attack of food poisoning, and then you rush me to the car.",
        "LUKE: That's your solution?",
        "LORELAI: Uh-huh, yes. Fake stomach pain is my specialty, that and getting my fianc\u00e9 to agree to horrible things he hates.",
        "LUKE: 6 O'clock?",
        "LORELAI: Wear something fetching.",
        "[Lorelai walks toward the dinning room]",
        "MICHEL: What is Luke doing here?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, he's making a few minor repairs around the inn.",
        "MICHEL: What about the handyman?",
        "LORELAI: Parker?",
        "MICHEL: Yes. I thought we liked him.",
        "LORELAI: We do, but Luke offered, and he has his own tool belt, and the price was right.",
        "MICHEL: Oh, really? No charge?",
        "LORELAI: No, well, I did have to give him a coupon for 100 free snuggles.",
        "MICHEL: How adorable.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, and to tell the truth, parker always kind of turned up his nose at my snuggle bucks.",
        "MICHEL: So I guess this is how we're operating now.",
        "LORELAI: How's that?",
        "MICHEL: We've dispensed with hiring professionals around here. Maybe from now on, my cousin Gert can do our accounting. She's got her own calculator.",
        "LORELAI: He's not performing open-heart surgery, Michel. He's just fixing a few things, for free, saving me a little money so I can do crazy things like pay people's salary and heat the place.",
        "MICHEL: Well, he's not doing a very good job. That key rack is protruding way too far out. It's going to wreak havoc on my French cuffs every time I reach for a key.",
        "LORELAI: Tell him how you like the hooks.",
        "MICHEL: Oh, I'm supposed to just follow him around all day, correcting his every mistake? Absurd. We will sit down and make a detailed list of everything we need done, and he can consult that.",
        "LORELAI: Luke does not need a list.",
        "MICHEL: What do you mean? We always gave parker a list.",
        "LORELAI: Luke's got a sixth sense about these things. He can spot a loose screw from across the room. He can sense when something needs to be fixed before it's even broken, it's spooky.",
        "MICHEL: Well, I will do a quick walk-through with him, just to make sure his magical powers are working.",
