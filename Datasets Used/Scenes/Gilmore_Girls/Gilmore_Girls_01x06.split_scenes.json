    "Recap": [
        "It's Rory's sixteenth birthday, so Emily and Lorelai each plan a party representative of their respective styles. Emily makes an effort to better understand Rory, much to Lorelai's delight. However, Emily invites all of Rory's Chilton classmates without consulting Rory. The resulting cold party atmosphere so upsets Rory that she argues with Emily. To make peace, Emily and Richard attend Lorelai's informal bash the next evening. They are caught off-guard by the colorful party guests. Emily tours the house, as she and Richard have never visited before, and learns Lorelai broke her leg three years ago and never told her parents. Emily sadly realizes she doesn't know her daughter at all. Dean gives Rory a birthday present."

        "LORELAI: So where'd you say Dad was?",
        "EMILY: Away on business.",
        "LORELAI: Location's top secret?",
        "EMILY: Oh, Germany.",
        "LORELAI: Germany. Is Dad's firm insuring Nazis now?",
        "EMILY: Your father doesn't know any Nazis.",
        "LORELAI: I know, Mom. I was just --",
        "EMILY: What?",
        "RORY: Joking. She was joking.",
        "EMILY: Oh. Hard to tell.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, well.",
        "EMILY: Oh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Claudia died.",
        "LORELAI: Who?",
        "EMILY: Claudia. Your cousin Claudia. (Lorelai stares.) Claudia!",
        "LORELAI: I'm hearing the name, Mom. I have no idea who that is.",
        "EMILY: Claudia's your cousin, for all intents and purposes.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, now we're getting to it.",
        "EMILY: She was your father's grandmother's sister's girl. So to you, that would make her --",
        "LORELAI: Nothing?",
        "EMILY: Regardless the funeral's on Thursday. I thought we'd all go together.",
        "LORELAI: Ooh, whoa. Two problems. Impossible to get away from the inn Thursday. Two, I've never met this woman.",
        "EMILY: You most certainly have.",
        "LORELAI: When?",
        "EMILY: Several times.",
        "LORELAI: I'll take one.",
        "EMILY: We went to her house in Groton to see the first moon landing. She'd just gotten a new Philco.",
        "LORELAI: I have no memory of this whatsoever.",
        "EMILY: Rory, correct me if I'm wrong, but men have walked on the moon regardless of whether your mother remembers it or not.",
        "RORY: That's the rumor.",
        "LORELAI: I know men have walked on the moon. I just don't know Claudia.",
        "EMILY: So you're not going?",
        "LORELAI: Not this time.",
        "EMILY: I don't think Claudia's planning to die a second time.",
        "LORELAI: Mom, I couldn't go if I wanted to.",
        "EMILY: Fine. (pauses) Oh wait -- Rudolph Gottfried.",
        "LORELAI: Another cousin?",
        "EMILY: No, a Nazi that we knew. I'd forgotten. We stayed with him once in Munich. Nice old man. Interesting stories.",
        "LORELAI: Mom you socialized with a Nazi? That's despicable! That's heinous!",
        "EMILY: No, dear, that was a joke.",
        "(Rory laughs.)",
        "(Cut to Lorelai's kitchen. It is morning and Lorelai is seated at the table drinking coffee. Rory walks into the kitchen and closes her bedroom door on loud music.)",
        "LORELAI: Hey. I have an idea for a new reality show. How about everyone just looks out their freakin' kitchen window for a change?",
        "RORY: Ooh. She's cranky this morning.",
        "LORELAI: Let's just say the world has a formidable opponent.",
        "RORY: Wait -- shouldn't you be baking?",
        "LORELAI: I don't know. Shouldn't you be knitting?",
        "RORY: Mom! The Chilton bake sale is today!",
        "LORELAI: I know. I got it covered.",
        "RORY: They expect the things to be homemade.",
        "LORELAI: I know.",
        "RORY: By someone other than Dolly Madison.",
        "LORELAI: I said I have it covered.",
        "RORY: All of the parents pitch in so this is really really important. You know that, right?",
        "LORELAI: No, I didn't know that. In that case I don't have it covered. I have it covered! Get your stuff and hit the stereo -- we're late.",
        "RORY: (softly) It's not me.",
        "(Rory opens her door and we see Lane dancing in the room.)",
        "LORELAI: (to Lane) Where does your mother think you are?",
        "(Lane turns off the music.)",
        "LANE: Oh, on a park bench contemplating the reunification of the two Koreas.",
        "LORELAI: Not here, skanking to Rancid?",
        "LANE: Wouldn't be included.",
        "LORELAI: School!",
        "(Cut to exterior of the house. Lane, Lorelai, and Rory walk down the front steps and start to cross the yard. Lane waves as she runs off.)",
        "LANE: Bye.",
        "RORY: Bye.",
        "(Babette and Morey walk by. Morey is pulling a wagon with Cinnamon -- their cat --inside. The wagon has a covering like a baby carriage.)",
        "RORY: Wow, Cinnamon, riding in style.",
        "BABETTE: Yeah, Morey made it. Cinnamon's not walking good these days but she still likes her passeggiatas. That's Italian for 'a nice walk.'",
        "MOREY: (with an accent) Passeggiata.",
        "BABETTE: Oh God, he makes it sound so sexy.",
        "MOREY: Come on.",
        "LORELAI: (points to the covered area) What's that?",
        "BABETTE: Oh it's Cinnamon's private area. Sometimes she likes to be alone. She's just like Morey in that sense. (to Morey) Hey, say passaggiata again.",
        "MOREY: I can't do it on command, Babs.",
        "BABETTE: Oh, he's blushin'. God, I love a man that blushes!",
        "(BABETTE and MOREY walk away, pulling the wagon.)",
        "RORY: Okay, our town is just weird.",
        "LORELAI: Thank God.",
        "RORY: Bye.",
        "LORELAI: Bye.",
        "RORY: I'll see you later at school.",
        "LORELAI: For what?",
        "RORY: Mom, the bake sale!",
        "LORELAI: Ha! I got the vein in the forehead. Whoo!",
        "RORY: Sadist.",
        "(Cut to a busy street. People are walking by on the sidewalk. Rory is sitting on a bench. A bus pulls around the corner and stops in front of her. Dean is walking down the street and sees Rory get on the bus. He gets on and sits behind her. Rory opens her book and beings to read. She doesn't notice him.)",
        "DEAN: Hey.",
        "RORY: Aah! Morning.",
        "DEAN: Good book?",
        "RORY: I don't know yet.",
        "DEAN: I saw you standing in line so I thought I'd say hello. (pause) Hello?",
        "RORY: Hello.",
        "DEAN: Oh, hey, uh, thanks for helping me get the job at the store. I mean it's not a career or anything but it's got me solvent.",
        "RORY: Solvent's good.",
        "DEAN: Yeah, uh, are you always this serious?",
        "RORY: No.",
        "DEAN: So, uh, how long does it take you to get to school?",
        "RORY: Um...forty minutes if the bus driver's focused but longer if he's trying to win something on the radio. Hey, this bus is going to Hartford!",
        "DEAN: Yeah, I know.",
        "RORY: But you go to school here. You have to get off the bus! (calls to driver) Hey, he has to get off the bus!",
        "DEAN: Wait. You're forgetting something.",
        "(Bus stops.)",
        "DEAN: Buses make stops. Good-bye Lorelai Gilmore.",
        "(Dean gets off the bus.)",
        "(Cut to the inn where Michel is on the phone.)",
        "MICHEL: Independence Inn, Michel speaking. Yes, you are confirmed. Mm-hmm. Goodbye.",
        "(Michel hangs up the phone as a group of businessmen approach the counter.)",
        "MAN: Bonjour Monsieur. Vous \u00eates francais? Vous parlez francais?",
        "MICHEL: No, sorry.",
        "MAN: Parlez vous fracais?",
        "MICHEL: Sir, I'm just a simple country boy from Texas. I do not understand this francais business you're babbling about.",
        "LORELAI: Pardon",
        "(Lorelai pulls Michel aside.)",
        "LORELAI: He knows you're not from Texas.",
        "MICHEL: Smile when you say that.",
        "LORELAI: Michel, I told you there was going to be a French group here for a couple of days and it is your job to keep them happy.",
        "MICHEL: Lorelai, I don't know how many French people you've met over the years, but most of them are insufferable.",
        "LORELAI: Really?",
        "MICHEL: Mm-hm. That is why I left France.",
        "LORELAI: Huh. I thought it had something to do with the torches and the villagers. Michel, talk to them.",
        "MICHEL: Never. (pause) You are giving me that look aren't you? Your patented, \"Do it or something unspeakable shall befall you\" look. (sighs) Fine. I shall be French but I shall not be happy.",
        "LORELAI: Then you will be yourself. Good choice.",
        "(Michel goes back to the French group.)",
        "MICHEL: Bonjour messieurs. Je m'appelle Miche. Ce soir pour vous aider.",
        "MAN: (laughs) Vous avez fa\u00eett un blague. Tr\u00e8s drole! Tr\u00e8s drole Michel!",
        "MICHEL: (to Lorelai) Kill me now.",
        "(Cut to the bake sale at Chilton.)",
        "SOOKIE: OK-- we've got our French fantasies, American treats, and our Italian taste sensations. Well, what do you think?",
        "RORY: Amazing.",
        "LORELAI: Incredible.",
        "SOOKIE: It is good, isn't it? Well, final touch.",
        "(Sookie prepares to light a swan-shaped dessert on fire.)",
        "RORY: Oh, can I do that?",
        "SOOKIE: Whoa, honey, this is a more delicate procedure than you might think, OK?",
        "RORY: OK.",
        "SOOKIE: It takes an expert hand.",
        "(SOOKIE lights the tablecloth on fire. Lorelai fills a cup with lemondae from a nearby table and extinguishes the flames. The women at the lemonade table give her dirty looks.",
        "LORELAI: Um -- hi. Oh, well, gee...what is that, a dollar? Let me find you a dollar. You know what? I'll take two -- I'll drink one. (drinks) Mmm...tasty and flame-retardant.",
        "(Mr. Medina walks up to Lorelai.)",
        "MR. MEDINA: Very Henry the Eighth.",
        "LORELAI: Well we're not into subtle.",
        "MR. MEDINA: Good to see you, Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: Good to see you, Mr. Medina.",
        "MR. MEDINA: Max.",
        "LORELAI: Mr. Medina.",
        "MR. MEDINA: Max.",
        "LORELAI: Mr. Medina. Meet Sookie, the cheft at the inn. Sookie, Mr. Medina.",
        "SOOKIE: What's your name again?",
        "LORELAI: Mr. Medina.",
        "SOOKIE: I know, you've said it like a zillion times. (to Mr. Medina) Hello.",
        "MR. MEDINA: Hello. Lorelai, could I borrow you for a second?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, yeah, sure. (to Sookie) Oh! Hey I'll be right back.",
        "(Lorelai and Mr. Medina walk away from the table.)",
        "MR. MEDINA: You know, Lorelai, I would love for the ice to thaw.",
        "LORELAI: There's no ice.",
        "MR. MEDINA: Well you repeated my full name four times. That's ice.",
        "LORELAI: No, that's not ice, it's wintry.",
        "MR. MEDINA: I was doing my job when I didn't let Rory take that test. I didn't like it but I had to do it.",
        "LORELAI: I know.",
        "MR. MEDINA: And I'd do it again.",
        "LORELAI: OK.",
        "MR. MEDINA: I really do think Rory's a great kid and I'm going to do my damnedest to make sure she gets through Chilton in one piece.",
        "LORELAI: I appreciate that.",
        "MR. MEDINA: And I'd like us to be friends.",
        "LORELAI: We are. Me too.",
        "MR. MEDINA: Yeah?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah. Really, truly, I swear. There's no more ice. We're walking in a pool of tepid water.",
        "MR. MEDINA: Good.",
        "LORELAI: Good.",
        "MR. MEDINA: I'm going to propose something here. I'm not sure how you're going to take it.",
        "LORELAI: Oh wow, intrigue.",
        "MR. MEDINA: I'd like to see you sometime. Away from the ivy, away from the gargoyles, away from here.",
        "LORELAI: Are you asking me out on a date.",
        "MR. MEDINA: Yes.",
        "LORELAI: Mm. Well, uh, I don't want to go out on a limb here, but I'm guessing if the headmaster won't let a kid be thirty seconds late for a test he'd probably frown on a teacher dating a mom.",
        "MR. MEDINA: I do my job well, I'm dedicated to my students, and there's nothing in the Chilton book of ethics that prohibits it.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah but I'm guessing it's sort of an unwritten rule.",
        "MR. MEDINA: Do you want to go?",
        "LORELAI: And Rory would probably freak at the thought.",
        "MR. MEDINA: Do you want to go?",
        "LORELAI: And the other parents would have a field day with this kind of thing.",
        "MR. MEDINA: Do you want to go?",
        "LORELAI: Yes.",
        "MR. MEDINA: Good.",
        "LORELAI: Wait.",
        "MR. MEDINA: What?",
        "LORELAI: No.",
        "MR. MEDINA: Why?",
        "LORELAI: I can't. It's wrong. It's weird.",
        "MR. MEDINA: I'll pay.",
        "LORELAI: You're on.",
        "MR. MEDINA: Really?",
        "LORELAI: I'm kidding. I don't know. You're Rory's teacher.",
        "MR. MEDINA: I know.",
        "LORELAI: Could you quit? Right, that's crazy.",
        "MR. MEDINA: OK, OK. Um...how about coffee? You like coffee?",
        "LORELAI: Only with my oxygen.",
        "MR. MEDINA: Can we drink some together? A sort of pre-date. Very casual, no strings, no obligations. We'll just see if it's even worth going down the road of including food in the deal. (whispers) Just coffee. (normal voice) Decaf? There's nothing safer than decaf.",
        "LORELAI: I'm going to be in town tomorrow because I take a class at Hartford State and there's a coffee shop across the street that I sometimes, almost all the time, go to around 4:00 and usually exactly 4:12. I could not stop a person from entering said establishment around that time, nor would I avoid them if I knew them if they did.",
        "MR. MEDINA: You know the wordsmith thing -- that's something we have in common.",
        "LORELAI: See you around, Max.",
        "MR. MEDINA: Indeed. You will.",
        "(Cut to Lane and Rory walking down the street.)",
        "LANE: Philadelphia.",
        "RORY: Philadelphia? If you could live in any city in the world you'd pick Philadelphia?",
        "LANE: M. Night Shymalan lives there.",
        "RORY: Who?",
        "LANE: The guy who directed 'The Sixth Sense.'",
        "RORY: But what would you do there?",
        "LANE: Hang out with M. Night Shymalan.",
        "RORY: OK, cross 'guidance counselor' off your list of potential career choices.",
        "(They meet Babette, Morey, and Cinnamon.)",
        "BABETTE: Lie still, baby doll, we're almost home.",
        "RORY: Hey Babette.",
        "BABETTE: Hey kids.",
        "(Cinnamon meows strangely.)",
        "RORY: Wow, that sounds bad.",
        "BABETTE: Cinnamon's dyspeptic. So's Morey. Too many clams.",
        "MOREY: Bad clams.",
        "(Babette, Morey, and Cinnamon continue walking.)",
        "BABETTE: This doesn't reflect well on Al's establishment.",
        "LANE: You had clams at Al's?",
        "RORY: Al's Pancake World?",
        "BABETTE: Yeah, well we had a coupon.",
        "RORY: Hmmm.",
        "(Rory and Lane resume walking down the street. Rory spots Dean in the grocery store where he is working.)",
        "RORY: Oh wow! The store! Hey, listen, I have to pick up some stuff, so --",
        "LANE: What do you have to pick up?",
        "RORY: Just some...stuff. So I'll talk to you later tonight.",
        "LANE: I'll go in with you.",
        "RORY: Why?",
        "LANE: Because otherwise I'd have to go home.",
        "RORY: Home is good.",
        "LANE: My home?",
        "RORY: Yeah, actually I don't have to go in.",
        "LANE: OK. Then I guess I will go home.",
        "RORY: Great! Go, bye.",
        "LANE: Bye...freak.",
        "(Lane leaves. Rory walks into the store and watches Dean. He looks over and waves when he sees her. Rory ducks into an aisle and walks to the back of the store where Miss Patty is.)",
        "MISS PATTY: Rory! Hello! Try a plum They're better than s*x.",
        "RORY: Um, no, thanks.",
        "MISS PATTY: Fresh fruit always has such a sensuality about it. Are you too young for this?",
        "RORY: Definitely.",
        "MISS PATTY: Well what are you here for honey?",
        "RORY: Oh well, I just --",
        "(Rory looks over at Dean.)",
        "MISS PATTY: Oh, I see what you're here for. Well that wouldn't fit in a basket. No no no no no!",
        "RORY: Patty! It's not like that. He's just a person.",
        "MISS PATTY: A person?",
        "RORY: A boy-type person.",
        "MISS PATTY: Oh, my favorite kind.",
        "RORY: I really don't even know him.",
        "MISS PATTY: Oh, right. You don't know him?",
        "RORY: I don't.",
        "MISS PATTY: You said.",
        "RORY: Please don't say anything.",
        "MISS PATTY: I promise I won't tell a single soul that you don't know that young man.",
        "RORY: Thank you.",
        "MISS PATTY: You're welcome.",
        "(Rory walks away from Miss Patty. A store employee confronts Miss Patty, who has been sampling the produce.)",
        "EMPLOYEE: Excuse me, ma'am, what are you doing?",
        "MISS PATTY: Please, honey, don't call me ma'am. It makes me feel older than 25. Here, have a pea pod.",
        "EMPLOYEE: I assume that you're going to pay for the food you've consumed on the premises.",
        "MISS PATTY: Oh, so brusque. And you are?",
        "EMPLOYEE: I'm the new assistant manager here.",
        "MISS PATTY: Well listen here, my fine friend, who if you had a better hairstyle i might consider dating, I do this all the time.",
        "EMPLOYEE: Not from now on, I'm sorry.",
        "MISS PATTY: Oh, now, wait a minute here. I've been sampling food at this establishment for years.",
        "EMPLOYEE: The next time you put something in that mouth that doesn't belong there, I'm going to remove it and then call the police.",
        "(He takes the pea pod out of her hand and walks away. By now Rory is at the check-out counter. Dean walks over to the end of the counter.)",
        "CASHIER: Is this all you want, honey? A head of lettuce and a mouse trap?",
        "RORY: That should do it.",
        "DEAN: That's a couple of must-need items there.",
        "CASHIER: $2.27.",
        "RORY: I only have a dollar.",
        "DEAN: I could loan you the rest.",
        "RORY: Uh, no, I'll just take the lettuce.",
        "DEAN: Perfect. You could use half of it for a salad then use the other half to clobber the mouse with.",
        "(Rory starts to leave.)",
        "DEAN: Paper or plastic?",
        "RORY: I'm fine.",
        "(She leaves the store.)",
        "(Cut to Lorelai entering the coffee shop in Hartford. She sits at the counter near Mr. Medina.)",
        "MR. MEDINA: Lorelai?",
        "LORELAI: Max! Hi!",
        "MR. MEDINA: Small world, huh?",
        "LORELAI: Absolutely! What are you drinking?",
        "MR. MEDINA: Coffee.",
        "LORELAI: Plain coffee?",
        "MR. MEDINA: I wanted some cream but that prompted a very elaborate foam conversation. And the look of disapproval I got when I said I didn't want foam, just cream, rivaled the one I got from my dad when I told him I wanted to be a teacher.",
        "LORELAI: Wow, so it's been a tough outing for you, huh?",
        "MR. MEDINA: Well it's getting better.",
        "WAITRESS: What can I get you?",
        "LORELAI: Coffee, please.",
        "(The waitress goes to get Lorelai's coffee.)",
        "MR. MEDINA: So, here we are.",
        "LORELAI: Here we most certainly are.",
        "MR. MEDINA: Running into each other.",
        "LORELAI: Away from the school.",
        "MR. MEDINA: And its unique strictures.",
        "LORELAI: These things do happen.",
        "MR. MEDINA: Fate can be funny.",
        "LORELAI: Should we cut the cute and just get right to it?",
        "MR. MEDINA: I think we should date.",
        "LORELAI: Why?",
        "MR. MEDINA: Because I think we both want to.",
        "LORELAI: Well I want to be in the Bangles but that doesn't mean I quit my job and get a guitar and ruin my life to be a Bangle, does it?",
        "MR. MEDINA: The Bangles broke up.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, that's not the point.",
        "MR. MEDINA: Well it's got to be part of the point if there's no band anymore.",
        "LORELAI: I repeat my question: 'why should we date?'",
        "MR. MEDINA: Because we're clearly attracted to each other.",
        "LORELAI: I'm attracted to pie. It doesn't mean I feel the need to date pie.",
        "MR. MEDINA: OK then because we are --",

        "MR. MEDINA: No. Now he thinks 'this is perfect. I'll come back, I'll have a career, I'll have served my country, I'll be worthy of her love.' When he gets back -- she's gone. Moved away. No one knew where and he never saw that girl again. Now my uncle, he didn't say much to me, but the one thing he did say was that if there's something in your gut that you know you feel is right you gotta go after it, no matter what. What do you say?",

        "LORELAI: Oh there are many problems. First -- I do not like to involve Rory in my personal life. I don't want her to have to deal with that. You know, I might bring some guy home and he might not be THE guy but then she gets all attached to him and then all of a sudden I decide that I don't like the way he eats or he hums incessantly or --",
        "SOOKIE: Or the way he smacks his lips or how his hair isn't really his.",

I think the whole Angelina Jolie/Billy Bob Thronton thing really proves that. And I know you don't understand this now but you wil someday. You'll meet some great guy and he'll make your head all foggy and you won't know what to do with yourself. (sighs) Oh, sweetie, I won't keep anything from you again. OK? I promise.
