    "Recap": [
        "Headmaster Charleston decrees that both Gilmore girls need to improve their socialization skills at Chilton if they want him to write a glowing recommendation for Rory's Harvard application. Rory's first attempt to socialize leads her to ask a group of girls at lunch if she could join them. They agree and hit it off famously. After lunch, an insanely jealous Paris accosts Rory and tells her the group that she innocently stumbled into is \"The Puffs\", Chilton's famed secret sorority. Paris would do anything to join, and she begs Rory not to bad-mouth her to the group. At the next opportunity, Rory talks Paris up to the group and they are both accepted as pledges. The Puffs \"kidnap\" Rory, Paris and the other pledges very early one morning under the guise of taking them to breakfast, but instead take them to Headmaster Charleston's office to be initiated into the group. In the middle of the ceremony, they are discovered by Charleston and the security guards. He calls their parents and threatens their college careers, until Rory stands up to him and says that if he hadn't forced her to socialize, she wouldn't be there at all. He agrees and reconsiders, saying that she is a good student who deserves to go to Harvard. After being chided by Emily for her lack of participation, Lorelai joins the Booster Club and offers to host a fundraising fashion show at the Inn. To her dismay, she discovers that the Booster Club mothers are the models; not wanting to be mortified by herself, and to exact a little payback for being chided, she signs Emily up to model as well. On the day of the show, Lorelai calls Luke to fix the runway, and he catches the eye of Eva, the Booster Club president, who's quite taken with him. Lorelai becomes uncomfortable when she sees them huddled together talking. The day goes even further downhill when Lorelai discovers that she and Emily will be modeling matching mother-daughter outfits. They end up looking terrific and having a ball struting their stuff on the runway, and the show is a tremendous success. Back in Stars Hollow, Lorelai visits Luke at the diner and asks him not to go out with Eva. She offers the pathetic reason that she wants to keep her Stars Hollow life and her Chilton life separate, and that Luke's dating Eva will combine the two. Luke sees right through her, and after letting her know that he'll date whoever he pleases, tells her that he's not interested in Eva and was only giving her directions back to Hartford. Lorelai, secretly happy but realizing she's made a fool of herself, hurries out of the diner, to Luke's amusement."

        "OPEN AT LUKE'S DINER",
        "[Lorelai and Rory walk in and sit at a table.]",
        "LORELAI: Wow, busy today. Has Luke been advertising or something?",
        "RORY: He gets good word-of-mouth.",
        "LORELAI: Well, we have to start spreading bad word-of-mouth so we can always have a table.",
        "RORY: Well, that would be wrong, but sure. Vermin?",
        "LORELAI: Or no potable water.",
        "RORY: Or no potable vermin.",
        "LORELAI: That would scare them away.",
        "RORY: Or confuse them away.",
        "[Lorelai sees Luke talking with one of the customers.]",
        "LORELAI: It's so weird to see him talking like that.",
        "RORY: Like what?",
        "LORELAI: Just all friendly. He's usually only good for a quick couple of gruff monosyllables, and then he's off.",
        "RORY: He is the master of the monosyllable.",
        "LORELAI: He never flirts with any of the women, do you notice that?",
        "RORY: He's flirted with you numerous times.",
        "LORELAI: Don't start.",
        "RORY: Hey, flirt with him now, we need coffee.",
        "LORELAI: Oh Luke, we're just dying for some refreshments.",
        "LUKE: Keep your pants on.",
        "LORELAI: Hmm. He can turn it off and turn it on so fast.",
        "RORY: Hey, I found a CD under the front seat of our car. Did you lose one?",
        "LORELAI: Not that I know of, but I'm kind of sloppy with them.",
        "RORY: So, you didn't hide it?",
        "LORELAI: Why would I hide a CD?",
        "RORY: I don't know. Bay City Rollers?",
        "LORELAI: It's not a Bay City Rollers CD.",
        "RORY: How do you know?",
        "LORELAI: Because I know what's not hidden under that seat.",
        "RORY: Ha! Because you know that Barry Manilow is under that seat.",
        "LORELAI: Ugh.",
        "LUKE: Where's Barry Manilow?",
        "RORY: Under Mom's seat.",
        "LORELAI: All right, I confess, I was hiding Barry Manilow.",
        "RORY: You confess!",
        "LORELAI: But he was very big when I was very small and it's the live version where he does a medley of all the commercial jingles he's written.",
        "RORY: Don't worry. Everyone's allowed a guilty pleasure now and again.",
        "LORELAI: Hm, very diplomatic from the girl who had the Bryan Adams poster above her bed for two years.",
        "RORY: Fink.",
        "LORELAI: Do you have a guilty pleasure Luke?",
        "LUKE: Nah.",
        "LORELAI: Are you into music?",
        "LUKE: Sure.",
        "LORELAI: Monosyllabic man strikes again.",
        "RORY: We'll have two muffins please.",
        "LUKE: You got it. [walks away]",
        "LORELAI: Do you think he's dated anyone since Rachel?",
        "RORY: I don't know. Where would he meet anyone? He's either here or in his apartment.",
        "LORELAI: Maybe he has a secret life. Maybe he's got a little chippy stowed away in Mount Pilot.",
        "RORY: Well, we'll know eventually.",
        "LORELAI: I say he's a bachelor for life.",
        "RORY: I say there's someone for everyone. [starts laughing]",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "RORY: Uhh, Barry Manilow.",
        "LORELAI: Ugh, stop.",
        "RORY: [sings] Looks like we made it",
        "LORELAI: Oh yeah? Spice Girls.",
        "RORY: Duran Duran.",
        "LORELAI: Dido.",
        "RORY: Olivia Newton John.",
        "LORELAI: The Macarena. You and Lane for hours and hours, for weeks on end.",
        "RORY: Hey, we were mocking. You can't mock the mocking.",
        "LORELAI: All right. It's getting ugly. Let's stop.",
        "RORY: Let's be friends again.",
        "LORELAI: All right.",
        "RORY: [giggles]",
        "LORELAI: Stop it.",
        "[opening credits]",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "[Rory is in the kitchen, Lorelai walks in.]",
        "LORELAI: Agh.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: The car won't start.",
        "RORY: What happened?",
        "LORELAI: I don't know. It's just dead. I turned the key and it makes a horrible sound.",
        "RORY: What kind of sound?",
        "LORELAI: Like rrrar, rrrar, rrrar. You know, but less feminine.",
        "RORY: That's the battery.",
        "LORELAI: Well, what did I ever do to make the battery mad?",
        "RORY: Let's see. You've kept the radio on all night, killing the battery. You've kept the lights on all night, killing the battery. You've kept the door open, which keeps the ceiling light on, all night, killing the battery.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, well then I've done multiple things to make the battery mad.",
        "RORY: You gonna walk?",
        "LORELAI: I'm wearing heels.",
        "RORY: Change your shoes.",
        "LORELAI: I'd have to change my outfit.",
        "RORY: Change your outfit.",
        "LORELAI: I'd have to walk upstairs.",
        "RORY: Suddenly I'm living with Zsa Zsa Gabor.",
        "LORELAI: I'm gonna call Michel.",
        "RORY: This thing is too small.",
        "MICHEL: Independence Inn.",
        "LORELAI: Hold on Michel. That backpack is not too small.",
        "RORY: It's miniscule.",
        "LORELAI: Just take your schoolbooks and leave some of the other books.",
        "RORY: I need all of my other books.",
        "LORELAI: You don't need all of these.",
        "RORY: I think I do.",
        "LORELAI: Edna St. Vincent Milay?",
        "RORY: That's my bus book.",
        "LORELAI: Uh huh. What's the Faulkner?",
        "RORY: My other bus book.",
        "LORELAI: So just take one bus book.",
        "RORY: No, the Milay is a biography, and sometimes if I'm on the bus and I pull out a biography and I think to myself, 'Well, I don't really feel like reading about a person's life right now' then I'll switch to the novel, and then sometimes if I'm not into the novel, I'll switch back.",
        "LORELAI: Hmm. Still there Michel?",
        "RORY: Yes, I. . .",
        "LORELAI: Hold on. What is the Gore Vidal?",
        "RORY: Oh, that's my lunch book.",
        "LORELAI: Uh huh. So lose the Vidal or the Faulkner. You don't need two novels.",
        "RORY: Vidal's essays.",
        "LORELAI: Uh huh. But the Eudora Welty's not essays or a biography.",
        "RORY: Right.",
        "LORELAI: So it's another novel, lose it!",
        "RORY: Unh uh. It's short stories.",
        "LORELAI: Ugh. This is a sickness. Michel.",
        "RORY: I am growing very old.",
        "LORELAI: Come pick me up?",
        "MICHEL: I am already here.",
        "LORELAI: Put Carol on the desk and come pick me up.",
        "MICHEL: I am not speaking to Carol. She ate my low-fat cheese.",
        "LORELAI: Michel, come pick me up and I will buy you some cheese.",
        "MICHEL: Low-fat cheese.",
        "LORELAI: Low-fat cheese.",
        "MICHEL: Low-fat American cheese.",
        "LORELAI: Low-fat American cheese.",
        "MICHEL: And a meringue cookie.",
        "LORELAI: Just get over here.",
        "MICHEL: Fine.",
        "RORY: Ha! I made it all fit. Edna, Bill, Gore and Eudora, all safe and sound.",
        "LORELAI: Cool. That's your French book.",
        "RORY: Hmm? Oh, I know. I'm carrying my French book.",
        "LORELAI: Mm hmm. You so thought that French book was already in there.",
        "RORY: I did not.",
        "LORELAI: You have a problem.",
        "RORY: No I don't.",
        "LORELAI: You're gonna tip over from the weight of that backpack.",
        "RORY: No I'm not.",
        "LORELAI: I'm gonna have to buy you a forklift. Bye.",
        "CUT TO CHILTON CAFETERIA",
        "[Rory walks in carrying her lunch tray. She sits down at a table, puts on her walkman, and starts reading a book. A woman suddenly taps her on the shoulder.]",
        "MRS. VERDINAS: I startled you. I didn't mean to.",
        "RORY: That's okay. I'm easily startled.",
        "MRS. VERDINAS: I'm Mrs. Verdinas, the guidance counselor. Your name's Rory, isn't it? Rory Gilmore?",
        "RORY: Yes. Hello.",
        "MRS. VERDINAS: Hello. I'd love to sit and talk to you. Can we do that?",
        "RORY: Sure. Anytime.",
        "MRS. VERDINAS: How about after you finish your lunch?",
        "RORY: Oh, that soon?",
        "MRS. VERDINAS: I think soon would be good.",
        "RORY: Okay, what's this about?",
        "MRS. VERDINAS: We'll talk about it then.",
        "RORY: Not even a hint?",
        "MRS. VERDINAS: See you in a little bit.",
        "RORY: Right. Right.",
        "CUT TO MRS. VERDINAS' OFFICE",
        "[Mrs. Verdinas is sitting at her desk; Rory knocks at the door.]",
        "MRS. VERDINAS: Come in. Hello Rory, have a seat.",
        "RORY: Thank you.",
        "MRS. VERDINAS: So don't worry about being late for your next class. I'll write you a note if you are.",
        "RORY: Okay.",
        "MRS. VERDINAS: I know from your record you're a stickler for punctuality.",
        "RORY: I am a stickler, yes. I only slipped one time last year. I hit a deer. Actually, he hit me. Or she did. Or not me, my car. But, um, then he or she ran away, and I think it turned out okay. I didn't see it again, so I can't definitively say but I did look for him or her. It's a big story for me, I'm surprised I don't tell it better.",
        "MRS. VERDINAS: Why don't we get to the reason I asked you here?",
        "RORY: Okay.",
        "MRS. VERDINAS: Headmaster Charleston brought you to my attention a few weeks ago. He's worried, and after observing you a bit, I'm worried too.",
        "RORY: You've been observing me?",
        "MRS. VERDINAS: We've been concerned about your social behavior here at school.",
        "RORY: What about it?",
        "MRS. VERDINAS: You don't seem to interact much with the other students.",
        "RORY: I do sometimes. In class, all the time.",
        "MRS. VERDINAS: But rarely outside of class. At lunch, you're always by yourself.",
        "RORY: That's when I catch up on my reading.",
        "MRS. VERDINAS: And that walkman, it makes you very unapproachable.",
        "RORY: You approached me.",
        "MRS. VERDINAS: And you almost jumped out of your skin. What does that tell you?",
        "RORY: That I'm jumpy. On the Fourth of July, forget it, I'm a wreck. And when the Stars Hollow orchestra begins to play in the gazebo, the guy banging the cymbals, I'm. . .it drives me nuts.",
        "MRS. VERDINAS: Denying a problem doesn't solve a problem, Rory. Unless something changes, this could affect your future.",
        "RORY: But I don't understand. I get good grades, isn't that enough?",
        "MRS. VERDINAS: You know, it's not. Rory, when we make recommendations to universities on behalf of a student, that student's social skills are a big part of it. Now, I assume you want to go to a university?",
        "RORY: Absolutely.",
        "MRS. VERDINAS: Well, universities do not look kindly on loners.",
        "RORY: But I'm not a loner.",
        "MRS. VERDINAS: Really? Well, what do you think a loner is?",
        "RORY: Loners are those guys that you see walking around wearing, I don't know, out of date clothing, bell bottoms, and they tend to carry a duffel bag with God knows what inside. That's a loner.",
        "MRS. VERDINAS: Loners come in all different shapes and sizes, even pretty girls. Just try to improve Rory. Mix it up with others. You may even enjoy it. Start with lunch.",
        "RORY: I don't suppose there's a lunchtime reading/walkman-listening club I can join, is there? I guess that's no.",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S FRONT YARD",
        "[Lorelai and Rory sit on the porch as Kirk fixes Lorelai's Jeep.]",
        "LORELAI: So what does she expect you to do?",
        "RORY: She said mix it up.",
        "LORELAI: Mix it up, what does that mean?",
        "RORY: I guess that means going up to strange kids at school and saying, 'Hey, mind if I awkwardly butt in where I don't belong and don't want to be?'",
        "LORELAI: The whole thing's ridiculous. Chilton is a cult.",
        "KIRK: Lorelai, do you know what this is? [holds up a bundle of wires]",
        "LORELAI: Um, no.",
        "KIRK: Damn.",
        "RORY: I don't know. Maybe there is something wrong with me.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, don't say that.",
        "RORY: Maybe I am a loner. I mean, you were mocking my backpack today. I might just be one step away from carrying a mysterious duffel bag.",
        "LORELAI: Oh no, no you don't. Don't you go doubting who you are or how you should be. How dare that woman do this to you!",
        "RORY: It wasn't just her. The whole meeting was Charleston's suggestion.",
        "LORELAI: Well, good. It's time I called on old Schnickelfritz Charleston to tell him to stop messing with my kid's mind.",
        "RORY: Mom.",
        "LORELAI: No, I'm sorry. I don't like this. Schools like Chilton try to stamp out every vestige of individuality and I'm not gonna let that happen.",
        "KIRK: It's all fixed. I found a loose terminal. I reconnected the battery and jumped it, so it's set to go.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, thanks Kirk.",
        "KIRK: And I'm not gonna charge you for the time I spent stuck underneath the car.",
        "LORELAI: That's great Kirk.",
        "KIRK: And I just want you to know that I overheard, and you're absolutely right. I carried a duffel bag and ate lunch by myself my entire school career, and I turned out just fine. [leaves]",
        "LORELAI: I'm still going down there.",
        "CUT TO CHILTON",
        "[The secretary walks Lorelai into the Headmaster's office.]",
        "SECRETARY: Ms. Gilmore is here. [leaves]",
        "LORELAI: Hello Mr. Charleston.",
        "HEADMASTER: Ms. Gilmore, so good to see you.",
        "LORELAI: It's good to be here.",
        "HEADMASTER: You know, I checked my records to remind myself why I asked you in only to discover that you had actually called for this meeting.",
        "LORELAI: Yes I did.",
        "HEADMASTER: I'm surprised. We don't see you often. We'd forgotten what you'd looked like.",
        "LORELAI: Well, I'm pretty much the same. Rosy cheeks, strong of bone, sly of wit.",
        "HEADMASTER: How nice. So why did you want to see me?",
        "LORELAI: Well, I wanted to talk to you about Rory and uh, this ridiculous accusation about her being a loner and how that's somehow something bad.",
        "HEADMASTER: Well, it is bad.",
        "LORELAI: No, it's not bad, it's just her. I raised Rory to do what she wants as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else. And I don't see how her reading a book or listening to a walkman is hurting anyone.",
        "HEADMASTER: It's hurting her.",
        "LORELAI: I respectfully disagree.",
        "HEADMASTER: That doesn't surprise me, based on my research.",
        "LORELAI: What research?",
        "HEADMASTER: When I saw your name on the appointment list, I decided to have a look at the file.",
        "LORELAI: Ah yes, Rory's file's been of a lot of interest to you guys lately, hasn't it?",
        "HEADMASTER: I wasn't talking about Rory's file. I was talking about yours.",
        "LORELAI: I have a file?",
        "HEADMASTER: You most certainly do.",
        "LORELAI: It's tiny.",
        "HEADMASTER: It's very thin.",
        "LORELAI: Well that's good, right? It means I haven't gotten into a lot of trouble.",
        "HEADMASTER: On the contrary, a thin file for a parent indicates lack of participation.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, now wait a minute. I've participated in stuff.",
        "HEADMASTER: You attended the bake sale.",
        "LORELAI: And I sold stuff.",
        "HEADMASTER: Then promptly left.",
        "LORELAI: I was busy.",
        "HEADMASTER: Without fraternizing with the other Chilton parents at all.",
        "LORELAI: Busy, busy, busy like a really tall bee.",
        "HEADMASTER: Like mother, like daughter.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, hold on.",
        "HEADMASTER: Ms. Gilmore, active participation in Chilton activities for a parent is vitally important.",
        "LORELAI: But",
        "HEADMASTER: This is a list of organizations sponsored by Chilton. Parent groups dedicated to certain specific tasks.",
        "LORELAI: Uh, my",
        "HEADMASTER: Any one of them would be honored by your participation.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, my schedule is",
        "HEADMASTER: We're all tremendously busy, Ms. Gilmore. I hope you're not too busy to do what's best for you or what's best for Rory, are you?",
        "LORELAI: No.",
        "HEADMASTER: Excellent. Let us know what it will be.",
        "LORELAI: I will. [stands up to leave] Oh, may I go?",
        "HEADMASTER: Yes, you may.",
        "LORELAI: Okay.",
        "HEADMASTER: I'm glad you came in today. It was a good idea.",
        "LORELAI: Yes. I'm just full of good ideas.",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S KITCHEN",
        "[Lorelai sits at the table going through papers as Rory comes home.]",
        "RORY: Hey.",
        "LORELAI: Hey.",
        "RORY: Hey.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, look Fat Albert. Get me a soda, will you?",
        "RORY: Mom, what are you doing here? You were supposed to meet me in my Latin class after meeting with Headmaster Charleston.",
        "LORELAI: Oh my God. I was. I totally forgot. Ugh, I'm so sorry.",
        "RORY: Mom, come on, what happened. Did you talk to him?",
        "LORELAI: I did. I told him that he was completely out of line with this treatment of you, that you are not a loner freak, you have plenty of friends, and you don't own a long black leather Matrix coat, and they should fall down on their kneesocks everyday that you deign to show up at that loser school.",
        "RORY: And?",
        "LORELAI: And then he yelled at me.",
        "RORY: He what?",
        "LORELAI: He pulled out a file and told me I was a bad Chilton mom.",
        "RORY: He did not.",
        "LORELAI: And that I don't participate in school activities.",
        "RORY: Well, you work.",
        "LORELAI: And I don't make posters.",
        "RORY: You have no artistic capabilities.",
        "LORELAI: And I don't chaperone school dances.",
        "RORY: Does he know that you got pregnant at sixteen?",
        "LORELAI: Basically I'm not doing my part to help further your educational future.",
        "RORY: So we both got busted.",
        "LORELAI: Yes.",
        "RORY: Great.",
        "LORELAI: Now I have to pick a group or a cause or sponsor a club or something.",
        "RORY: This sucks.",
        "LORELAI: But hey, I've been thinking. I mean, the whole reason we did this Chilton thing is for you to get into Harvard, right?",
        "RORY: Right.",
        "LORELAI: And these fanatics that run your school, they're the ones that write the letters to the fancy colleges saying things like, 'Hey she's keen, look at her' or 'Have you seen the L tattooed on her forehead, 'cause it sure is a big one.'",
        "RORY: So you're saying we should just go along with this?",
