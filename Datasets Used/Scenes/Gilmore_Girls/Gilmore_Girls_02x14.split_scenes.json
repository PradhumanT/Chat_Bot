    "Recap": [
        "Christopher comes to town on a business trip with his girlfriend Sherry in tow. Since Sherry and Christopher's relationship is getting serious, Sherry wants to begin bonding with Rory -- on Friday night. Without consulting Emily, Lorelai excuses Rory from the Gilmore Friday night dinner, and takes Christopher with her instead. When Emily finds out about Sherry over cocktails, she has a meltdown and rushes off to the kitchen. Lorelai follows her there and finds out that Emily has always envisioned that Lorelai and Christopher would end up together. Now that she sees that this isn't going to happen, Emily blames Lorelai for always keeping him, and everyone else, at arms length. After mulling over her mother's words, the next morning Lorelai tells Christopher that she's always thought that they would get back together, too, and that's why she's never had a relationship that lasted, including the one with Max. Christopher gets very angry, refusing to accept the responsibility for the way Lorelai's romantic life has turned out."

        "OPEN IN STARS HOLLOW",
        "[Lorelai and Rory walk down the street towards Luke's]",
        "LORELAI: But my question is, how did that happen? How was it that suddenly everyone in the world was saying \u0091music has charms to soothe the savage beast' when it was written breast.",
        "RORY: I don't know. At some point someone misspoke and it just caught on.",
        "LORELAI: How do things like that catch on?",
        "RORY: Mom, please, you're driving me crazy.",
        "LORELAI: I mean, did some guy like say it at a big rally of some sort and everyone went home and started saying it that way and then it just spread from there?",
        "RORY: Yes, exactly.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, now you're just trying to shut me up.",
        "[they walk into Luke's Diner, no one's in there except Luke]",
        "LORELAI: Oh my God.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: Look.",
        "RORY: Wow.",
        "LORELAI: Empty.",
        "LUKE: Just one of those weird lulls, happens occasionally.",
        "LORELAI: Ugh.",
        "RORY: Can we sit wherever we like?",
        "LUKE: Wherever you like.",
        "RORY: Wow.",
        "LORELAI: Such luxury I never dreamed of.",
        "RORY: Where do you wanna sit?",
        "LORELAI: I don't know. Um, how \u0091bout this table with it's unobstructed westward view of the wide cosmopolitan expansive Klump Street?",
        "RORY: Tempting. Do you know that on a clear day you can see all the way to the garbage cans behind Al's Pancake World?",
        "LORELAI: Hm. Or we could sit in the corner - you know, the Mafia table so that no one can come up behind you and whack you with a cannoli.",
        "RORY: Whack you with a cannoli? Oh, because he left the gun and took the cannoli.",
        "LORELAI: You're so my daughter.",
        "LUKE: Aye aye aye.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, let's sit at the counter.",
        "RORY: Nah, the counter, those are not the power seats.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, but with no one here we can sit at either end and play bagel hockey.",
        "RORY: Ooh, bagel hockey! Oh boy!",
        "LUKE: Just sit at a table.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, you're awfully rude for a guy who only has two paying customers.",
        "RORY: Okay, 3:30 on Friday - my debate at Chilton. Write it down.",
        "LORELAI: Already written.",
        "RORY: Good.",
        "LORELAI: Are you prepared?",
        "RORY: Please. Paris has us beyond prepared. I now know more about doctor assisted suicide then I ever cared to.",
        "LORELAI: Cheery topic",
        "[phone rings]",
        "LUKE: Luke's. Uh huh. Hold on a second. [to Rory] It's for you.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LUKE: Yup.",
        "RORY: But who knows we're here?",
        "LORELAI: This whole morning has been a little Twilight Zone-y.",
        "LUKE: Or Outer Limits-y.",
        "LORELAI: What?",
        "LUKE: Great show, just as eerie, same era, but no one ever references it.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, I'm sorry, I don't speak geek.",
        "LUKE: Yup, stepped right in it.",
        "RORY: Hello?",
        "LANE: Rory?",
        "RORY: Lane. How did you know I was here?",
        "LANE: Telescope. I got a clean shot at Luke's. I saw you and your mom go in.",
        "[Rory walks over to the window, stretching the phone cord across the diner]",
        "LUKE: Hey, watch it.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, duck Harvey.",
        "RORY: So I guess you're still grounded over that whole Henry thing, huh?",
        "LANE: Are you kidding? It's the mother of all groundings. My mom's done everything but slap a Dr. Dre ankle bracelet on me. I'm not even going to school.",
        "RORY: Isn't it illegal to keep a kid out of school?",
        "LANE: Well, she talked all my teachers into allowing me to be home-schooled for two weeks. I believe the words \u0091highly contagious' were batted about. I only get five minutes a day of outside phone time but unlimited time to call the Psalm a Day line. A big ripoff, by the way, because psalm 79 has been on there for three straight days. That's not in keeping with what their name clearly implies, which is a new psalm per day, every day. Not the same tired one from the previous two days.",
        "RORY: I've never heard anyone get so riled up about psalms before.",
        "LANE: My world has become very small. Okay, I'm dying for news. Give me some headlines.",
        "RORY: Oh, well, I've got a debate coming up. And, um, Dean's been working extra hours lately saving up for a new motorcycle, so I hardly see him. Mom and I haven't done laundry in three weeks, but I have taken to jumping into the gigantic pile of dirty clothes while we play our Reader's Digest World's Famous Polka CD that we got used for ninety-nine cents. Sorry if that's all boring.",
        "LANE: Are you kidding? It's the most stimulation I've got in a week.",
        "MRS. KIM: Lane, come down for your snack!",
        "LANE: It's tea and melba toast time, gotta go. Don't forget me in my solitude.",
        "RORY: Never.",
        "LANE: Bye. [hangs up]",
        "RORY: Think fast.",
        "[Rory tosses the phone to Luke, who catches it cleanly]",
        "LORELAI: Whoa, impressive. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LORELAI: Goalie for the bagel hockey team?",
        "RORY: And bump Schmitty?",
        "LORELAI: Schmitty's over the hill, he's washed up, put him in Cooperstown. Suit up kid!",
        "LUKE: Call me if anyone sane walks in.",
        "[opening credits]",
        "CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE",
        "[Lorelai and Rory are sitting on the living room couch watching TV]",
        "RORY: There's nothing on.",
        "LORELAI: There's always something on. Uh! Struck gold!",
        "RORY: Not Two Fat Ladies again.",
        "LORELAI: Why not? They're brilliant.",
        "RORY: Because it's a cooking show and you don't cook.",
        "LORELAI: That might change.",
        "RORY: Not a chance.",
        "LORELAI: Probably not.",
        "RORY: Plus, we've seen all of them like five times. They're all repeats.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, sadly because one of the fat ladies met her maker.",
        "RORY: Really? Which one?",
        "LORELAI: The fat one.",
        "RORY: Come on, which one? The one on the motorcycle or the one in the sidecar?",
        "LORELAI: See, it's fun just talking about the Two Fat Ladies.",
        "[doorbell rings]",
        "RORY: Can't we find some other really fat people to watch?",
        "LORELAI: Wow, that sounded really insensitive.",
        "[Rory answers the door]",
        "RORY: Paris.",
        "PARIS: Can I come in?",
        "RORY: I guess. So?",
        "PARIS: You couldn't possibly be wondering what I'm doing here.",
        "RORY: I couldn't?",
        "PARIS: The debate's Friday and we need more preparation.",
        "RORY: More preparation? Paris -- no two people know more about assisted suicide than the two of us. Kevorkian called today for a couple of tips.",
        "PARIS: I know we know the material but there's issues of presentation that need to be addressed.",
        "RORY: Presentation?",
        "PARIS: I was listening to the CD I burned of the cassettes I made of our mock debates against the make-believe team and I realized that you were not talking fast enough.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "PARIS: You're only doing 135 wpm.",
        "RORY: Wpm?",
        "PARIS: Words per minute.",
        "RORY: Of course.",
        "PARIS: That's slow.",
        "RORY: That's not slow.",
        "PARIS: It's Jimmy Bob slow.",
        "RORY: I talk normally.",
        "PARIS: For the average Willie Nelson roadie, yes, but not for a winning debate team member. As a comparison, I speak an average of 178 wpm.",
        "RORY: Okay, word speed isn't everything. Sometimes I will add a dramatic pause to prove a point, undercutting my wpm.",
        "PARIS: Let's not harbor any Pinteresque fantasies here, Rory. We'll have scant minutes to make our arguments and we have to maximize our collective wpm.",
        "RORY: Okay, okay. Let's just get going.",
        "LORELAI: Hey Paris. Were we expecting you?",
        "PARIS: You should've been. I'm going to get set up. [walks to Rory's room]",
        "RORY: We're going to my room to work on my wpm.",
        "LORELAI: Do I wanna know?",
        "RORY: No.",
        "[Rory walks towards her room as the phone rings]",
        "LORELAI: I'll get it! Hello?",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Hey Lor, it's Chris.",
        "LORELAI: Hey you, how's it going?",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Good, good. I'm on a little business trip here and I thought I'd call and check in on Rory.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, she went to some biker party a few days ago and never came back.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Again?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, we gotta start disciplining that girl.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Hey, who's got the time?",
        "LORELAI: Actually, she's right here. I'll pass you to her. So where'd this business trip take you?",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Your neck of the woods, actually. I'm in the Litchfield area.",
        "LORELAI: Really? How long?",
        "CHRISTOPHER: I don't know, a couple of days, or for as long as it takes for them to succumb to my infinite charms.",
        "LORELAI: Well, if you're still here on Friday, you should come on down and see Rory in a debate at Chilton.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Really?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah. It starts at 3:30 and it's first come, first serve. They're expecting like 20,000 people so I'd get there early.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Wow, Chilton up close, huh?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, it's your chance to see the famous Paris in action. There might even be casualties.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Okay, tell Rory I'll be there.",
        "LORELAI: Really?",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Why not?",
        "LORELAI: Aw, she'll be excited. Here, tell her yourself.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Pass me on.",
        "[Lorelai stands at the doorway to Rory's bedroom]",
        "PARIS: Dairy's bad too because of the mucous. You haven't had any dairy in the last forty-eight hours, have you?",
        "RORY: In my cereal this morning.",
        "PARIS: Geez! Okay, well there's a solution of salt water and vinegar that can help cut that.",
        "LORELAI: Girls, I'm sorry to interrupt vinegar hour, but it's your dad.",
        "RORY: [takes phone and walks away] Dad, hi.",
        "PARIS: Did you give her the cereal?",
        "LORELAI: Um, I'd rather not say.",
        "CUT TO OUTSIDE",
        "[In the center of town, Rory walks down the sidewalk as a pay phone rings. She answers it]",
        "RORY: Hello?",
        "LANE: It's me.",
        "RORY: Lane, this is flat out stalking.",
        "LANE: Look, I don't have much time. I've already used up my five minutes of phone time so this is totally illicit, but I have to talk to you. There's a new Belle and Sebastian single coming out today.",
        "RORY: I know.",
        "LANE: I have to have it.",
        "RORY: Okay, well -.",
        "LANE: No, I mean I have to have it.",
        "RORY: I don't know if I have time to pick it up.",
        "LANE: What? Rory, do you wanna hear how I used up my five minutes of phone time today? Talking to Amazon.com trying to get them to overnight it to me in a plain package with a return address referencing something Korean and religious.",
        "RORY: They wouldn't do it, huh?",
        "LANE: I think they notified the government.",
        "RORY: Can't you just wait for your grounding to be over?",
        "LANE: Hey, I am a fanatic audiophile. That comes with responsibilities that a grounding doesn't alter. Now, I have to have this single and you have to figure out how to get it to me.",
        "RORY: Okay, okay, I'll do my best.",
        "LANE: Thank you, I have to go. Oh, and hey.",
        "RORY: What?",
        "LANE: You've got something in your teeth.",
        "RORY: Stop that.",
        "CUT TO CHILTON",
        "[Before the debate starts, Lorelai and Sookie enter the auditorium looking for Rory]",
        "LORELAI: Hey, there you are. Where were you?",
        "RORY: Oh, hi.",
        "LORELAI: I thought we were gonna meet by the vending machines for a little, uh, pre-debate nondairy snack.",
        "RORY: Yeah, sorry, Paris wanted to do a sound check and she found some problems with the acoustics in the room.",
        "PARIS: It's the layout on this row of seats that's causing a bass problem. We've got to move this whole row over a foot. Esta! Just move these people out. Mueva esta gente, mueva, mueva!",
        "RORY: Better find a seat before she moves them all.",
        "LORELAI: Have fun.",
        "RORY: Thanks. I'm glad you came.",
        "SOOKIE: No you're not!",
        "RORY: What?",
        "SOOKIE: I'm just getting you in the mood.",
        "[Rory walks away as Lorelai and Sookie sit down]",
        "LORELAI: So do you see Christopher anywhere?",
        "SOOKIE: [looks around] Uh, well, no, no, no. Hey, what does he look like?",
        "LORELAI: If you don't know, why are you looking?",
        "SOOKIE: I'm looking for a guy that looks like a guy that you could be with, only I'm deducting seventeen years off his age and I'm adding an all-boys private school uniform and a Yankees cap.",
        "LORELAI: And does your head hurt?",
        "SOOKIE: Yeah.",
        "MRS. O'MALLEY: If everybody could please take their seats, we'll begin. That includes all the members of the debate team.",
        "[Rory takes her seat on stage. She sees Brad sitting across from her]",
        "RORY: Brad, hi.",
        "BRAD: Hi Rory. I didn't think you'd remember me.",
        "RORY: Oh, of course I do. How's the new school?",
        "BRAD: I love it. It's way more mellow there and I made a ton of new friends.",
        "RORY: Good for you.",
        "PARIS: Well, Brad.",
        "BRAD: Paris.",
        "PARIS: Guess we're going mono a mono today, huh?",
        "BRAD: Oh God.",
        "MRS. O'MALLEY: All right, the topic for today's debate is doctor-assisted suicide.",
        "SOOKIE: That's pleasant.",
        "MRS: O'MALLEY: Let me introduce the debaters. On the Hillside Academy team, we have Brad Lankford and Nancy Waterford.",
        "NANCY: You look sick.",
        "BRAD: I feel sick.",
        "MRS. O'MALLEY: And on the Chilton team, we have Rory Gilmore and Paris Gellar.",
        "[Sookie and Lorelai cheer loudly]",
        "LORELAI: Oww!",
        "SOOKIE: Whoo!",
        "LORELAI: Oww!",
        "[Everyone else is silent]",
        "SOOKIE: Were we not supposed to do that?",
        "LORELAI: Maybe no one noticed.",
        "MRS. O'MALLEY: Each team will have three minutes for their openings, three minutes for rebuttals, and two minutes for their conclusions. They will be judged on the basis of content, strategy, and style. I will be the judge, along with Mrs. Gladstone.",
        "PARIS: Mrs. O'Malley is impregnable but yesterday I complemented Mrs. Gladstone's dumpy outfit and bought her an ice cream sandwich and she practically licked my hand in gratitude.",
        "RORY: Nice going.",
        "MRS. O'MALLEY: We choose which team will take the pro or con side with the toss of a coin. A member of Hillside will make the call.",
        "BRAD: Heads. No, tails, I mean tails!",
        "MRS. O'MALLEY: Uh, it's heads. Chilton will pick pro or con.",
        "PARIS: Pro assisted suicide.",
        "BRAD: What a shock.",
        "MRS. O'MALLEY: All right. Whenever you're ready, you may commence.",
        "PARIS: Thank you. [to Rory] Keep it snappy.",
        "[Rory walks to the podium]",
        "RORY: There are many vantage points from which to consider doctor assisted suicide. Serious consideration draws from ethics, law, medical practices, philosophy, psychology, public policy and religion, all topics I plan to explore in the next two minutes and forty-six seconds.",
        "LORELAI: Geez, look at that kid, he's shaking.",
        "SOOKIE: Ooh, and pale.",
        "LORELAI: He looks all white and tiny.",
        "RORY: ... provides either information or the actual means, such as medication or other supplies to a person who wishes to terminate his or her own life. The patient must then initiate the process. The goal is euthanasia, a term with its roots in ancient Greek. . .",
        "[As Rory speaks in the background, Lorelai turns around and sees Christopher in the hallway. A few seconds later, Sherry joins him.]",
        "CUT TO LATER IN THE DEBATE",
        "PARIS: And referencing their last point, which erroneously cited South Carolina as a state that has neither a statute nor common law which prohibits assisted suicide when we know that North Carolina is the proper citation, their subsequent argument falls short of even a level of speciousness due to the fact that it doesn't even have a ring of factual truth, let alone a substance. And after all, the absence of prohibition against assisted suicide is a far cry from a statute that actually legitimizes the practice, a state of affairs that exists only in Oregon, sadly enough, under the 1977 Death Without Dignity Act.",
        "[While Paris is speaking, Sookie tries to subtly look at Sherry, who's sitting towards the back of the audience]",
        "LORELAI: Hey, circus lady, what's with the contortions?",
        "SOOKIE: I'm trying to sneak a peak at the girl Christopher's with.",
        "LORELAI: But you see, the entire concept behind the word sneak is not having people notice you, and what you're doing is shouting \u0091notice me.'",
        "SOOKIE: Tell me you're not curious.",
        "LORELAI: I'm not curious.",
        "SOOKIE: You are too.",
        "LORELAI: We'll meet her in a matter of minutes. Now, come on, watch the tiny shaking boy get shorter.",
        "MRS. O'MALLEY: Two minutes for conclusion.",
        "[Lorelai purposely drops her tissue.]",
        "LORELAI: Ooh. [She leans over to pick it up while glancing back at Sherry]",
        "SOOKIE: You sneak a little peak?",
        "LORELAI: Shh.",
        "PARIS: Professor Bomar of Willamette University of Law has prepared a lengthy summary that I'd like to use in my remaining time.",
        "MRS. O'MALLEY: Time.",
        "PARIS: What?",
        "MRS. O'MALLEY: That's it, time's up.",
        "PARIS: Oh, but if I could just have a few seconds to rebut their charge of the cruelty of the act.",
        "BRAD: We take it back!",
        "PARIS: You can't take it back, it's a debate.",
        "MRS. O'MALLEY: Okay, that's enough cruelty for one day, Paris. Your team has won. Congratulations.",
        "PARIS: Really? Thank you. Thank you very much. [walks over to opposing team] You put up a good fight. Better luck next time.",
        "RORY: You okay?",
        "BRAD: I'm sweating. I'm completely soaked through. And I think I'm catching a cold.",
        "RORY: Do you need a hug? Or a towel?",
        "BRAD: No, thanks. I think I'm just gonna sit here quietly.",
        "[cut to Lorelai and Sookie standing near the doorway]",
        "SOOKIE: Uh! There they are.",
        "LORELAI: I see them. What do you think?",
        "SOOKIE: She's got good hair.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah.",
        "SOOKIE: Plus she's been sitting for an hour and her dress is perfect. Not a wrinkle? How does she do that?",
        "LORELAI: She must be a witch.",
        "SOOKIE: And she's doing that no-hose thing.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah. She's a chic, good hair, wrinkle-free, no-hose-wearing witch.",
        "SOOKIE: You ready?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah.",
        "[they walk towards Christopher and Sherry]",
        "LORELAI: Hi there, you two.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Hey Lorelai. You guys get to meet at last. This is. . .",
        "LORELAI: Sherry.",
        "SHERRY: Nice to finally meet you.",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, I recognized you from your Christmas card.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Which I'm sure you mocked mercilessly.",
        "LORELAI: Did not. Others, yes, but not yours. You guys were cute, and the puppy was cute. [Sookie clears her throat] Hey, this is Sookie.",
        "SHERRY: Nice to meet you.",
        "SOOKIE: Nice to meet you. You have a very smooth dress.",
        "SHERRY: Oh, well thank you. It's the fabric.",
        "SOOKIE: The fabric. Uh huh.",
        "LORELAI: Hm. Uh, Chris, I've told you about Sookie.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Yes you have, the famous Sookie.",
        "SOOKIE: The famous Christopher.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: I hear you're the greatest chef after Alan Ducass.",
        "SOOKIE: After Alan Ducass? Who \u0096 who said after?",
        "RORY: Hi Dad! You came.",
        "CHRISTOPHER: Of course I did.",
        "RORY: Sorry, I'm still getting used to it. I'm glad.",

Um, listen, I just wanted to tell you that Sherry just asked me if she could go out with you tonight just the two of you, and she sort of trapped me into saying that I could get you out of the Friday night dinner, which she knew all about. But I told her she had to run it past you first, so I can still get you out of it. Although, it might be a good idea to get a Sherry night out of the way because it seems kind of inevitable. So if you're okay going with her, just say, um, \u0091Sorry Leonard, we've got company, I have to call you back.'",

And after all, the absence of prohibition against assisted suicide is a far cry from a statute that actually legitimizes the practice, a state of affairs that exists only in Oregon, sadly enough, under the 1977 Death Without Dignity Act."
