        "LUKE'S APARTMENT",
        "[Lorelai comes out of the bathroom. Luke is lying in bed.]",
        "LORELAI: Hey. You built me a shelf. That's so nice.",
        "LUKE: It was anything but nice. I kept using your crazy toothpaste.",
        "LORELAI: There's nothing crazy about my toothpaste.",
        "LUKE: It's cinnamon.",
        "LORELAI: So what?",
        "LUKE: I don't like cinnamon. I like normal flavored.",
        "LORELAI: What exactly is this normal flavor?",
        "LUKE: You know, striped.",
        "LORELAI: Striped. That's not a flavor.",
        "LUKE: It is in the toothpaste world.",
        "LORELAI: Ooo, the toothpaste world. Is that anything like Whoville?",
        "[She joins him in bed.]",
        "LUKE: I'm exhausted.",
        "LORELAI [perky]: I'm exhilarated.",
        "LUKE: You know, you don't have to do this.",
        "LORELAI: Hey. Going to bed early every once in a while is good for ya.",
        "LUKE: I have to get up at four. You don't.",
        "LORELAI: Yes, I know, but every night you have early deliveries is a night we spend apart and seriously, where's the good in that?",
        "LUKE: Okay. [He turns off the light.] 'Night.",
        "[They kiss.]",
        "LORELAI: Night.",
        "[They kiss again. Luke rolls over. Lorelai is sitting up. She looks around, wide awake.]",
        "LORELAI: Man, is it quiet. Do you hear how quiet it is?",
        "LUKE: Mm-hmm.",
        "LORELAI: Do you have a pin, 'cause I want to hear it drop.",
        "LUKE: No pins.",
        "LORELAI: Okay. Sorry. So, okay. Good night. [She leans back, then taps Luke on the shoulder.] Hey, Luke. Why don't you have a T.V.?",
        "LUKE: I have a T.V.",
        "LORELAI: No, I mean, in here, in the bedroom so you can watch T.V. in bed.",
        "LUKE [rolls back over]: I don't watch T.V. in bed. Studies show that it's not good for your sleep.",
        "LORELAI: What studies?",
        "LUKE: Watching T.V. in bed screws up your REM sleep.",
        "LORELAI: But Charlie Rose, Jon Stewart, Pink Lady and Jeff?",
        "LUKE: All screw up your REM sleep.",
        "LORELAI: How does Charlie Rose screw up your REM sleep?",
        "LUKE: Because he's always got some guy on pushing a book about how everything's all going to hell, or they're going to pass a law, how everyone with a nose ring is going to get shipped off to China. Suddenly you're depressed, thinking we're all going to die and don't drink the water, there's anthrax in my bagel - and bam, there goes your REM sleep.",
        "LORELAI: Or Mel Brooks is on, and he is so funny, and you think, \"What a wonderful world we live in, that there's a Mel Brooks to go to sleep to.\"",
        "LUKE: Mel Brooks is never on Charlie Rose, and when he is on he's talking about Nazis, and then you go to sleep and you dream about Nazis and they all look like Nathan Lane, and you're creeped out for days.",
        "LORELAI: You know what ruins your REM sleep, is those articles about REM sleep. And you know what could help you forget those articles about REM sleep?",
        "LUKE: What?",
        "LORELAI: A television.",
        "[Luke opens his eyes.]",
        "LORELAI: Say goodnight, Gracie.",
        "LUKE: Goodnight, Gracie.",
        "[He rolls back over. Lorelai tries to sleep, then pops her eyes open.]",
        "OPENING CREDITS",
        "YALE NEWSROOM",
        "[Rory walks in and heads for her desk. Doyle is in her chair and Paris is sitting on the desk, fanning him.]",
        "RORY: Move butt, please.",
        "PARIS: In a minute.",
        "RORY: What's wrong with Doyle?",
        "PARIS: Mitchum Huntzberger just left.",
        "RORY: Logan's dad?",
        "DOYLE: My entire body is numb.",
        "RORY: What was he doing here?",
        "DOYLE: What was he doing here? Busting my chops, which are now numb. Oh my God, my chops are completely numb!",
        "PARIS: Don't speak, don't speak.",
        "RORY: So Mitchum Huntzberger stopped by just to make various parts of Doyle's body insensate?",
        "PARIS: He's a deep-pocket alumnus. Every few months Yale reels guys like him in for banquets and luncheons.",
        "DOYLE: And he's going to New York to throw some party for Seymour Hersh on Friday night. [To Paris] A little faster? [She obliges.]",
        "RORY: Seymour Hersh? The New Yorker's Seymour Hersh? Wow.",
        "DOYLE: The man owns thirteen newspapers. He's my best contact in the business and I fell like a house of cards. I made that joke about Abu Grab. God, that was inappropriate.",
        "PARIS: It wasn't supposed to be a ha ha, funny Abu Grab joke. Stop beating yourself up.",
        "DOYLE: Then he busted me on the fact that Logan hasn't had a by-line all year, wants me to light a fire under him and get him to write. [In a deeper, serious voice:] \"I'd like to hand the business over to my son, Doyle, so it'd be nice if he knew something about it.\"",
        "PARIS: He's going to pass his empire on to that playboy cad while a rising star such as Doyle is standing right before him.",
        "DOYLE: In a pool of my own sweat. See, it's kind of a minus.",
        "RORY: I'm sure it wasn't that bad.",
        "DOYLE [Stands]: Now I'm Logan's journalistic Godfather, and I can't even get the punk to show up, never mind write a story.",
        "RORY: Do you even know if he can write?",
        "DOYLE: Oh, he can write. He's actually an excellent writer. How's that for God giving with both hands, huh? Every now and then, usually when he gets the flu or the clap, and can't party, he'll throw us a bone and write something. It's always good. Damn good. Stupid b*st*rd.",
        "PARIS: Well, you are his editor, Doyle. Talk to him. Assign him something.",
        "DOYLE: I did. He's supposed to cover the student uproar over Assistant Professor Warrick resigning.",
        "RORY: And?",
        "DOYLE: And he said thank you, left the room, and I heard him laughing all the way down the hall. I haven't seen him here since. [He sits.] I don't know what to do. [Paris starts fanning him again.]",
        "RORY: Um, Doyle, I just finished that piece on the dissatisfaction of the faculty with the tenure system, and I bet a lot of my notes would overlap with Logan's story.",
        "DOYLE: Point, Gilmore, point?",
        "RORY: If you want, I could arrange to get together with Logan. Share my notes with him. Maybe it could get him started.",
        "DOYLE: Really? You'd do that?",
        "RORY: Sure. I mean, if it would help you out.",
        "DOYLE: Gilmore, I am loving you at this moment.",
        "PARIS: Moment's over.",
        "DOYLE: Moment's over. Thanks.",
        "RORY: Sure, boss. Anything for the team.",
        "[Paris is glaring at Doyle. He gestures \"What could I do?\" Paris tosses some files on his desk and stomps away. Doyle sighs, picks up the files and starts fanning himself.]",
        "DRAGONFLY INN - DINING ROOM",
        "[Lorelai is leading a staff meeting. All the employees are sitting facing her.]",
        "LORELAI: Okay, everyone remember your time cards. Punch in, punch out, including lunch and breaks. Okay, now, next on the agenda is something very exciting. The Dragonfly Inn's first official sexual harassment seminar.",
        "MICHEL: Ah, finally. Yes, good, talk to them.",
        "LORELAI: Sexual harassment is bad. So no one touch anyone in any funny places unless specifically asked. Moving on.",
        "MICHEL: That's it? That's the seminar? Where's the speech about people not ogling other people like an object of desire? How about explaining that the way some people walk with a sway or a bounce, it is natural. It is because",
        "we work out, and we take Pilates, and -",
        "LORELAI: No one touch Michel! Moving on. Uh, Billy, Adam, you've got to remember to securely lock the padlock on the stables, not just hook it on. Cletus has figured out how to push it off with his nose, and two days in a row I found him at reception. [She laughs.] Now if you could just check people in, that would be a different story, but - until then, um, lock the stable and check the lock and - Kirk. [She notices Kirk sitting in the back.] What are you doing here?",
        "KIRK: Staff meeting.",
        "LORELAI: You don't work here.",
        "KIRK: I thought I might like to go into hotel management someday, and I figured this was a good place to learn.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, Kirk, you can't just crash a staff meeting.",
        "KIRK [Writing on a clipboard]: \"Outsiders cannot crash staff meetings.\" I'm learning so much.",
        "LORELAI: Okay, anything else to discuss before we wrap it up here?",
        "MICHEL: Yes. [He stands.] We have a problem with some honor bar discrepancies. For the past few weeks after I have checked a room and found the honor bar intact, the next day, Toblerones are missing.",
        "SOOKIE: What?",
        "MICHEL: Only Toblerones, and only in certain rooms. I think we have thieves.",
        "LORELAI: Or guests.",
        "MICHEL: No, these are not the guests. The disappearances are happening in rooms no one is staying in. I think we have thieves and it's obviously an inside job. These people are waiting until I've made my rounds. They're waiting until I've checked my list, 'till I initial my list, and only then do they steal the Toblerones.",
        "LORELAI: Maybe you counted wrong.",
        "MICHEL: I say we install surveillance cameras, fingerprint the staff, run the prints through the FBI and have mandatory searches before they leave at the end of their shift.",
        "LORELAI: Oh, well, that sounds great. Everybody drop your pants for Michel before you leave. Meeting adjourned.",
        "[They all get up and head back to work.]",
        "KIRK: No food spread? The staff meetings at Connecticut Light and Power always have a lovely food spread. Nice bagels, an assortment of schmear. [The staff ignore him.]",
        "LUKE'S DINER",
        "[Lane is busy waiting on tables. Kyon walks in.]",
        "LANE: Hey, Kyon. I'm busy, so quick, what do you got?",
        "KYON: Many things. These come house, Mrs. Kim throw directly in trash.",
        "LANE: My Sam Ash catalogues! What's that smell?",
        "KYON: They landed in old fish and bok choy.",
        "LANE: Figures, what else you got?",
        "[Kyon pulls something out of her bag.]",
        "LANE: My old Madonna t-shirt!",
        "KYON: Mrs. Kim use as rag. Says little horse-face good to scrub scum.",
        "LANE: I wore this, ironically, by the way. I was never into her. Not my thing.",
        "KYON [suspiciously]: Right.",
        "LANE: Anything else, Kyon?",
        "KYON: Overheard conversation. Mrs. Kim having Lunar New Year at her house this year. She expect you to come.",
        "LANE: Oh, she does?",
        "KYON: She says not coming is same as spitting on ancestors and ancestors no like spit.",
        "LANE: Expects me to come. Unbelievable. After she attacks my boyfriend on the street, damning him to the fires of hell and swimming with carnivorous dogs. And now she expects me to smile and curtsey and just go to Lunar New Year dinner like nothing happened. Nice, huh?",
        "KYON: Whoa, I'm not your sounding board. I deliver scoop, you give me Monte Cristo sandwich.",
        "LANE: Fine. Sit over there.",
        "[Lane goes to the table in the other corner, where Zach and Brian are looking at photos.]",
        "ZACH: There are some good ones here.",
        "BRIAN: Definitely.",
        "LANE: Oh, our band pictures! How are they?",
        "BRIAN: They're all good.",
        "ZACH: Except the one of you bending over and looking through your legs.",
        "BRIAN: I was just seeing what works.",
        "ZACH: I like this one.",
        "BRIAN: A tree's covering my face.",
        "ZACH: Come on, dude, the good of the many.",
        "BRIAN: What do you like, Lane?",
        "LANE: I don't like any of them.",
        "ZACH: What?",
        "LANE: You guys look good, I mean, not the Brian with his face between his legs one, or the profile one where you've got your finger in your mouth and the peek-a-boo look -",
        "ZACH: Right, peek-a-boo! That's what it is.",
        "BRIAN: I was experimenting.",
        "LANE: But I don't look good.",
        "ZACH: What are you talking about? [He grabs the photo.] You look totally cool, like a real chick.",
        "LANE: I look like the Korean Buddy Holly.",
        "BRIAN: Buddy Holly was cool.",
        "LANE: May he rest in peace, but Buddy Holly was not an attractive man.",
        "BRIAN: I find him attractive.",
        "ZACH: Dude, don't say every thought out loud.",
        "LANE: Can we re-take them?",
        "ZACH: Like thirty-seven dollars just grows on trees?",
        "BRIAN: You're being too hard on yourself.",
        "ZACH: Totally. Lame. We're not Maroon 5 or the Gee Whiz Slicky Boys. We don't want to look all fake.",
        "LANE: No, but halfway decent would be nice.",
        "ZACH: Lighten up. They work.",
        "CUSTOMER: Miss, some more coffee, please?",
        "LANE: At least she didn't say mister.",
        "ELDER GILMORE HOUSE - DINING ROOM",
        "[Richard and Emily are sitting opposite from each other, going through paperwork.]",
        "EMILY: The lease on my Mercedes is up next month.",
        "RICHARD: Do you want to buy it?",
        "EMILY: I finally have the seat setting where I like it.",
        "RICHARD [chuckling]: I'll make the arrangements tomorrow.",
        "EMILY: Thank you, Richard.",
        "RICHARD: Now, uh, we need to schedule work on the water heater. Um, I was wondering if Friday morning would work for you?",
        "EMILY: Let me look.",
        "RICHARD: They estimate the work to be about an hour, which means they'll be done in June.",
        "EMILY: Oh, no, I have a hair appointment Friday morning.",
        "RICHARD: For what?",
        "EMILY [smiling]: What do you mean for what?",
        "RICHARD: Your hair looks perfect to me.",
        "EMILY: Oh, now.",
        "RICHARD: Well, I can arrange for Robert to let the workman in and supervise it if that works for you.",
        "EMILY: Well, that would be fine. Thank you, Richard.",
        "RICHARD: You're welcome, Emily. What's next on the agenda?",
        "EMILY: The Modern Museum gala is coming up.",
        "RICHARD: Oh, yes. Martin Forman is being honored this year.",
        "EMILY: And Sugar Farthington is organizing it.",
        "RICHARD: Well, if Sugar's organizing it, then of course you should go.",
        "EMILY: Well, if Martin's being honored, then you should go.",
        "RICHARD: Sugar is one of your closest friends.",
        "EMILY: Martin is one of your most trusted colleagues.",
        "RICHARD: Well, then, perhaps we should both attend.",
        "EMILY: That does seem to be the sensible thing to do.",
        "RICHARD: All right. Then we'll both attend.",
        "EMILY [smiling]: Fine.",
        "RICHARD: Uh, so, have we discussed the water heater?",
        "EMILY: Yes, we have.",
        "RICHARD: Ah. More water?",
        "[Emily nods. Richard gets up to re-fill her glass.]",

        "[Rory is drinking coffee, waiting for Logan to arrive. Her table is piled with file folders. Logan pushes his way through a crowd.]",
        "LOGAN: Hey, Ace.",
        "RORY: Hi, Logan. I didn't see you there. Hey. Um, how are you?",
        "LOGAN: I'm good.",
        "RORY: Oh, good. Good. Okay, so good. Um, here they are.",
        "LOGAN: These are the notes for one story?",
        "RORY: Yeah, I'm kind of a note freak.",
        "LOGAN [sitting]: Man, Ace, I'm impressed and partially terrified.",
        "RORY: Okay. Well, I've divided them up into sections, so [pointing] interviews, research, statistics. I wasn't sure what you already had, but I figured there's something here that can help you with your story.",
        "LOGAN: I hope you're getting extra credit for this.",
        "RORY: Oh, it's nothing.",
        "LOGAN: Seems like a lot of work on your part, going through this stuff, organizing it for me.",
        "RORY: Well, I'm kind of an organization freak, too.",
        "LOGAN: Plus, I'm sure it wasn't your idea to give up your evening like this, to come here and meet me. Was it?",
        "RORY: Um, I'm just doing a little public service. That's all.",
        "LOGAN: Public service?",
        "RORY: Yes. Doyle looked like he was about to liquefy after your dad talked to him, so I chose to stop that from happening, for the sake of the janitorial staff.",
        "LOGAN: Yeah. He has a thing for by-lines, my father.",
        "RORY: Apparently he has plans for you.",
        "LOGAN: Yes. Isn't that thrilling. Sorry Doyle took the hit. My dad can be a real bully when he wants to be.",
        "RORY: He's a very interesting man.",
        "LOGAN: You met him?",
        "RORY: No, I've just... read about him. I mean, he's a big guy.",
        "LOGAN: Maybe you'll get to meet him someday.",
        "RORY [nods]: Oh, did I show you how I divided these up? Interviews, research, um -",
        "LOGAN: So how come I never see you around?",
        "RORY: I'm around.",
        "LOGAN: Yeah? Where?",
        "RORY: Class, coffee cart, the student's store when I run out of thumbtacks...",
        "LOGAN: Wow, thrilling life.",
        "RORY: I'm really not that boring.",
        "LOGAN: Oh, I know you're not boring.",
        "RORY: Oh, Doyle told me that your dad is throwing a party for Seymour Hersh?",
        "LOGAN: Ah, you want to talk about boring?",
        "RORY: How can meeting Seymour Hersh be boring? I love him. I read My Lai Four when I was twelve and I've been obsessed with him ever since.",
        "LOGAN: You read a book about the My Lai massacre when you were twelve?",
        "RORY: Well, I polished off Nancy Drew that year too.",
        "LOGAN: Well, I guarantee, these parties always turn into a bunch of drunks discussing stocks, cars and the latest friends to be indicted. It's boring. I just go, take a date so I have somebody to talk to, and bail as soon as my dad's back is turned.",
        "RORY: Oh, so you're going?",
        "LOGAN: Daddy says.",
        "RORY: Wow, lucky.",
        "LOGAN: No.",
        "RORY: To spend the evening with a great writer, and to get to meet him, hear him talk? Very, very lucky.",
        "LOGAN: You think so?",
        "RORY: Definitely.",
        "LOGAN: Well, maybe this time it won't be so bad after all. [A pause; Rory looks uncomfortable.] So, do you want to get something to drink or do you have to go?",
        "RORY: No, I don't have to go. I don't have anywhere to go.",
        "LOGAN: Okay. Be right back.",

        "LANE: Hi, Lorelai.",
        "LORELAI: Hmm. You look different.",
        "LANE: I do?",
        "LORELAI: Yeah, you look cute. I mean, you always look cute, but this is just a new facet of your cuteness.",
        "LANE: Thanks. You look cute too.",
        "LORELAI: I have a boyfriend, so maybe this flirting thing we've got going on should just end here.",
        "LANE: Coffee to go?",
        "LORELAI: It's that special time of day.",
        "[We hear Luke getting frustrated in the back.]",
        "LORELAI: What was that?",
        "LANE: It's been like that for an hour. It's the damn oven.",
        "LORELAI: The damn oven?",
        "LUKE [OS]: Damn oven!",
        "LORELAI: What's up with the damn oven?",
        "LUKE: I bought this damn oven and the thermostat doesn't work!",
        "LORELAI: The damn thermostat or just the thermostat?",
        "LUKE: Are you being cute?",
        "LORELAI: Sorry, go on!",
        "LUKE: So I went and I got a new thermostat, and now I can't figure out how to replace the damn thing.",
        "LORELAI: So it is a damn thermostat.",
        "LUKE: I don't have time for this.",
        "LORELAI: Come on! You can do this. [Luke roars at it.] Step at a time here. You pulled the knob off each gas tap on the range, right?",
        "LUKE [OS]: Uh, yeah. So?",
        "LORELAI: Then you remove the four screws securing the face panel, then you remove the panel.",
        "LUKE [OS]: Yeah, I did that.",
        "LORELAI: Hmm. Then you disconnect the oven and gas supply pipe from the outlet of the thermostat?",
        "LUKE [OS]: This is where I got stuck.",
        "LORELAI [nodding]: Did you release the oven sensor retaining clips from the oven lining?",
        "LUKE [OS]: No. No, I didn't. [Pause] Okay! Got it!",
        "LORELAI: Now just pull the sensor out, you should be rolling now.",
        "LUKE [coming out from the kitchen, amazed]: So how, how?",
        "LORELAI: How what?",
        "LUKE: How do you know this?",
        "LORELAI: Well, I couldn't get to sleep the other night, you know, when we went to bed, and so I read your oven manual.",
        "LUKE: You're kidding.",
        "LORELAI: Well, it was either that or the broiler manual, and the oven won, 'cause it's shiny and pretty.",
        "LUKE: You never cease to amaze me.",
        "LORELAI: And I never will. Bye, Doll. [They kiss] And hey, leave the broiler manual out for me. I'm kind of into this whole kitchen appliance genre now, you know? \"Kitch lit\".",
        "LUKE: All right.",
        "[She exits as Zach is on his way in.]",
        "LORELAI: Hey there, Zach.",
        "ZACH: Howdy.",
        "LANE: Hi there.",
        "ZACH: Well, aren't we bouncy?",
        "[They kiss]",
        "LANE: I'm in a pretty good mood.",

        "SOOKIE: I know. I'll go home right now and tell him.",
        "LORELAI: Okay.",
        "SOOKIE: Of course, it's the episode where Barnabas kidnaps Maggie.",
        "LORELAI: And imprisons her in a coffin in the mausoleum's secret room in punishment for disobeying him?",

        "RICHARD: Fine. I found out about it in a business meeting, which was hardly the time to find out about it, but fine.",
        "EMILY: It was dinner.",
        "RICHARD: Dinner. Of course.",
        "EMILY: Nothing happened.",

        "EMILY: Stop it, Richard. I wouldn't say it if it wasn't true.",
        "RICHARD: Well, I told you that nothing happened between me and Pennilyn Lott. That all we did was have lunch. And I wouldn't have said that if that weren't true!",

        "RICHARD: Right. [On the phone.] I'm afraid the Gold Room won't do. We need the Rose Room. [Pause] Well, perhaps they'd be willing to switch dates. We'd certainly be happy to make it worth their while. Of course, I'll hold.",
        "EMILY: Richard, we just have to get the Rose Room.",

Clark Gable never knew what he was missing. [laughs] He was a cad, but the crease in his pants was immaculate. [She emerges from the closet and gasps.] Oh, my God! It's Natalie Wood.",
        "LORELAI: Hello, Miss Celine. You look wonderful.",

        "EMILY: I'll try them both. [She takes them into the dressing room.]",
        "CELINE: You'll try them all. I had the worst row with Dietrich once. I told her, \"Marlene, until you actually become a man you must try dresses on like a woman.\" And that means all of them.",

        "CELINE: Are you married, Natalie?",
        "LORELAI: Oh, no, not yet.",

        "CELINE: When I was dressing Marilyn for her wedding to Arthur Miller, I told her, I said, \"Marilyn! Wear a flat hat on your head. It will remind him of a book.\" She didn't, and we all saw how that turned out.",

        "LUKE: That was not manicotti, it was square and flat and blue.",
        "LORELAI [OS]: Yeah. Manicotti's rarely blue.",
        "[Lorelai comes out of the bathroom.]",
        "LUKE: You know, I've been thinking, uh, maybe I shouldn't go to this thing of your parents'.",

        "LUKE: I'm serious. I'm not really their favorite person. They don't really want me there.",
        "LORELAI: Hey, I'm not their favorite person either, and I still have to go.",
        "LUKE: I know, it's just - it's going to be this big fancy thing with all their friends. And, you know, I just -",
        "LORELAI: Listen. My parents are very weird people. They don't hate you. They just don't know you. This is the perfect opportunity. They'll be happy. They'll be smashed. You show up, shake some hands, get in a few family pictures, and before you know it my mother will be trying to convince you you're too good for me. [Luke sighs.] Come on, it'll be fun. Good food. Open bar. I'm wearing a fabulous dress and as maid of honor, if you're not there, I'll have to get drunk and make out with the best man. Who is Rory. So you can see all the creepy ramifications of your absence here.",
        "LUKE: Okay.",
        "LORELAI: Okay? [Luke nods.] Okay. [She gasps, seeing the T.V.] Hey! You got a T.V.!",
        "LUKE: Oh. Yeah.",
        "LORELAI: Since when did you get a T.V.?",
        "LUKE: I just picked it up this morning.",
        "LORELAI: What about your REM sleep?",
        "LUKE: Hey, twice a week you're going to bed at 9:30 like a 72-year-old woman because I have early deliveries, so I figured the least I could do is make sure you don't miss your Charlie Rose or your Patrick Stewart -",
        "LORELAI: Jon Stewart.",
        "LUKE: And plus, I can sleep through anything. Once I'm out, I'm out.",

        "CHRIS: Yes, this is Georgia. We call her Gigi.",
        "EMILY: And her mother's still gone?",
        "CHRIS: Yes. She's in Paris.",
        "EMILY: All right. I'll come straight to the point, Christopher. Now, I have known you a long time. I watched you grow up. You were a charming boy. A weak, but charming boy. And to be completely honest, I never thought much of you. I still don't.",
        "CHRIS: Wow. That's great of you to come by and share that with me.",
        "EMILY: However, you have good breeding. You come from an impeccable and you love Lorelai. You've always loved Lorelai. You would've married her when she got pregnant. I know that. And you would have married her if that girlfriend of yours hadn't gotten pregnant with this. [She gestures at Gigi.] I know that too. Lorelai's in a relationship now, did you know that?",
        "CHRIS: Yes, I know that.",
        "EMILY: He owns a diner. He's a divorcee. He's uneducated, he's not a proper stepfather for Rory and he's completely unsuitable for Lorelai. My daughter is stubborn, but she's capable of greatness. And watching her settle down with a man who could hold her back from that is unacceptable. You, at least, won't hold her back.",
        "CHRIS: Okay, Emily, I'm very confused by this speech of yours, and Gigi needs to be fed.",
        "EMILY: She's getting serious with this man. I've seen it with my own eyes. If you want a chance with Lorelai you had better do something. And you had better do something now. [She places an envelope on the table.] Timing has never been your strong point, Christopher. You should see if you can change that. Goodbye, Gigi. Enjoy your program.",
