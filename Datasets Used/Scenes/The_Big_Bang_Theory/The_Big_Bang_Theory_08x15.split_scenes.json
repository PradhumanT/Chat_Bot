    "Recap": [
        "Barry Kripke stops by to thank Amy for helping him with her ideas on string theory, which bothers Sheldon because she never helped him out when he was working on it. He complains to Penny who tells him to \"let it go\". Instead, Sheldon reveals that Amy was secretly performing experiments on Penny and Leonard and comparing the results with those of a chimpanzee, infuriating Penny. Leonard and Raj run into Nathan Fillion at a deli, but he denies he is an actor so he can eat in peace. Later, he admits who he is and offers to take a picture with them. Raj, who now doubts whether he is the real Nathan Fillion, asks questions to verify his identity and annoys him. Stuart has opened his newly-renovated comic book store, which impresses everyone except Howard who finds him using some of his mother's furniture. However, all arguments end when Howard gets a call from Florida where his mother is visiting, and receives news that she died in her sleep. Everyone, including Sheldon who knows how it feels to lose a family member, goes to comfort Howard. After he and Bernadette leave for Florida, the rest of the gang remember and toast Mrs. Wolowitz, with Leonard calling her \"a loving mother to all of us\"."

        "Amy: How many?",
        "Sheldon: Who cares? He stole the idea and doesn't deserve his own joke.",
        "Amy: Is that really true?",
        "Sheldon: Of course, that's how you know it's a good joke. It not only entertains, it informs.",

        "Sheldon: What do you want, Barry?",
        "Barry: Just wanted to dwop this off as a wittle thank you for Amy.",
        "Amy: What's this for?",
        "Barry: Your idea weawy hewped me out. My wight-cone quantization paper's onwine alweady. The wesponse has been amazing.",
        "Amy: Well, that's fascinating. I can't wait to read it.",
        "Sheldon: Oh, no, me as well. Uh, please e-mail it to Sheldon at bazinga dot biz. Why dot biz? Because I just gave you the business. And also bazinga dot com was taken.",
        "Barry: Anyway, thanks again. Cooper, suck eggs.",
        "Sheldon: Since when do you help out Barry Kripke?",
        "Amy: Well, I'd been thinking about a cellular automata approach to neuronal connectivity, and I thought it might have some interesting applications to string theory, it's not a big deal.",
        "Sheldon: Oh, really? When I was doing string theory and hit a dead end, why didn't you try to help me?",
        "Amy: I did. You said the only math biologists know is if you have three frogs and one hops away, that leaves two frogs.",
        "Sheldon: That's pretty funny, that does sound like me. But that doesn't mean that you should be standing on street corners handing out your math to whatever guy comes along.",
        "Amy: Sheldon, we're all scientists. I helped out a fellow colleague. You're being petty.",
        "Sheldon: I'm being petty? You know Barry and I have a professional rivalry. You heard him, he told me to suck eggs. If we were friends, he would have suggested I suck something more pleasant. Why are you laughing? Did you learn something?",

        "Sheldon: I'm mad at Amy.",
        "Penny: Did she leave pit stains in your favourite crop top, too?",
        "Sheldon: No. She helped Barry Kripke make an advancement in string theory.",
        "Penny: Oh, that sounds like a good thing.",
        "Sheldon: Well, it would be, except that I left string theory because I decided it was a dead end. Yeah, and then she went behind my back to help someone else prove me wrong. My rival, no less. I'm sorry you had to see that.",
        "Penny: I'm sorry I didn't have a camera.",
        "Sheldon: Why would she do this to me?",
        "Penny: Well, I'm sure she didn't upset you on purpose. Besides, aren't you the one who says there's nothing more important than the advancement of science?",
        "Sheldon: No, I said there's nothing more important than me advancing science.",
        "Penny: All right, well, if I'm understanding this right, and all she did was help out another scientist, I'm thinking you might have to let this one go.",
        "Sheldon: Ugh, let it go. I have heard that my whole life. Every time something upsets me somebody says, let it go, you know, like it's my fault, and it's not okay to feel the way I feel.",
        "Penny: I don't know what to tell you. I mean, why don't you talk to her?",

        "Penny: Why would she even do this?",
        "Sheldon: She's been conducting an experiment on apes where they're given various puzzles to solve. I was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles and thought some humans wouldn't be able to solve them. That's when Amy said, want to make this interesting?",
        "Penny: Make this interesting? You bet money on me?",
        "Sheldon: No, no. We designed an experiment involving you. See? Now, isn't that interesting?",
        "Penny: It's not interesting. It's incredibly insulting.",
        "Sheldon: Okay, maybe this will help. Imagine you're holding a pen. Before you go too far, not a special pen with your initials engraved on it, that'll make the next part really hard.",

        "Bernadette: Howie, if the store succeeds, Stuart has a source of income, and he can move out of your mother's house. Seems like some old furniture is a reasonable price to pay for that.",
