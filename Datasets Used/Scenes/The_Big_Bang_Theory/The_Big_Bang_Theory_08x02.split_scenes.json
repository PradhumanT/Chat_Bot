    "Recap": [
        "Sheldon is allowed to study what he wants in exchange for becoming a junior professor and teaching a class; he is not happy, and nobody signs up for his class because of his reputation. Howard decides to take the class to work on a doctorate, but Sheldon focuses on areas of physics that Howard does not understand to humiliate him. Howard gets him back by being a horrible student leading to an incident where he shoots a spitball into Sheldon's mouth, causing him to be reported to Human Resources. After dropping the class, Howard asks Sheldon engineering questions most of which Sheldon answers apart from one difficult one he is forced to admit he doesn't know. The men eventually heal by celebrating their own genius, and asking each other questions. Meanwhile, Bernadette feels Penny should start studying for her pharmaceutical job, but Penny wants to wait since she will undergo training anyway which leads to tension. Amy loves being in the middle, pretending to agree with both of them. Now she can spend time with each one alone, and increase her bond of friendship by trash talking about the other woman and feeling immensely popular. Her good times are short-lived when Bernadette and Penny study and apologize to each other, and Amy ends up eavesdropping on her friends to see if they are getting along."

        "Sheldon: That's the one. I believe you went last, so, uh, please?",
        "Mrs Davis: Dr. Cooper, while you were away, we came up with a solution that would allow you to change your field of study.",
        "Sheldon: Wow. Pouting and running away actually worked. I must say, that may not be a lesson you want to reinforce with me. So, um, what is the solution?",
        "Mrs Davis: Currently, you're being paid under a grant to specifically research string theory. If we promote you to junior professor, you'll be able to choose whatever field of research you'd like.",
        "Sheldon: But if I'm a professor, then I'll have to teach a class.",
        "Mrs Davis: That is correct.",
        "Sheldon: So your solution is to promote me and pay me more money so that I can impart my knowledge to the next generation of scientists?",

        "Sheldon: Awful. They're allowing me to move on from string theory, but they made me a junior professor and are requiring me to teach a class.",
        "Raj: I don't understand. Why is it bad that you have to teach?",
        "Sheldon: What a stupid question.",

And then after someone said Newton, I was going to tell them they're wrong. The cookies are named after a town in Massachusetts. And then I'd throw the cookies away.",

        "Howard: Since every interpretation gives exactly the same answer to every measurement, they are all equally correct. However, I know you believe in the Many Worlds Interpretation, so I'll say that. Now do you think I'm smart enough?",
        "Sheldon: No.",
        "Howard: Oh, come on. You might've gone to school for a couple more years than me, but guess what, engineers are just as smart as physicists.",
