    "Recap": [
        "Sheldon meets the middle-aged Dr. Lorvis who tracked down a flirty pharmaceutical sales rep, Penny. Leonard explains to him that Penny is his fianc\u00e9e, so he walks away looking sad realizing that Penny only flirts with him for sales. Sheldon invites him inside for a hot beverage. When Penny gets wind of this, she asks Leonard to get rid of him as she cannot communicate with her clients outside of work. Lorvis turns out to be a celebrity urinary specialist with a huge sci-fi memorabilia collection which he invites the men to see. Earlier, Bernadette tells the girls that she has been picked as one of the fifty most beautiful scientists for an article in a magazine. The magazine cancels the article because Amy wrote an email of complaint about the article since they would not have written about handsome male scientists and are objectifying women. Bernadette claims Amy is jealous because she cannot express her sexuality, causing a hurt Amy to storm out. After Sheldon teases that the Penny-Leonard relationship is doomed to fail, Lorvis locks them in his basement to go after Penny again, but at the staircase, he meets Amy and falls in love with her, confusing Penny. When he reveals he locked the men in his basement, Penny proceeds to call him out on his actions as he is acting creepy, and cannot chase every woman that is nice to him. When Leonard realizes that the men are locked in and calls Penny, she and Amy urge Lorvis to help them get the men out; he meets Bernadette, who wants to apologize to Amy, and falls in love with her, too. The women go back to Lorvis' house only to find the men are too busy playing Donkey Kong to notice. To pass the time, Lorvis proceeds to show the women his memorabilia."

        "Amy: I'm studying one-celled organisms to try and find the neurochemicals that lead to the feeling of shame.",
        "Bernadette: What would a one-celled organism have to be embarrassed about?",
        "Penny: Same as all of us, getting out of a car without underwear.",
        "Bermadette: Speaking of underwear, I have some interesting news.",
        "Penny: Okay, if it's sometimes Howie wears yours, Leonard already told us.",
        "Bernadette: He was being funny. I'm pretty sure. Anyway, I was asked to be a part of a magazine article about the 50 sexiest female scientists in California. Isn't that cool?",
        "Amy: I think it's awful.",
        "Penny: Why would you say that?",
        "Amy: Bernadette is a successful microbiologist. She should be celebrated for her achievements, not her looks. I mean, what kind of message does that send?",
        "Penny: I think the message is check out the rack on that scientist.",
        "Bernadette: Why can't someone be thought of as both smart and pretty?",
        "Amy: I just don't think a professional woman should have to flaunt her sexuality in order to get ahead.",
        "Penny: Okay, what's the big deal? Look, if it helps me make a sale with a physician, I don't think it hurts to flirt a little. I mean, laugh at their joke, touch their arm, maybe crank up the AC in the car beforehand, you know, to wake up the girls.",
        "Amy: Maybe it's different in the world of sales, but it's already hard enough for women to be taken seriously in science.",
        "Bernadette: I was kind of excited about the article, but now you're making me feel bad.",
        "Penny: No, I think you should do whatever you want. You know, maybe if fashion magazines had female scientists in them, I would've become a theoretical physicist. Stop smirking at each other.",

        "Sheldon: Yeah, I bet you leave your patients in stitches. That was also humorous.",

        "Sheldon: Hmm. You know, they have delivery people that will do that for you.",
        "Man: I was hoping to impress her by tracking her down on the Internet and then showing up unannounced at her door.",

        "Leonard: No, but you can have mine.",
        "Sheldon: Eh, well, very well. Oh, and on the topic of sharing things that are yours, there is a gentleman caller bringing flowers to your fianc\u00e9e as we speak.",
        "Leonard: What? Why didn't you say that first?",
        "Sheldon: Why didn't you get extra peanut sauce? We can both play this game.",

        "Leonard: Okay, um, look, I'm pretty sure she didn't wink at you.",
        "Man: Oh, she did. Seductively, like this. And then she touched my arm for two Mississippis. Like, you know, one Mississippi, two...",
        "Leonard: I got it, I got it. Listen, um, I think there's been a misunderstanding. See, Penny is my fianc\u00e9e.",
        "Man: Really? I've never seen her wear an engagement ring.",
        "Raj: Really?",
        "Man: So, am I to presume that her flirtation was just a sales technique?",
        "Leonard: I think so.",
        "Man: When will I learn? It's just like the cute girl at the pet store all over again.",
        "Leonard: Excuse me?",

        "Leonard: Thank you. Sorry.",
        "Man: Oh, uh, you probably don't want her to see this. It's unnecessarily graphic.",

        "Bernadette: It was fine, but you'll be happy to know they pulled the sexy scientists article.",
        "Amy: What happened?",
        "Bernadette: I don't know. They just canceled the photo shoot and said they're rethinking it.",
        "Amy: Well, I'm really sorry, but I think it's for the best. You want people focusing on your achievements, not staring at your breasts in some magazine.",
        "Bernadette: I guess. It's really not that important. Hey, up here.",
        "Amy: Sorry, it's just we're, we were talking about them. So, look, I, I wasn't going to say anything, but since you seem to be okay with the article being canceled, I have a little confession. I'm the reason it was pulled.",
        "Bernadette: What? How?",
        "Amy: I sent the editors of the magazine a pretty scathing e-mail.",
        "Bernadette: Amy, what did you say?",
        "Amy: I simply pointed out that they would never consider doing an article ranking male scientists on their sexuality, let alone showing them in various stages of undress.",
        "Bernadette: Because no one wants to see Neil deGrasse Tyson in a wet T-shirt, bent over the hood of a Porsche.",
        "Amy: Well, it doesn't make a difference, because they agreed it was in bad taste, and now you agree, so Amy saves the day.",
        "Bernadette: No, what happened was you got jealous, so you took away a chance for me to get some publicity.",
        "Amy: But it was bad publicity.",
        "Bernadette: That's for me to decide, not you.",
        "Amy: I disagree. As a female scientist, I think what you do affects all of us.",
        "Bernadette: And I think you don't like people expressing their sexuality because no one wants you to express yours. Oh, Amy, I'm so sorry. That was over the line.",

        "Man: Well, he said it was a tribble. It could be a toupee, but either way, it's pretty cool.",
        "Raj: I would love to see your collection.",
        "Man: Anytime. Uh, I've got some cool stuff. When I first started, I thought it would be a good way to meet women, but, well, you know.",
        "Howard: We know.",

        "Leonard: Oh. Well, you know, just being myself, really.",
        "Sheldon: Oh, please, you know, I'll tell you how he did it. Implacable, relentless badgering. In urology terms, he was a drug-resistant staph infection. And she was a urethra that could not shake him.",
        "Leonard: I don't know that I'd call myself an infection.",
        "Howard: A gallant man would defend his fianc\u00e9e for being called a urethra.",

        "Dr Lorvis: Uh, well, actually I came to see you.",
        "Penny: Really? Why?",
        "Leonard: Ah, that's a good question. Apparently someone was being awfully flirty while not wearing their engagement ring, causing another someone to show up here thinking the first someone might be available.",
        "Sheldon: Oh, God. Don't make it so hard on her. Look, the first someone is the deceitful you. The second someone is the delightful Dr. Lorvis.",
        "Penny: Oh, this is very embarrassing. Dr. Lorvis, I am so sorry. I did not mean to lead you on.",
        "Dr Lorvis: You touched my arm for two Mississippis.",
        "Penny: Oh. That's why you were mumbling Mississippi.",

        "Sheldon: So what other celebrity genitalia have you handled?",
        "Leonard: So, uh, what's the deal? You take off your ring when you go to work?",
        "Penny: What? No, no, I just put it on the other hand and turn it around. Keep that hand in my pocket.",
        "Leonard: Why?",
        "Penny: Well, what do you mean why? Look, I make more sales if these doctors think I'm single. I did the same kind of thing as a waitress. The real question is, what is he doing in your apartment?",
        "Leonard: Oh, he was upset. So Sheldon invited him in for a hot beverage.",
        "Penny: You were okay with that?",
        "Leonard: No. I got upset. And Sheldon made me a beverage, too.",
        "Penny: Okay, he just showed up at my door. Don't you think that's a little weird?",
        "Leonard: A little, but he's basically harmless. He's actually kind of a nice guy.",
        "Penny: Okay. Whatever, look, my company does not allow me to socialize with doctors outside of work. You got to get rid of him.",
        "Leonard: Why am I the one that has to get rid of him?",
        "Penny: I can't do it, he's my best client.",

        "Dr Lorvis: So, I've noticed Leonard gets teased a lot 0about his relationship with Penny.",
        "Sheldon: Yes. If you'd like to join in, the premise is their love seems unlikely and doomed to failure.",
