    "Recap": [
        "After Penny gets a company car, she sells the one that Leonard gave her months ago and gives him the money. It bothers Leonard and leads to a conflict between the two. They later share a dinner with Howard and Bernadette to seek their counsel on marriage and finances, but this in turn leads to an argument between Bernadette and Howard over money since Bernadette earns more than Howard. Leonard and Penny decide to use it as an example of what not to do in their marriage and finish having sex on the money. Bernadette and Howard eventually make up as well. Raj and Sheldon see a chance to study dark matter by participating in experiments conducted in a salt mine. To test themselves, they crawl into a hot, sweaty steam pipe tunnel in the university basement with Amy waiting above ground. Sheldon fights several phobias including fear of enclosed places. He also reveals his fear that his new research will fail him like string theory did. Raj consoles him by relating his own fear when he first left India. When some rats show up, a panicked Sheldon quickly abandons Raj, who later excoriates Sheldon for doing so. Their simulation lasts eleven minutes, longer than Amy's estimates."

        "Howard: How does it feel knowing your fianc\u00e9e's job is to go out and flirt with doctors, looking like that, while you sit here, you know, looking like this?",
        "Leonard: She doesn't flirt with doctors.",
        "Penny: Yeah. It's all very professional.",
        "Amy: You know when you bend over, I can see down your shirt?",
        "Penny: Okay, good.",
        "Bernadette: Speaking of new careers, how are things going with dark matter, Sheldon?",
        "Sheldon: Oh, yeah, I'd have to say it's the most exiting time in the history of the field.",
        "Bernadette: Oh. What's going on?",
        "Sheldon: I started doing it.",
        "Raj: You know, the government funded the biggest experiment yet to detect dark matter.",
        "Leonard: Yeah, I've read about that, they're sending research teams down into abandoned salt mines.",
        "Raj: You know, Sheldon, if we apply to be one of those teams, we could be on the ground floor of something big, not just for theoretical physics but for astrophysics as well.",
        "Penny: Wait, hang on, you guys are gonna work in a mine?",
        "Sheldon: Why not?",
        "Penny: You had a panic attack when we went through the car wash.",
        "Sheldon: Perhaps the emotion you're referring to was shock at you having something cleaned.",
        "Leonard: I think what Penny meant is, the thought of you two in a mine is kind of funny, it's like a cat riding a Roomba.",
        "Howard:If they get scared, they'll have those hats with the lights on them, 'cause down there it's night-night all the time.",
        "Bernadette: Maybe they could ride around in one of those mine carts that go (squeakily) ee-oo-ee-oo-ee-oo.",
        "Leonard: Yeah, it'll help them get away when they see a g-g-ghost. Sheldon:Are they making fun of us?",

        "Leonard: So, one of my favourite video games of all time is called Shadow of the Colossus, and it was only for PlayStation 2, but then they came out with a new version for PS3 with better graphics. I finally got the chance to play it, and for some reason, it just wasn't as good as the first one. Or something about yoga.",
        "Penny: I'm sorry, I was thinking about work.",
        "Leonard: Well, I was just saying that there was this video game...",
        "Penny: Yeah, that's when I started thinking about work. Uh, listen, I've got some good news.",
        "Leonard: Hmm.",
        "Penny: This is for you.",
        "Leonard: Huh. What is this?",
        "Penny: Well, you know how they gave me the company car? Didn't make sense to have two, so I sold the other one.",
        "Leonard: The one I gave you?",
        "Penny: Yeah. And there's your money back, and now we're even. How great is that?",
        "Leonard: Uh, yeah.",
        "Penny: What?",
        "Leonard: Nothing.",
        "Penny: Oh, come on, Leonard, I know the car was a thoughtful gesture and I really appreciate it, but it doesn't make sense to have both.",
        "Leonard: You're right.",
        "Penny: What should I have done? Taken a picture of us in the car and put it in a pink frame with puffy paint around it that says best fianc\u00e9 ever?",
        "Leonard: Doesn't sound that bad.",
        "Penny: Well, good, because that's what I did.",
        "Leonard: Aw, oh, thank you. That is so sweet.",
        "Penny: Well, it's not that sweet, I paid for the frame with your money and then got a massage.",
        "Leonard: You know what, you don't have to give me this. You keep it.",
        "Penny: Why?",
        "Leonard: The car was a gift, it was something you needed. I was happy to help you out.",
        "Penny: And I really appreciate it, but now I don't need it, so here you go.",
        "Leonard: Well, this is silly, so you don't need the car, but you could use it to buy yourself something else, like a new purse to put all this money in.",
        "Penny: Sweetie, I can buy my own stuff. I have a good job now.",
        "Leonard: I know, and I'm proud of you, but that doesn't mean I can't do something nice. Like this.",
        "Penny: Okay, I don't want this to turn into a fight.",
        "Leonard: I don't, either.",
        "Penny: Great. Thank you. Can you pass the salt, please?",

        "Raj: Don't they lay eggs on a rock?",
        "Sheldon: Now I've got room for another thing. What do you want?",
        "Raj: So, I did a little research on what the conditions are like in the mines, and the guys might be right, sounds pretty rough down there. For starters, it's very humid, and about a hundred degrees.",
        "Sheldon: Well, I'm from Texas and you're from India, we're no strangers to the fragrant armpit. Next.",
        "Raj: It's also a live mine, so there'll be dynamite explosions going off in the distance.",
        "Sheldon: Yeah, I have a lactose intolerant roommate with a taste for ice cream. Next.",
        "Raj: Oh, you have to be down there for 12 hours at a time.",
        "Sheldon: Yeah? We have to be somewhere.",
        "Raj: Well, there's no toilets, we'll have to do our business in a bucket.",
        "Sheldon: So it's settled, we're not doing it.",
        "Raj: Look, I get it, but before we pass up on an incredible opportunity, I was thinking about when Howard was training to go to space, they put him in a simulated environment.",
        "Sheldon: Interesting. You're suggesting that we recreate the conditions of the mine to see if we can handle it.",
        "Raj: Exactly.",
        "Sheldon: Very well.",
        "Raj: So where should we do it?",

        "Leonard: No, no, no, no, hear me out. I know things got a little weird last night.",
        "Penny: Well, leaving an envelope full of cash on my dresser after s*x would count as weird.",
        "Leonard: Well, I think I came up with a pretty good solution.",
        "Penny: Mm.",
        "Leonard: Why don't we just put the money in a joint account? It'll be our first money together. We can use it for the wedding, the honeymoon, whatever.",
        "Penny: You know what, that's great. I love that.",
        "Leonard: Yeah, of course you do, I'm not just a genius in bed. You sure are, baby.",

        "Penny: Oh, thank you so much. It feels so good to hear you say that. And I want you to know that I get this job kind of changes the balance in our relationship, and I'm trying to be sensitive to that.",
        "Leonard: What?",
        "Penny: Well, I just think that maybe you're a little hung up on the money because I'm less reliant on you now, and that's a little scary.",
        "Leonard: Hmm. Maybe. Or maybe I tried to do something nice and maybe you had a problem with it because of your control issues.",
        "Penny: Control issues?",
        "Leonard: Maybe.",
        "Penny: Or, maybe now that I'm no longer an out-of-work actress who can't pay for her own dinner, that makes you a little insecure.",
        "Leonard: Well, I can't believe you'd say that. You know how insecure I am about my insecurities.",
        "Penny: You know what? I'm sorry. It's stupid to fight over money.",
        "Leonard: Yeah, I'm sorry, too. We're about to share the rest of our lives together. It's our money, who cares who has it?",

        "Raj: Did you get in?",
        "Amy: No. They forgot I was there. But it really opened up my pores.",
        "Sheldon: Well, according to my research, the steam tunnels below this access point should be the closest analog to the mines.",
        "Raj: This is gonna be so much more accurate than the steam room at the gym.",
        "Sheldon: Plus, there's almost no chance we'll see any of our coworkers half naked.",
        "Raj: Or totally naked. I love Howard, but the dude needs a little shame.",
        "Sheldon: All right, Amy, this walkie-talkie is yours. If we run into any problems, I'll contact you. And if anything bad happens, what's the rule?",

        "Raj: We're going to be fine.",
        "Amy: Sheldon, I'm really impressed you're willing to try this.",
        "Sheldon: Well, admittedly, this brushes up against my well-known aversions to heat, small places, going below floor-level, dampness, hatches, ladders, darkness, echoes, and eliminating in Home Depot buckets. That last one is quite new, but I have a feeling that's gonna rocket to the top of the list.",
        "Raj: I'm sweating already.",
        "Sheldon: Yeah, as the person beneath you, allow me to say, I know.",
        "Raj: How hot is it?",
        "Sheldon: Uh, let's see. 704? No, wait, it's on clock. Uh, the real answer isn't much better. 102 degrees.",
        "Raj: Well, that's what we wanted. This is as hot as the mines will be.",

        "Bernadette: I told you they weren't gonna ask us to swing with them.",
        "Howard: I didn't think they were going to. I just wanted to have a way to say no without hurting Leonard's feelings.",
        "Leonard: Well, nailed it.",
        "Howard: So what did you want to know?",
        "Penny: Well, do you guys ever fight over money?",

        "Howard: You didn't have to say so much more.",
        "Bernadette: Well, I didn't have to, but for the sake of accuracy I felt that I should.",

        "Howard: For your information, I just bought the last one I needed on eBay.",
