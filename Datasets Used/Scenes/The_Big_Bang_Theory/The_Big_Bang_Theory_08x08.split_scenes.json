    "Recap": [
        "After finding Penny's old prom dress the girls decide to have a new prom on the roof. Sheldon is worried about the post-prom mating activities that he feels Amy will expect and has a panic attack after he sees how pretty Amy is. Amy reassures him he is under no pressure, but she does hope they will have intimacy one day. She also wants to tell Sheldon something, even if he can't say it back. Sheldon surprises her by saying he loves her. Amy is shocked, then starts having a panic attack of her own. Howard is not happy since he figures Stuart will bring his mother. Stuart embarrasses him by bringing Howard's second-cousin Jeanie, the girl Howard lost his virginity to. Howard attacks Stuart in the limo for having relationships with his family members. A jealous call from Debbie causes Stuart to abandon Jeanie at the prom. Emily reveals she loves the darker versions of fairy tales, disturbing Bernadette. Leonard and Penny dance together romantically though no music is playing. They admit that they probably wouldn't have approached each other to dance if they had met at their proms, but are happy together now."

        "Howard: Oh, yeah, she loves that place. Every time they flip a shrimp in the air, she practically leaps out of her seat to catch it. That's why I don't take her to SeaWorld.",
        "Leonard: I know you-you don't want to hear it, but she was there with Stuart.",
        "Howard: That's fine. I don't care.",
        "Raj: It doesn't bug you when they go out on dates?",
        "Howard: They're not dating. They're just two friends who went out to dinner.",
        "Raj: And then went back to the home they share where they probably fell asleep in the matching pajamas she got them because they both just love penguins.",
        "Howard: Hey, lots of people wear matching pajamas who aren't dating.",
        "Raj: Like who?",

        "Howard: How is this helpful?",
        "Sheldon: All the non-human apes are classified as great apes except one. That means taxonomists created the entire category of lesser ape just to single out the poor gibbon as the weird kid on the playground. Now there's a hairy little fellow with a genuine beef.",
        "Leonard: But the gibbon doesn't know what it's categorized as. It doesn't even know it's called a gibbon.",
        "Sheldon: True. Sorry, kid, you've got it worse than a gibbon.",

        "Penny: Ah, You guys are the best.",
        "Amy: What's with the clothes?",

        "Amy: Easy.",

        "Bernadette: How was your prom? Did you go?",
        "Amy: No, but I was on clean-up crew.",
        "Penny: Aw, that's sad.",
        "Amy: No, it was okay. The DJ let me dance one slow song with my mop before he shut down. Whenever I see a bucket of dirty water, I still hear Lady in Red.",
        "Bernadette: My prom was pretty terrible, too. I was so excited about my date, but it turned out he only asked me 'cause he liked my friend. He spent the whole night talking about her.",
        "Amy: Okay, we get it, you had a friend and a date. Stop bragging.",
        "Penny: Doesn't matter. Prom is silly anyways.",
        "Bernadette: Easy for you to say; you probably went with the captain of the football team.",
        "Penny: No. I just made out with him a little while his date was puking.",
        "Amy: My date would've had to clean that up.",
        "Bernadette: Ooh, I have an idea. Maybe we can have, like, a prom do-over.",
        "Amy: Oh, that would be so much fun. We could decorate the roof and make the guys wear tuxedos.",
        "Bernadette: Ooh, and get our hair done, and slow-dance.",
        "Penny: Okay, guys, trust me, as someone who's been to, like, seven proms, it is never as good as you want it to be.",
        "Amy: You went to seven proms?",
        "Penny: Yeah, let's see. Uh, four Under the Seas, two Enchanted Evenings, and one Night to Remember that I cannot remember for the life of me.",

But then I saw Never Been Kissed, and I'm back on the prom bandwagon. This prom thing's been a real roller coaster.",
        "Howard: Bernie's really excited. I could tell because her voice got so high, the beagle next door started howling.",
        "Raj: Did you go to your prom?",
        "Sheldon: No. I had a date with a proper education. Instead of a tuxedo, I dressed myself in good habits. Instead of spiked punch, I enjoyed the intoxicating flavour of knowledge. Instead of dancing in a gym, I shook my bootyto the seductive rhythms...",

        "Sheldon: Next time I might be in a rush, it's good to have a few in the bank.",
        "Penny: Okay, what's up?",
        "Sheldon: I'd like to discuss this party that Amy and Bernadette are throwing. Since you and I are both reluctant to go, I think I've come up with a perfect way for us to enjoy it.",
        "Penny: Great, how?",
        "Sheldon: We pretend we're aliens. I'm not the best at reading facial cues, but I'm gonna say that you love it and want to hear more. Now, in the beloved novel Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, an alien named Ford Prefect pretended to be human in order to blend in so that he could write an entry about Earth for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which is a travel book within the actual book, which is also called The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.",
        "Penny: Okay, just one question. What?",
        "Sheldon: My point is, pretending to be an alien is a valuable coping mechanism I've used many times. I did it the first time I went to see you in a play. You had no idea Commander Umfrumf of Ceti Alpha Three was in the audience. Oh, don't worry, he gave you seven thumbs up.",
        "Penny: Here's a question, as an alien pretending to be human, are you planning to engage in any post-prom mating rituals with Amy?",
        "Sheldon: There are post-prom mating rituals?",
        "Penny: Not always. Unless your date drives a van with an air mattress, then always.",
        "Sheldon: Well, if it's part of the prom experience, then I'm open to it.",
        "Penny: You're kidding.",
        "Sheldon: I may be an alien, but I have urges. If Amy wants to copulate by firing her eggs into space, well, then, I will happily catch them with the reproductive sac on my upper flermin. I'm not the best at reading facial cues, but I can see that you're a little turned on.",

        "Sheldon: His name is Alfred, and, yes, he does.",
        "Leonard: There, perfect.",
        "Sheldon: What, are you sure? It's my first prom, I want to do it correctly.",
        "Leonard: I thought you were gonna pretend to be an alien.",
        "Sheldon: I was, but Penny didn't want to. You didn't want to. Bernadette, Amy, Koothrappali and Wolowitz didn't want to. And even I knew it was weird to hire somebody.",
        "Leonard: Was that a flask?",
        "Sheldon: Yes. I've decided to embrace all of the traditions associated with prom, including spiking the punch.",
        "Leonard: You're gonna put alcohol in the punch?",
        "Sheldon: Oh, no, this is pomegranate juice. It's all the fun of high school high jinks with the cell-protecting zip of antioxidants.",
        "Leonard: If you had ripped jeans and a leather jacket, you'd be like the toughest kid on the Disney Channel. So, anything else planned for tonight?",
        "Sheldon: Oh, everything. Getting our picture taken, slow-dancing, being elected prom king. Pointing out that kings aren't elected. It's gonna be off the hook.",
        "Leonard: And while you're at it, I know that at this age your hormones are raging, but just because all your friends are having s*x doesn't mean you have to.",
        "Sheldon: Why would you say that?",
        "Leonard: You know, 'cause, 'cause a lot of people lose their virginity on prom night.",
        "Sheldon: Penny implied the same thing. Is this true?",

        "Amy: What's that?",
        "Leonard: Oh, it's a scaly genital organ that grows between his shoulder blades. Try not to touch it when you're dancing.",
        "Sheldon: Excuse me.",
        "Amy: Where are you going?",
        "Sheldon: I can't do this. And for your information, Leonard, the upper flermin doesn't grow between my shoulder blades, it grows out of the belly button on my neck.",
