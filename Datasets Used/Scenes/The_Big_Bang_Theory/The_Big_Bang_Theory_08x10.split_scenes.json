    "Episode Title": "The Champagne Reflection",
    "Recap": [
        "Leonard, Raj and Howard clean out deceased Professor Roger Abbot's office and find champagne to be opened after his first great scientific discovery. Abbot's coworker Professor Sharpe reveals that a journal full of numbers is just Abbot's food calorie diary: he believed he could live forever by controlling his calorie intake. The men realize not every scientist can make great discoveries, and resolve to drink the champagne in Roger's honor if one of them ever discovers something. Sheldon prepares his final episode of \"Fun with Flags\" and reviews highlights of the series including Amy as a kangaroo, Sheldon dressed as Betsy Ross, and playing \"Fwag, Not a Fwag\" with Barry Kripke. Sheldon's final guest is LeVar Burton. The first viewer to comment on the episode posts that he will miss the series, leading Sheldon to plan its revival and uncork Roger's champagne in front of Leonard. Penny and Bernadette attend a banquet for their pharmaceutical company. After Penny makes Bernadette realize she has been verbally bullying others, she apologizes to their boss Dan, who is afraid of her, and starts crying on hearing how she has offended her coworkers. Dan feels bad and resumes fulfilling Bernadette's wishes."
