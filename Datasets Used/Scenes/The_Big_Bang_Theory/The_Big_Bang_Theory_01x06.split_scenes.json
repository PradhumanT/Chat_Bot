    "Recap": [
        "Penny invites the guys to her Halloween party. They at first decline as they do not dance, but accept when costumes are mentioned. At the party they have problems socializing: Sheldon is unable to explain his Doppler effect costume since none of Penny's friends are physicists or smart enough to understand it; Raj (dressed as Thor) cannot speak to women; Howard as Robin Hood is mistaken for Peter Pan; and Leonard (dressed as Frodo Baggins from The Lord of the Rings) is insecure. Penny's ex-boyfriend Kurt (underdressed as a very tall, muscular caveman) later shows up and aggressively confronts Leonard, causing him (and later Penny) to leave. Penny goes to check on Leonard and apologizes for Kurt's behavior. She is very upset, but Leonard tells her she is perfect, and they kiss, though Penny confesses she is drunk. They kiss again, in sight of Kurt, Leonard saying \"That's how we roll at the Shire!\" before locking his apartment door in panic. Meanwhile, Howard cannot find Raj, who is at home sleeping with a girl who finds him to be a \"very good listener\"."

        "Scene: Lobby of the apartment building, Howard, Raj, Sheldon and Leonard enter in combat gear, covered in blue paint.",
        "Raj: Okay, if no-one else will say it, I will. We really suck at paintball.",
        "Howard: That was absolutely humiliating.",
        "Leonard: Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.",
        "Howard: Yes, but you don't have to lose to Kyle Bernstein's Bar-Mitzvah party.",
        "Leonard: I think we have to acknowledge, those were some fairly savage pre-adolescent Jews.",
        "Sheldon: You know, we were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command.",
        "Leonard: Sheldon, let it go.",
        "Sheldon: No, I want to talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the back.",
        "Howard: I shot you for good reason, you were leading us into disaster.",
        "Sheldon: I was giving clear, concise orders.",
        "Leonard: You hid behind a tree yelling \"get the kid in the yarmulkah, get the kid in the yarmulkah.\"",
        "Penny (arriving): Oh, hey guys.",
        "Leonard: Hello Penny.",
        "Howard: Morning ma'am.",
        "Penny: So, how was paintball, did you have fun?",
        "Sheldon: Sure, if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun. (To Howard) You clear space on your calendar, there will be an enquiry.",
        "Penny: Okay, um, oh hey, I'm having a party on Saturday so if you guys are around you should come by.",
        "Leonard: A party?",
        "Penny: Yeah.",
        "Howard: A boy-girl party?",
        "Penny: Well, there will be boys, and there will be girls, and it is a party. So, it'll just be a bunch of my friends, we'll have some beer, do a little dancing...",
        "Sheldon: Dancing?",
        "Leonard: Yeah, I don't know, Penny...",
        "Sheldon: The thing is, we're not....",
        "Leonard: We're really more....",
        "Sheldon: No.",
        "Leonard: But thanks, thanks for thinking of us.",
        "Penny: Are you sure? Come on, it's Halloween.",
        "Sheldon: A Halloween party?",
        "Howard: As in, costumes?",
        "Penny: Well, yeah.",
        "Leonard: Is there a theme?",
        "Penny: Um, yeah, Halloween.",
        "Sheldon: Yes, but are the costumes random, or genre specific?",
        "Penny: As usual, I'm not following.",
        "Leonard: He's asking if we can come as anyone from science-fiction, fantasy...",
        "Penny: Sure.",
        "Sheldon: What about comic-books?",
        "Penny: Fine.",
        "Sheldon: Anime?",
        "Penny: Of course.",
        "Sheldon: TV , film, D&D, Manga, Greek Gods, Roman Gods, Norse Gods...",
        "Penny: Anything you want, okay? Any costume you want. Bye.",
        "Howard: Gentlemen, to the sewing machines. Credits Sequence",
        "Scene: The apartment living room. There is a knock on the door.",
        "Leonard (off): I'll get it. (He enters, wearing a Flash costume. Opens door.) Howard (Entering at speed, also wearing a Flash costume): Bjow (They stare at each other in shock.)",
        "Leonard: Oh, no.",
        "Sheldon: Oh no! (He is also wearing a Flash costume.)",
        "Raj: Make way for the fastest man alive. (Enters, also in a Flash costume.) Oh no!",
        "Sheldon: See, this is why I wanted to have a costume meeting.",
        "Leonard: We all have other costumes, we can change.",
        "Raj: Or, we could walk right behind each other all night and look like one person going really fast.",
        "Howard: No, no, no, it's a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo.",
        "Leonard: Okay, how about this, nobody gets to be The Flash, we all change, agreed?",
        "All: Agreed.",
        "Leonard: I call Frodo!",
        "All: Damn!",
        "Scene: The same, later. Leonard is dressed as Frodo. Howard appears to be Peter Pan. There is a knock on the door.",
        "Raj (Entering dressed as Thor): Hey. Sorry I'm late, but my hammer got stuck in the door on the bus.",
        "Leonard: You went with Thor?",
        "Raj: What? Just because I'm Indian I can't be a Norse God? No, no, no, Raj has to be an Indian God. That's racism. I mean, look at Wolowitz, he's not English, but he's dressed like Peter Pan. Sheldon(entering in a body suit featuring black and white vertical lines) is neither sound nor light, but he's obviously the Doppler Effect.",
        "Howard: I'm not Peter Pan, I'm Robin Hood.",
        "Raj: Really, because I saw Peter Pan, and you're dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby. She was a little bigger than you, but it's basically the same look, man.",
        "Leonard: Hey, Sheldon, there's something I want to talk to you about before we go to the party.",
        "Sheldon: I don't care if anybody gets it, I'm going as the Doppler Effect.",
        "Leonard: No, it's not...",
        "Sheldon: If I have to, I can demonstrate. Neeeeoooowwwww!",
        "Leonard: Terrific. Um, this party is my first chance for Penny to see me in the context of her social group, and I need you not to embarrass me tonight.",
        "Sheldon: Well, what exactly do you mean by embarrass you?",
        "Leonard: For example, tonight no-one needs to know that my middle name is Leakey.",
        "Sheldon: Well, there's nothing embarrassing about that, your father worked with Lewis Leakey, a great anthropologist. It had nothing to do with your bed-wetting.",
        "Leonard: All I'm saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for Penny to see me as a member of her peer group. A potential close friend and... perhaps more. I don't want to look like a dork.",
        "Scene: The hallway. Howard knocks on Penny's door with his bow.",
        "Howard: Just a heads up fellas, if anyone gets lucky I've got a dozen condoms in my quiver. Penny (opening door, not in costume): Oh, hey guys.",
        "Leonard: Hey, sorry we're late.",
        "Penny: Late? It's 7:05.",
        "Sheldon: And you said the party starts at seven.",
        "Penny: Well, yeah, when you start a party at seven, no-one shows up at, you know, seven.",
        "Sheldon: It's 7:05.",
        "Penny: Yes. Yes it is. Okay, well, um, come on in.",
        "Howard: What, are all the girls in the bathroom?",
        "Penny: Probably, but in their own homes.",
        "Sheldon: So what time does the costume parade start?",
        "Penny: The parade?",
        "Sheldon: Yeah, so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume, you know, most frightening, most authentic, most accurate visual representation of a scientific principle.",
        "Penny: Oh, Sheldon, I'm sorry but there aren't going to be any parades or judges or prizes.",
        "Sheldon: This party is just going to suck.",
        "Penny: No, come on, it's going to be fun, and you all look great, I mean, look at you, Thor, and, oh, Peter Pan, that's so cute.",
        "Leonard: Actually, Penny, he's Rob...",
        "Howard: I'm Peter Pan! And I've got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it.",
        "Penny: No you don't. Oh, hey, what's Sheldon supposed to be.",
        "Leonard: Oh, he's the Doppler Effect.",
        "Sheldon: Yes. It's the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer.",
        "Penny: Oh, sure, I see it now, the Doppler Effect. Alright, I've got to shower, you guys um, make yourselves comfortable.",
        "Leonard: Okay.",
        "Sheldon: See, people get it. Time shift, the party is in full swing, the four guys are sitting together around the coffee table.",
        "Raj: Mmmm, by Odin's beard, this is good Chex Mix.",
        "Howard: No thanks, peanuts, I can't afford to swell up in these tights.",
        "Sheldon: I'm confused. If there's no costume parade, what are we doing here?",
        "Leonard: We're socialising. Meeting new people.",
        "Sheldon: Telepathically? Penny (crossing the room in a cat costume, speaking to someone off-screen): Oh hey, when did you get here, Hi!",
        "Raj: Penny is wearing the worst Catwoman costume I have ever seen, and that includes Halle Berry's.",
        "Leonard: She's not Catwoman, she's just a generic cat.",
        "Sheldon: And that's the kind of sloppy costuming which results from a lack of rules and competition.",
        "Howard: Hey guys, check out the sexy nurse. I believe it's time for me to turn my head and cough.",
        "Raj: What is your move?",
        "Howard: I'm going to use the mirror technique. She brushes her hair back, I brush my hair back, she shrugs, I shrug, subconsciously she's thinking we're in sync, we belong together.",
        "Leonard: Where do you get this stuff?",
        "Howard: You know, psychology journals, internet research, and there's this great show on VH1 about how to pick up girls.",
        "Raj: Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such difficulty speaking to women. Or around women. Or at times, even effeminate men.",
        "Howard: If that's a working stethoscope, maybe you'd like to hear my heart skip a beat.",
        "Nurse Costume Girl: No thanks.",
        "Howard: No, seriously, you can, I have transient idiopathic arrhythmia.",
        "Leonard: I want to get to know Penny's friends, I just, I don't know how to talk to these people.",
        "Sheldon: Well, I actually might be able to help.",
        "Leonard: How so?",
        "Sheldon: Like Jane Goodall observing the apes, I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured, but patterns emerge, they have their own language if you will.",
        "Leonard: Go on.",
        "Sheldon: Well, it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting \"How wasted am I?\" which is met with an approving chorus of \"Dude.\"",
        "Leonard: Then what happens?",
        "Sheldon: That's as far as I've gotten.",
        "Leonard: This is ridiculous, I'm jumping in.",
        "Sheldon: Good luck.",
        "Leonard: No, you're coming with me.",
        "Sheldon: Oh, I hardly think so.",
        "Leonard: Come on.",
        "Sheldon: Aren't you afraid I'll embarrass you?",
        "Leonard: Yes. But I need a wing-man.",
        "Sheldon: Alright, but if we're going to use flight metaphors I'm much more suited to being the guy from the FAA, analysing wreckage.",
        "Girl in Hippie Costume: Oh, Hi!",
        "Leonard: Hi.",
        "Sheldon: Hello.",
        "Girl: So, what are you supposed to be?",
        "Sheldon: Me? I'll give you a hint. Neeeeooooowwwww!",
        "Girl: Uh, a choo-choo train?",
        "Sheldon: Close! Neeeeeoooooowwwww!",
        "Girl: A brain damaged choo-choo train? Girl in Butterfly Costume (dropping onto sofa next to Raj): How wasted am I? (Raj shrugs.) Time shift. Sheldon and Leonard are now talking to a girl in a princess costume.",
        "Sheldon: Neeeeeooooowwwwww!",
        "Girl: I still don't get it.",
        "Sheldon: I'm the Doppler Effect.",
        "Girl: Okay, if that is some sort of learning disability, I think it's very insensitive.",
        "Leonard: Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?",
        "Sheldon: Well, why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves.",
        "Leonard: Because I'm Frodo.",
        "Sheldon: Yes, well, I'm the Doppler Effect.",
        "Leonard: Oh no.",
        "Sheldon: What?",
        "Leonard: That's Penny's ex-boyfriend.",
        "Sheldon: What do you suppose he's doing here? Besides disrupting the local gravity field.",
        "Leonard: If he were any bigger, he'd have moons orbiting him.",
        "Sheldon: Oh, snap. So I guess we'll be leaving now.",
        "Leonard: Why should we leave? For all we know, he crashed the party and Penny doesn't even want him here. (Penny and Kurt hug).",
        "Sheldon: You have a back-up hypothesis.",
        "Leonard: Maybe they just want to be friends.",
        "Sheldon: Or maybe she wants to be friends, and he wants something more.",
        "Leonard: Then he and I are on equal ground.",
        "Sheldon: Yes, but you're much closer to it than he is.",
        "Leonard: Look, if this was 15,000 years ago, by virtue of his size and strength, Kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners.",
        "Sheldon: And male partners. Animal partners. Large primordial eggplants, pretty much whatever tickled his fancy.",
        "Leonard: Yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift, in the information age, Sheldon, you and I are the alpha males. We shouldn't have to back down.",
        "Sheldon: True. Why don't you text him that and see if he backs down?",
        "Leonard: No. I'm going to assert my dominance face to face.",
        "Sheldon: Face to face? Are you going to wait for him to sit down, or are you going to stand on a coffee table?",
        "Leonard: Hello Penny. Hello Kurt.",
        "Penny: Oh, hey guys. You having a good time?",
        "Sheldon: Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing indictment of the American education system.",
        "Kurt: What, you're a zebra, right?",
        "Sheldon: Yet another child left behind.",
        "Kurt: And what are you supposed to be, an Elf?",
        "Leonard: No, I'm a Hobbit.",
        "Kurt: What's the difference?",
        "Leonard: Uh, a Hobbit is a mortal Halfling inhabitant of Middle Earth, whereas an Elf is an immortal tall warrior.",
        "Kurt: So why the hell would you want to be a Hobbit?",
        "Sheldon: Because he is neither tall nor immortal, and none of us could be The Flash.",
        "Kurt: Well, whatever, why don't you go hop off on a quest, I'm talking to Penny here.",
        "Leonard: I think we're all talking to Penny here.",
        "Sheldon: I'm not. No offence.",
        "Kurt: Okay, maybe you didn't hear me, go away.",
        "Penny: Alright Kurt, be nice.",
        "Kurt: Aw, I am being nice. Right little buddy.",
        "Penny: Kurt!",
        "Leonard: Okay, I understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me. I mean, you can't compete with me on an intellectual level and so you're driven to animalistic puffery.",
        "Kurt: Are you calling me a puffy animal?",
        "Penny: Of course not, no, he's not, you're not, right Leonard?",
        "Leonard: No, I said animalistic. Of course we're all animals, but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree.",
        "Sheldon: If he understands that, you're in trouble.",
        "Kurt: So what, I'm unevolved?",
        "Sheldon: You're in trouble.",
        "Kurt: You know, you use a lot of big words for such a little dwarf.",
        "Penny: Okay, Kurt, please.",
        "Leonard: No, Penny, it's okay, I can handle this. I'm not a dwarf, I'm a Hobbit. A Hobbit. Are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion from short-term to long-term memory?",
        "Kurt: Okay, now you're starting to make me mad.",
        "Leonard: A homo-habilus discovering his opposable thumbs says what?",
        "Kurt: What?",
        "Leonard: I think I've made my point.",
        "Kurt: Yeah, how about I make a point out of your pointy little head.",
        "Sheldon: Let me remind you, while my moral support is absolute, in a physical confrontation I will be less than useless.",
        "Leonard: There's not going to be a confrontation, in fact I doubt if he can even spell confrontation. Kurt (physically lifting Leonard from the ground): C - O - N... frontation!",
        "Penny: Kurt, put him down this instant.",
        "Kurt: He started it.",
        "Penny: I don't care, I'm finishing it, put him down.",
        "Kurt: Fine. You're one lucky little leprechaun.",
        "Sheldon: He's a Hobbit! I've got your back.",
        "Penny: Leonard, are you okay.",
        "Leonard: Yeah, no, I'm fine. It's good, it's a good party, thanks for having us, it's just getting a little late so....",
        "Penny: Oh, okay, alright, well thank you for coming.",
        "Sheldon: Happy Halloween. (They leave) If it's any consolation, I thought that homo-habilus line really put him in his place.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Scene: The living room. Sheldon brings Leonard a cup of tea.",
        "Leonard: What's that?",
        "Sheldon: Tea. When people are upset the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages. There there. You want to talk about it?",
        "Leonard: No.",
        "Sheldon: Good. There there was really all I had.",
        "Leonard: Good night Sheldon.",
        "Sheldon: Good night Leonard. Penny (knocking on door and entering): Hey Leonard.",
        "Leonard: Hi Penny.",
        "Penny: Hey, I just wanted to make sure you're okay.",
        "Leonard: I'm fine.",
        "Penny: I'm so sorry about what happened.",
        "Leonard: It's not your fault.",
        "Penny: Yes it is. That's why I broke up with him, he always does stuff like that.",
        "Leonard: So why was he at your party?",
        "Penny: Well, I ran into him last week and, he was... just, all apologetic, about how he's changed, he was just going on and on and I believed him, and I'm an idiot because I always believe guys like that and... I can't go back to my party because he's there, and I know you don't want to hear this and I'm upset and I'm really drunk and I just want to... (bursts into tears and rests head on Leonard's shoulder.)",
        "Leonard: There there.",
        "Penny: God, what is wrong with me.",
        "Leonard: Nothing, you're perfect.",
        "Penny: Gah, I'm not perfect.",
        "Leonard: Yes you are.",
        "Penny: You really think so, don't you? (She kisses hm.)",
        "Leonard: Penny?",
        "Penny: Yeah.",
        "Leonard: How much have you had to drink tonight?",
        "Penny: Just.... a lot.",
        "Leonard: Are you sure that your being drunk, and your being angry with Kurt doesn't have something to do with what's going on here?",
        "Penny: It might. Boy, you're really smart.",
        "Leonard: Yeah, I'm a frickin' genius.",
        "Penny: Leonard, you are so great. Why can't all guys be like you?",
        "Leonard: Because if all guys were like me, the human race couldn't survive.",
        "Penny: I should probably go.",
        "Leonard: Probably.",
        "Penny (in doorway): Thank you. (She kisses him again. Kurt is watching.)",
        "Leonard: That's right, you saw what you saw. That's how we roll in The Shire. (Closes door quickly, locks and chains it.)",
        "Scene: The apartment, there is a knock on the door.",
        "Sheldon: Coming. (Opens door to Howard.)",
        "Howard: Hey, have you seen Koothrapali?",
        "Sheldon: He's not here. Maybe the Avenger summoned him.",
        "Howard: He's not the Marvel comic story, he's the original Norse God.",
        "Sheldon: Thank you for the clarification.",
        "Howard: I'm supposed to give him a ride home.",
        "Sheldon: Well I'm sure he'll be fine. He has his hammer.",
        "Scene: A random bedroom. Butterfly costume girl is climbing off of Raj.",
        "Butterfly Girl: Wow, I have to say, you are an amazing man. You're gentle and passionate, and my God, you are such a good listener!",
        "(Raj puts hands behind head with a smug expression on his face.)"
