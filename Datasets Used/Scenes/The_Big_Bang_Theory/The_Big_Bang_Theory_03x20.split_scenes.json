        "Scene: The lobby.",
        "Penny: Oh, damn, they cancelled my Visa. Oh, yay, a new MasterCard!",
        "Sheldon: Uh-oh.",
        "Penny: What?",
        "Sheldon: I was going to get my mail.",
        "Penny: Okay. Are, are you hoping to get it telepathically?",
        "Sheldon: I think you mean telekinetically. And no, I just wasn't sure of the proper protocol now that you and Leonard are no longer having coitus.",
        "Penny: God, can we please just say no longer seeing each other?",
        "Sheldon: Well, we could if it were true. But as you live in the same building, you see each other all the time. The variable which has changed is the coitus.",
        "Penny: Okay, here's the protocol, you and I are still friends, and you stop saying coitus.",
        "Sheldon: Good, good. I'm glad we're still friends.",
        "Penny: Really?",
        "Sheldon: Oh, yes. It was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life. I'd hate for that effort to have been in vain.",
        "Penny: Right.",
        "Sheldon: Just to be clear do I have to stop saying coitus with everyone or just you?",
        "Penny: Everyone.",
        "Sheldon: Harsh terms. But all right, I'll just substitute intercourse.",
        "Penny: Great.",
        "Sheldon: Or fornication. Yeah. But that has judgmental overtones, so I'll hold that in reserve.",
        "Penny: So, how you been?",
        "Sheldon: Well, my existence is a continuum, so I've been what I am at each point in the implied time period.",
        "Penny: You're just coitusing with me, aren't you?",
        "Sheldon: Bazinga.",
        "Penny: Mmm. How's Leonard doing?",
        "Sheldon: He seems all right. Although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on. Oh, but now that I think of it, he asked me not to tell you that.",
        "Penny: I'll pretend I didn't hear it.",
        "Sheldon: I'd rather you pretend I didn't say it. I see you bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce.",
        "Penny: Yep.",
        "Sheldon: That's the sauce my mother uses. She likes cooking Italian because according to her, that's what the Romans made Jesus eat.",
        "Penny: Interesting. I'll have to have you over for spaghetti some night.",
        "Sheldon: I'm hungry now.",
        "Penny: Oh. Um, okay. Why don't you give me an hour and come over?",
        "Sheldon: Will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce?",
        "Penny: I don't have hot dogs.",
        "Sheldon: Oh, it's all right, I do. Oh! You're in for what my mother calls a real Eye-talian treat. (Enters apartment).",
        "Leonard: Hey, where you been?",
        "Sheldon: I was talking with Penny.",
        "Howard: What's wrong with you? You can't hang out with your roommate's ex. That's totally uncool.",
        "Leonard: No, no, it's fine. I don't care. I'm over it.",
        "Raj: Yeah, he's over it, that's why he's been whining all day about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black.",
        "Sheldon: Is he making any progress? Because I'd like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil.",
        "Howard: So would Ben Affleck. The point is, in a situation like this you got to pick sides. You're either on Team Leonard or Team Penny.",
        "Sheldon: Which one picks last?",
        "Howard: What?",
        "Sheldon: Well, usually I'm on the team that picks last. Unless there's a kid in a wheelchair.",
        "Leonard: Sheldon, I got you your tangerine chicken. I hope you're hungry.",
        "Sheldon: Well, of course I'm hungry. And as I have no plans to eat with any other team, I will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto. Mm, mm, mm!",
        "Leonard: Okay.",
        "Sheldon: Just out of curiosity, do we still have hot dogs?",
        "Leonard: I don't know. Why?",
        "Sheldon: Just making dinner conversation. Go, Team Leonard! Credits sequence",
        "Scene: A few moments later.",
        "Howard: Oh, God, this is good.",
        "Raj: Let me ask you a question. Do you believe you're going to go to hell for eating sweet and sour pork?",
        "Howard: Jews don't have hell. We have acid reflux.",
        "Leonard: Do you want the last dumpling, Sheldon?",
        "Sheldon: Certainly. It's not like I have to moderate my food intake because I'm planning on eating again very shortly. Mm, mm, mm!",
        "Leonard: So, you guys want to do something tonight?",
        "Howard: Nah, I can't. I got to pick up my mom from her water aerobics class. 18 overweight women flapping their arm fat in a swimming pool. Looks like the manatee tank at Sea World.",
        "Leonard: What about you, Raj?",
        "Raj: Oh, there it is, now that you don't have a girlfriend, you want to hang out with me again.",
        "Leonard: I never stopped hanging out with you.",
        "Raj: Oh, please, we all know I'm the friend you call when you have no other options. If we were the Justice League, I'd be Aquaman.",
        "Howard: I wish you were Aquaman. Then I could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank.",
        "Sheldon: Excuse me, I'm thirsty, so I'm going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage.",
        "Leonard: You know what? I'll just spend the evening alone.",
        "Raj: What, suddenly I'm not good enough for you?",
        "Sheldon: Ah, I do so love beverages. Now I think I'll take my after-dinner walk.",
        "Leonard: Since when do you take after-dinner walks?",
        "Howard: Yeah, since when do you take walks?",
        "Sheldon: I read a study online that walking after a meal not only aids in digestion, but increases serotonin, and you know me, if there's one thing I like more than a refreshing beverage, it's serotonin. Bye-bye.",
        "Howard: Hold on. I'll walk down with you.",
        "Sheldon: Oh, that's not necessary. You can go first.",
        "Howard: Or we could go together.",
        "Sheldon: I can't think of a reason why not.",
        "Howard: Let's go.",
        "Sheldon: Hold on. Nope, no reason.",
        "Raj: I've missed you.",
        "Scene: The lobby.",
        "Sheldon: All right, say hello to your mother for me.",
        "Howard: Okay.",
        "Sheldon: What?",
        "Howard: You said you were going for a walk.",
        "Sheldon: I didn't say outside.",
        "Howard: So what, you're just gonna walk up and down the stairs?",
        "Sheldon: No, of course not. That would be odd and suspicious behavior.",
        "Woman's voice: Here Bubbles. Here boy.",
        "Howard: Which way are you going?",
        "Sheldon: Which way are you going?",
        "Howard: I parked my scooter down the block.",
        "Sheldon: I'm going the other way. Bye.",
        "Howard: Bye. Actually, I'm this way. Do I smell hot dogs?",
        "Sheldon: No. I mean, I have no idea what you smell.",
        "Howard: I definitely smell raw hot dog.",
        "Sheldon: Perhaps you're getting a brain tumour.",
        "Howard: All right, have a nice walk.",
        "Sheldon: I shall. Have a nice scoot.",
        "Howard: You might want to stand back. I'm sitting on top of 13 horses here.",
        "Sheldon: Oh. Hello, doggie. Nice doggie. I bet you think you smell hot dogs. Look, a cat!",
        "Scene: Penny's apartment.",
        "Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Long pause, knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Penny opens door. A dishevelled Sheldon is holding up one hot dog.) Here. I had to trade the others for my life.",
        "Scene: The apartment.",
        "Raj: Hey, Leonard?",
        "Leonard: Yeah?",
        "Raj: I haven't had s*x in a year.",
        "Leonard: Where you going with this, Raj?",
        "Raj: Don't flatter yourself, dude. I want to go out and meet a woman.",
        "Leonard: So, go.",
        "Raj: Well, I need a wingman. I don't want to come off like a lonely loser.",
        "Leonard: And you think my presence will help with that?",
        "Raj: Well, I do. Next to you, I'll look like a catch.",
        "Leonard: I'm not going out tonight, Raj.",
        "Raj: All right. Would you mind if I went to your room and downloaded some Asian pornography?",
        "Leonard: Very much.",
        "Raj: Doesn't have to be Asian.",
        "Leonard: Don't worry. You'll meet a girl someday.",
        "Raj: No, I won't.",
        "Leonard: Yes, you will, and she'll be beautiful, and kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman.",
        "Raj: You really think so?",
        "Leonard: I do, and you'll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart. And she'll take it and grind it into pathetic, little pieces.",
        "Raj: But we'll have s*x first, right?",
        "Scene: Penny's apartment.",
        "Sheldon: Mmm, mmm, mmm. That's Eye-talian.",
        "Penny: So, um, was Leonard okay with you coming over?",
        "Sheldon: Oh, yes. In fact, he said, I'm fine, I don't care. And he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal.",
        "Penny: Well, good.",
        "Sheldon: I'm also pleased to report that he's all cried out over you.",
        "Penny: He's been crying?",
        "Sheldon: Oh, I believe that was something else I wasn't supposed to mention.",
        "Penny: Oh, God, I feel terrible.",
        "Sheldon: Do you have a stomach ache, too?",
        "Penny: No. Why, do you?",
        "Sheldon: No.",
        "Penny: Why did you ask if I had one, too?",
        "Sheldon: Just making polite dinner conversation. Your turn.",
        "Penny: All right. So, what's new in your life?",
        "Sheldon: Well, my new shoes are not made for running.",
        "Penny: Have you been running?",
        "Sheldon: No. It's just a suspicion I have. Mmm, mmm, mmm.",
        "Penny: I'm so glad you like it.",
        "Sheldon: I do. Leonard never cooks for me.",
        "Penny: Well, maybe that's 'cause Leonard can't cook.",
        "Sheldon: You can't cook and you made me this.",
        "Penny: Whatever. Ooh, I'm gonna get the cheesecake out of the fridge.",
        "Sheldon: Oh, Lord, I'm in Jewish hell.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Scene: The apartment.",
        "Raj: Look at this. Do you think she's really doing that or is it PhotoShop?",
        "Leonard: I'm pretty sure Martha Stewart never got naked with a room full of big, fat Japanese guys.",
        "Raj: You don't know that. Prison changes people.",
        "Leonard: Hey, where you been?",
        "Sheldon: I told you, walking.",
        "Leonard: For an hour and a half?",
        "Sheldon: I got lost.",
        "Leonard: How could you get lost? Your phone has GPS.",
        "Sheldon: Satellites are down. Solar flares.",
        "Raj: There are no solar flares right now.",
        "Sheldon: Yes, there are.",
        "Raj: Dude, I'm an astrophysicist. If there were solar flares, I'd be all up in it.",
        "Sheldon: I'm sorry. I misspoke. What I meant to say was my battery died.",
        "Leonard: What the hell was that about?",
        "Raj: I don't know. Do you think this is really Hillary Clinton doing it with Oprah?",
        "Leonard: Oh, we really need to get you a girl.",
        "Scene: Leonard's bedroom. Leonard is asleep.",
        "Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (knock, knock, knock) Leonard.",
        "Leonard: Oh, just come in!",
        "Sheldon: Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.",
        "Leonard: What do you want, Sheldon?",
        "Sheldon: Maybe this isn't a good time.",
        "Leonard: Tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God I will kill you.",
        "Sheldon: Do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin this conversation? Sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me.",
        "Leonard: What do you want?",
        "Sheldon: You may want to sit down.",
        "Leonard: I'm in bed!",
        "Sheldon: Point taken. You may want to sit up.",
        "Leonard: Sheldon!",
        "Sheldon: I've been seeing Penny behind your back.",
        "Leonard: Okay, when you say seeing Penny, what exactly does that mean?",
        "Sheldon: We had dinner last night. She made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it. Well, little hot dog. I gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog. A real, big dog. A hell hound. Tangential to the primary story. How about I circle back to it?",
        "Leonard: Fine. Why did you have dinner with Penny?",
        "Sheldon: I told you, she made spaghetti with little hot dogs. I like spaghetti with little hot dogs.",
        "Leonard: Then why did you have Chinese food with us?",
        "Sheldon: I didn't want to upset you. Howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money.",
        "Leonard: Is it possible he said Bros before Hos?",
        "Sheldon: Yes, but I rephrased it to avoid offending the hos.",
        "Leonard: Sheldon, I don't care if you want to be friends with Penny.",
        "Sheldon: Oh. Well, so the emotional turmoil that's been keeping me from achieving REM sleep was entirely unjustified?",
        "Leonard: Yes.",
        "Sheldon: Well then as my meemaw would say, looks like we butchered a pig, but nobody wanted bacon.",
        "Leonard: I guess not.",
        "Sheldon: And now, as promised, the tangent. Sheldon and the Hell Hound, or How I Lost My Hot Dogs.",
        "Scene: The laundry room.",
        "Penny: Oh, um, I, I can come back.",
        "Leonard: D-don't be silly. We're neighbours, we're going to run into each other, may as well get used to it.",
        "Penny: Yeah, I guess you're right.",
        "Leonard: You used to it yet?",
        "Penny: Nope.",
        "Leonard: Me neither. Oh, Sheldon seemed think that I would be upset about you hanging out with him. But I just want you to know it's fine.",
        "Penny: Oh, oh, good, because, um, his mother called me.",
        "Leonard: His mother?",
        "Penny: Yeah, she wants me to take him shopping for sheets and towels.",
        "Leonard: I was going to do that.",
        "Penny: Oh, well, then you, you do it.",
        "Leonard: No, I don't want to do it. You can do it.",
        "Penny: Okay, you can take him for shoes.",
        "Leonard: I just took him for shoes.",
        "Penny: Well, all I know is he says they hurt his feet.",
        "Leonard: Fine. I'll take him for shoes next Saturday.",
        "Penny: Oh, no, no, no, a bunch of us from work are going to Disneyland next Saturday and Sheldon wants to come.",
        "Leonard: You're taking him to Disneyland?",
        "Penny: Well, he heard me making plans on the phone. Was I going to say no?",
        "Leonard: All right. But let me know if you're going to stuff him with junk food. I don't want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste.",
        "Penny: We're going to Disneyland. He's going to eat junk food.",
        "Leonard: All I'm saying is give me a heads-up.",
        "Penny: Okay, whatever.",
        "Leonard: And don't let him go on Space Mountain after he eats. He'll say he can handle it, but I promise you'll end up with churro puke on your shoes.",
        "Penny: All right, got it. Is there anything else?",
        "Leonard: Yeah, don't let Goofy near him. He'll have nightmares and I'll have to deal with it.",
        "Penny: What's the problem with Goofy?",
        "Leonard: Wish I knew. He's fine with Pluto.",
        "Scene: The apartment.",
        "Raj: Hey, do you think the elastic woman in The Incredibles needs to use birth control or can she just be a diaphragm?",
        "Howard: Well, that's it. We're officially out of things to talk about.",
        "Penny: We're home.",
        "Leonard: It's ten o'clock, where have you been?",
        "Sheldon: We stayed for the California Adventure water show. It was pure Disney magic.",
        "Leonard: I was going to see that with him.",
        "Penny: How was I supposed to know that?",
        "Sheldon: It's all right. I'll see it again with you.",
        "Leonard: And I have food here. You said you were going to call.",
        "Penny: I know, I know.",
        "Sheldon: I can still eat.",
        "Penny: No, you already threw up once. Go put on your PJs and brush your teeth.",
        "Sheldon: Okay, but just don't fight",
        "Leonard: We're not fighting.",
        "Penny: Just go.",
        "Leonard: Aren't you going to thank Penny for taking you to Disneyland?",
        "Sheldon: Thank you, Penny.",
        "Penny: You're welcome, sweetie.",
        "Leonard: Want a cup of coffee?",
        "Penny: Oh, um, I should probably get going.",
        "Leonard: Come on. It's just a cup of coffee.",
        "Penny: Yep, okay. Howard (to Raj, who has whispered to him): Oh, yeah, the whole thing seems a little twisted to me, too.",
        "Leonard: What am I smelling?",
        "Penny: Sheldon's churro on my shoes.",
        "Scene: Sheldon's bedroom.",
        "Penny: He's such an angel when he's asleep.",
        "Leonard: Yeah. Shame he has to wake up.",
        "Penny: I think we can do it.",
        "Leonard: Smother Sheldon in his sleep? Wouldn't that be wrong?",
        "Penny: No, be friends. You and me.",
        "Leonard: Oh. Sure. Absolutely.",
        "Penny: Good. I'm glad.",
        "Leonard: Here's an idea. I'm just throwing it out there, friends who have s*x.",
        "Penny: Good night, Leonard.",
        "Leonard: Kidding. Just a couple of friends goofin' around.",
        "Sheldon (in his sleep): No, Goofy, no."
