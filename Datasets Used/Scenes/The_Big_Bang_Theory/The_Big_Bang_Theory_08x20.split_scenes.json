        "Sheldon is depressed because he was left out of a group attending a symposium at the home of Richard Feynman. Wil Wheaton has Penny on his podcast to talk about the terrible movie they worked on together, \"Serial Ape-ist 2\". Kevin Smith calls to offer her an audition for Clerks III. Leonard, who is not thrilled with her risking her good pharmaceutical job, is stunned when he learns she makes twice the money than he does and is being more mature than him. Howard now owns his mother's house after his father Sam signed it away with no contact. While discussing future plans with Raj and Bernadette, Howard is shocked when he is visited by a half-brother, Josh."

        "Wil: Thanks a lot, caller. You know that the movie actually has a little bit of a cult following.",
        "Penny: Really?",
        "Wil: Yeah. I was at a science-fiction convention, and I saw a woman dressed as your half-ape character.",
        "Leonard: Oh, if she was with an Indian guy dressed like a banana, that was just my friends, Howard and Raj.",
        "Wil: All right, it's time for a very special guest caller, a friend of mine, who you probably know as the director of such movies as Clerks, or from podcasts and books where he often reminds you that he's the guy who directed Clerks. Hello, Kevin Smith.",
