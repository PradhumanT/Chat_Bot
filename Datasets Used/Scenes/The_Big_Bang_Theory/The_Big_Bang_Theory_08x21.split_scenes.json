    "Recap": [
        "Raj is working on a proposal for NASA to design a method of communicating with extraterrestrial intelligent beings. He asks the guys for advice and Sheldon and Howard try to take control, so Raj invites only Leonard to work with him. The two realize Sheldon and Howard's ideas were good and ask them to work with them after all. The guys talk about times where they have individually felt excluded from fun group activities while working together. Penny is unsure whether she should risk her new career for a chance at acting again and goes to Sheldon for advice. At first Sheldon will not tell her what to do because people think he is too controlling. Penny uses his love of trains in an analogy to get him to say she should go to the audition, but not decide on any major career change yet. An optimistic Penny goes to the audition only to be reminded of the petty environment around other actresses. Penny thanks Bernadette for getting her the good pharmaceutical job and takes her and Amy on a special dinner after Bernadette's prodding."

        "Howard: Yeah, absolutely. You need a device capable of delivering information across a wide range of perceptual modalities.",

        "Penny: No.",

        "Penny: Oh, I guess you're right. Maybe it is the person who asks.",

        "Penny: I'm sorry. What was I thinking?",
        "Sheldon: Uh, just out of curiosity, why didn't you ask Leonard for advice about this?",

        "Raj: Okay, so we know that previous attempts to send a message into space, like the Golden Record on Voyager, were heavily criticized.",
        "Leonard: Well, aliens could only play the Golden Record if they figured out how to build a record player.",
        "Raj: Eh. Although, to be fair, I watched E.T. build a telephone out of a Speak & Spell and an umbrella. Dude was like a little brown MacGyver.",
        "Leonard: That would be more helpful if E.T. were real.",
        "Raj: Well, my feelings were real when he was about to die.",

        "Raj: Okay, let's talk about something else.",
        "Leonard: All right, so it sounds like we need a way to communicate that's simple.",
        "Raj: And doesn't require outside machinery to be built to access it.",
        "Leonard: It's also a problem because we don't even know if the aliens who find this can see. I mean, they might communicate in a totally different way than us.",
        "Raj: Like when my dog is mad at me, she tells me by peeing in my slippers.",
        "Leonard: That's actually a valid example. Animals do deliver messages through scent.",
        "Raj: Bees talk to each other by dancing. Whales have their songs.",
        "Leonard: Yeah. Penny has about twenty different ways of rolling her eyes that each mean something different.",
        "Raj: Okay, so, what it sounds like is, what we want is a device that can deliver a message through not only sight, but other senses, as well.",
        "Leonard: The most basic sense that any space-faring civilization would have to possess is touch.",
        "Raj: Ooh. Ooh, ooh. We could make a video-playing device that simultaneously translates the information into a tactile medium.",
        "Leonard: All we have to do is rig up a 3-D communication system.",
