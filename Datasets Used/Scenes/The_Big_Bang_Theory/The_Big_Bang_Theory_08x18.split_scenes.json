    "Recap": [
        "Scientific American praises the paper Leonard and Sheldon wrote together, but omits Leonard's name. Sheldon fails to comfort Leonard over the omission, while Penny tries to cheer up Leonard by buying online for him. Meanwhile, Howard, Bernadette and Raj arrive at Howard's mother's home to remove some of her belongings, only to be told by Stuart the power is out. A distraught Howard realizes the last food his mother ever cooked will defrost in the freezer and be ruined. He decides to invite his friends over to eat it all, so it will be like his mother is feeding everybody one last time. At the dinner, Sheldon and Leonard argue about whether an idea's inspiration or execution is more important. Bernadette takes Sheldon and Leonard to another room and scolds them for their bickering and being insensitive to Howard whose mother recently passed away. Howard remarks that Bernadette's yelling sounds similar to his mother's, though the others claim to not hear it. Finally, everyone is over-stuffed from eating and lazing around the house. The group expresses mild excitement upon hearing that Physics Today has mentioned Leonard's name in connection with the paper, but are much more enthusiastic when Bernadette finds more Tums."

        "Sheldon: An article was just published in Scientific American about our theory.",

        "Sheldon: You know, you're right. Yeah. You know, it's like when Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created Spider-Man. Stan Lee may get all the credit, but Steve Ditko knows he was just as important. Even though Stan Lee gets to be in all the Marvel movies. And. and he's far richer. And he's a household name, you know?

        "Raj: Everything okay?",
        "Howard: No. All Ma's food is gonna be ruined.",
        "Bernadette: Well, why don't we take it home and put it in our freezer?",
        "Raj: You don't want to do that. Refreezing not only removes moisture, but it creates ice crystals in the fibres of the meat that can compromise its taste and texture. What? I saw a teachable moment. I dropped some culinary science.",
        "Bernadette: What should we do?",

        "Penny: Wait, who's Tor?",
        "Raj: You know, Tor, the God of \"Tunder\". As I was saying, is this a sign that our society is approaching gender equality?",

        "Amy: We won't know if there's equality until female Thor has a baby and the Avengers are cool with her pumping breast milk at work.",
        "Howard: I wonder if only a baby who is worthy can suckle at the bosom of Thor.",
        "Penny: Okay, new salon topic. Salons, dumb thing from a long time ago or interesting thing made dumb by talking about superheroes? Discuss.",
        "Sheldon: I don't believe it matters what the topic is. What's crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way. It's all about the execution.",
        "Leonard: Of course you'd focus on that rather than the inspiration. Uh, new salon topic. What's more important, an idea or its execution?",
        "Bernadette: Oh, that's fine.",
        "Sheldon: Yeah, good for you, Leonard. That's a lovely little notion. Kind of like, \"I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago.\" Yeah, now stand back while I invent the telephone. \"Hello? Oh, hold on.\" Leonard, it's your uncle. He says you just got burned.",
        "Amy: Sheldon.",
        "Penny: Guys.",
        "Leonard: No, it's okay. We're all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion. At least I am. Howard, what do you think?",
        "Howard: Well, I guess, as an engineer, I lean towards execution. I spend my days trying to take ideas and make them real.",
        "Sheldon: Well said, old chap. I thought eloquence had died, here it stands before us. Starting today, it'll go Gettysburg Address, \"I have a dream,\" and what he just said.",
        "Leonard: Oh, now he's a genius? All you ever do is make fun of him and engineering.",
        "Sheldon: Leonard, please. His mother just died.",
        "Leonard: You're being ridiculous.",
        "Sheldon: Yeah, so are you.",
        "Penny: Guys, if I wanted to hear people be bitchy, I'd go to my real salon.",
        "Sheldon: Leonard, lots of people could've had that idea, but very few people could've worked out the math the way I did.",
        "Leonard: Lots of people also didn't have that idea, like everyone in the entire world except for me.",
        "Sheldon: Oh, well, apparently Leonard thinks he's better than everyone in the whole world, including those fighting for our freedom. Yeah, well, I don't know about you, but I support our boys overseas.",
        "Amy: And girls.",
        "Sheldon: Hey, you already ruined Thor; give it a rest.",
        "Leonard: So I'm just supposed to be okay with you hogging all the credit?",
