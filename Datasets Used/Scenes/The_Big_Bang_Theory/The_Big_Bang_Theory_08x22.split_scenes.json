    "Recap": [
        "Leonard has been asked to give the graduation speech at his old high school in New Jersey and is excited to bring Penny with him; however their flight is cancelled due to bad weather. Penny arranges with the school to broadcast Leonard's speech over Skype and buys him a \"sexy graduate\" costume for a graduation cap and gown. Leonard's speech starts out boring so he changes it as he reflects on his own high school life. He explains to the smart and forgotten kids that after they graduate the world will find them far more interesting than the popular students. Raj has bought a quadcopter, but is unable to get it to work so he brings it to Howard and Sheldon to fix it. Raj's father is outraged at the cost of it so he cuts off Raj's allowance; however, Raj is able to leverage his parents' divorce as a way to get them both to separately send him more money. Howard tears the quadcopter apart, but is unable to get it to work. The guys begrudgingly call tech support like Bernadette suggested. While on the phone the quadcopter activates itself after receiving a random signal and flies wildly around the apartment terrorizing everyone."

Uh, you know, I, I wrote an entire speech to say how high school prepares you and what a wonderful place it is, but I hated it. Maybe high school's great if you look like this, but I didn't even feel like I existed at that school. And now that I think about it, I bet a lot of you feel the same way. So, for the remainder of my speech, this is for the invisible kids. Uh, maybe you never fit in. Or maybe you're the smallest kid in the school, or the heaviest or the weirdest. Maybe you're graduating and you still haven't had your first kiss. By the way, 19, and Geraldine Coco, wherever you are, thank you. Maybe you don't have any friends. And guess what? That's okay.
