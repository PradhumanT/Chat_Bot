    "Recap": [
        "While making out on the fifth anniversary of their first date, Sheldon offends Amy by debating whether he should watch The Flash instead of focusing on her as she wonders where they are going in their relationship. Sheldon doesn't understand why everyone thinks their relationship has moved too slowly, pointing out that Leonard and Penny have not discussed their wedding plans in months. Amy tells Sheldon she needs to take a break from the relationship to figure out what to do, leaving Sheldon unsure of what to do with the engagement ring he got her. After deflecting Sheldon's questions, Leonard and Penny decide to elope in Las Vegas. While driving there, Leonard admits he drunkenly kissed another woman two years ago while on the boat in the North Sea. Penny is upset but appears to forgive him as they weren't engaged then. Howard and Bernadette want Stuart to move out, but always find a reason not to bring it up. They finally get up the nerve to tell him, only to back off when they realize it is his birthday. Raj is spooked out by Emily's latest morbid idea: having sex in a graveyard. While having a picnic there, he says they are very different people and it appears he wants to break up, but when Emily confronts him he instead says he loves her."

        "Sheldon: I know. Do you think I should start watching The Flash TV show?",

        "Sheldon: Well, one of the things.",

        "Amy: What are you doing?",
        "Sheldon: You're right, you did kind of kill the mood.",
        "Amy: I didn't kill anything. You did, talking about your stupid TV show.",
        "Sheldon: Excuse me. Starting to watch a television show that might run for years isn't a decision to take lightly. I'm wrestling with a big commitment issue here.",
        "Amy: Really? That's the commitment issue you're wrestling with? Sheldon, do you understand the irony of your fixation on a man with super speed, while after five years all I can get out of you is a distracted make-out session on a couch?",
        "Sheldon: Irony's not really my strong suit. But I have been getting better with sarcasm, if you want to give that a try.",

        "Leonard: I'm gonna guess that your main concern is the time commitment of watching an entire season of a new show.",

        "Howard: Well, if it's her father's grave and they didn't get along, then you know she holds a grudge.",
        "Bernadette: The only issue is that everybody has their own thing, and as long as it's two consenting adults, I guess I don't see the harm in it.",
        "Raj: Well, what if it's one consenting adult and one adult who pretends to consent because he's afraid of being alone?",
