    "Recap": [
        "Sheldon and Leonard are getting an award for the paper they wrote together and both their mothers are in town for the ceremony. Both mothers focus on Sheldon, making Leonard jealous. He is also irritated when Sheldon claims Penny's engagement ring stone is really a recycled and recut drill bit diamond. Beverly wonders why Leonard and Penny haven't set a wedding date, while Mary is fine with them waiting. The mothers also get into an argument after Beverly describes Mary's religious beliefs as a superstition. Beverly later reflects with Sheldon that perhaps there are other ways than hers to raise children. The mothers make up and Beverly tries to show affection by hugging Leonard, though it is awkward for both of them. Meanwhile, Howard and Bernadette have moved into Mrs. Wolowitz's house with Stuart still living there as well. Bernadette is tired of the other two and Raj lazing around, so she makes them clean the kitchen. Raj points out to Howard that Bernadette acts like his mother. Howard tries to clean the kitchen like an adult but does a poor job. The three men continue cleaning while singing \"It's the Hard Knock Life\" from the musical Annie."

        "Mrs Cooper: I tried to read your paper, but it was very hard for me to understand.",
        "Sheldon: Oh, it's quite straightforward, actually. It describes a new model of the universe that conceptualizes it as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.",
        "Mrs Cooper: Interesting. You can believe that, but God filling an ark with animals two-by-two is nonsense.",

        "Leonard: What does that mean?",
        "Dr Hofstadter: You've been on and off with this woman for seven years and engaged for one year. One has to wonder if there's a problem. Are you having satisfactory intercourse?",
        "Leonard: Yes, Mother.",
        "Dr Hofstadter: Only satisfactory. I see.",
        "Leonard: I change my answer. It, it's amazing. It's hot. We can barely keep our hands off each other.",
        "Dr Hofstadter: Seems odd to try and impress your mother with your sexual prowess. But then, you always did have that unresolved Oedipal complex.",
        "Leonard: See, this right here, what you're doing, can you please not do that around Sheldon's mom?",
        "Dr Hofstadter: Why? Are you attracted to her, too?",
        "Leonard: Of course not. She's, she's just a very sweet and God-fearing lady, and you have to be respectful of her beliefs.",

        "Leonard: We just spent two hours in traffic. Did you think to mention to me that you liked our paper?",

        "Dr Hofstadter: Calm down, dear. Mary, I'm curious. When did you first realize that your son had such a remarkable mind?",
        "Sheldon: Ooh, good question. Everyone loves stories about Sheldon Cooper, boy genius.",
        "Mrs Cooper: Well, I would have to say when he was 13 and tried to build a nuclear reactor in the tool shed.",
        "Sheldon: Ooh, this is a good one.",
        "Mrs Cooper: Now, the first thing you have to know about Shelly is ever since he was a little boy, he was always concerned with the well-being of others. And he didn't think that it was fair for people to pay for electricity, so he was gonna power the entire town for free.",
        "Sheldon: (stammers) Tell her about the uranium. Tell her about the uranium.",
        "Mrs Cooper: Oh, well. Oh, this is adorable. When he arranged to get some yellowcake from Chad, I thought he was talking about Twinkies from one of his friends.",

        "Sheldon: Oh, no, not at all. No, we, uh, found a place online that, uh, repurposes diamond drill bits.",
        "Leonard: We did not. That's not true. Can I speak to you alone for a second?",
        "Sheldon: Oh, sure.",
        "Leonard: It came from Tiffany's.",
        "Sheldon: You mean the box, right?",
        "Leonard: Keep walking.",
        "Penny: Really doesn't matter to me how much he spent on the ring. I think.",
        "Sheldon: Did I misspeak about the ring?",
        "Leonard: Yes, and we'll get back to that. But, uh, even with your mother here, you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom. You're like one of those elephant seal pups that steals the milk from two mothers.",
        "Sheldon: Do you mean what marine biologists refer to as super weaning?",
        "Leonard: Yes, you are a super weaner.",
        "Sheldon: Well, now I have to correct you. As a bit of an elephant seal buff, the more accurate comparison would be when two mother seals actively seek to nourish the same pup. So I believe the term you're looking for is a double mother suckler.",
        "Leonard: Yeah, you're right. That is the term I'm looking for. You are a dirty double mother suckler.",
        "Sheldon: Okay, well, now that we have the terminology straightened out. How dare you.",
        "Penny: We're not in a rush. We'll set a date when the time is right.",
        "Mrs Cooper: It doesn't matter, sweetie. The moment a man lays with a woman, they are married in the eyes of the Lord.",
        "Dr Hofstadter: Uch.",
        "Mrs Cooper: Uch? The bible is uch to you?",
        "Dr Hofstadter: No, I'm sorry. That was inappropriate. As a psychiatrist, I know how important people's superstitions can be to them.",
        "Mrs Cooper: You want to talk about superstitions? Sheldon sent me the books you wrote, all that nonsense about superegos and ids. What bull dropped that on the barn floor?",
        "Dr Hofstadter: His name is Sigmund Freud.",
        "Penny: Hey, look at that. You both believe in Jewish bearded guys.",
        "Mrs Cooper: Stay out of this.",
        "Penny: Mm-hmm.",
        "Mrs Cooper: At least the bearded man that I believe in preaches love and compassion. All yours talks about is why you hold in your poop and want to crawl back inside your mama.",
        "Dr Hofstadter: It's fascinating. How can someone as enlightened as Sheldon come from someone like you?",
        "Mrs Cooper: I know the answer. You're not gonna like it.",
        "Dr Hofstadter: Try me.",
        "Mrs Cooper: When I was pregnant with Shelly, I was driving to church, and I was praying to the Lord to give me a son smarter than his dumb-ass daddy. And I looked over and I saw a Jesus bobblehead in the Subaru next to me nodding yes. What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Dr Hofstadter: : It means, I can't believe we're having this conversation.",
        "Mrs Cooper: Well, do it some more. Maybe you can knock some sense into yourself.",
        "Penny: Why don't we all stop hitting ourselves and talk about something safe, you know, like shoes or how cute little Chinese babies are.",
        "Sheldon: It is not my fault that your mother likes me better than she likes you.",

        "Sheldon: Well, you doled out affection as a reward for achievement, a proven way to raise a child. Or train a rat.",
        "Dr Hofstadter: But look how well you turned out.",
        "Sheldon: I'd feign modesty at this point, but who would believe me? Still, you need to consider how successful Leonard's brother and sister are.",
        "Dr Hofstadter: I suppose.",
