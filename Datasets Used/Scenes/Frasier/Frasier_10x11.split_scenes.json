    "Recap": [
        "Owing to an item of misdirected mail, Frasier learns of a very exclusive new spa in Seattle called La Porte d'Argent . When he discovers that membership is strictly by invitation only, he persuades Niles to masquerade as Cam Winston (whose name is on the list) so they can get past the receptionist. Once inside, they find the service expensive but excellent, and are quite contented until they discover that there is an even more exclusive gold membership. Roz calls in a favor to get the brothers admitted, and they enjoy the luxurious pampering - until they notice yet another door, this one completely unguarded. Believing it to be the entrance to an even higher level of membership, they sneak through only to find themselves locked out of the spa in its garbage-strewn back alley. At the same time, Martin and Daphne are struggling to bond after she became his daughter-in-law, finding a common fondness of old television shows like M*A*S*H ."

        "[N.B. This episode originally had a subplot about Daphne trying to expand her physical therapy clientele, featuring actress Ana Gasteyer as a physical therapist observing the techniques Daphne used with Martin. Director David Lee later said the subplot hadn't turned out as well as hoped, so the subplot was scrapped. Gasteyer returned to play housekeeper Trish Haney in [10.07] \"Bristle While You Work,\" which was filmed after this episode.]",

        "Martin: Ow! All right, all right, I'll talk! Just make the pain stop.",
        "Daphne: Oh, shut up. I'm just trying to get the blood flowing.",
        "Martin: Oh, more like make me hemorrhage.",
        "Daphne: Don't tempt me.",
        "Martin: Oh, God, you broke something!",
        "Daphne: Too bad it wasn't your bloody pie hole! There, we're done, you big baby.",
        "Martin: [genuinely disappointed] What, already? [rising] Oh, that felt great! Oh! I feel like a new man. I love your new table.",
        "Daphne: Oh, you're sweet. Can I make you a sandwich?",
        "Martin: Oh, that'd be great. Yeah. Oh, by the way, Daph, you know, they're showing the first-ever episode of Rockford today. If you're really serious about becoming an American citizen, maybe you ought to watch it.",
        "[Martin sits in his chair. Frasier and Niles enter. Frasier is holding an envelope.]",
        "Niles: Well, now you've opened it. That's mail theft.",
        "Frasier: Nonsense.",
        "Martin: What's going on?",
        "Frasier: Nothing. Just another piece of Cam Winston's mail has found its way into our box. It's been happening a lot since we switched mailboxes. Even after I gave the postman a stern lecture.",
        "Martin: Especially after.",
        "Frasier: Anyway, it was an honest mistake. Cam and I are on all the same mailing lists, and I'm sure mine is in his box. Besides, it's nothing personal, look, it's just an announcement for some place called La Porte d'Argent.",
        "Martin: Probably just another froufrou restaurant or froufrou clothing store.",
        "Frasier: No, no, no, this is not \"froufrou,\" Dad, as evidenced by the manly scent of balsam.",
        "Niles: [taking the letter and sniffing] Hmm.",
        "Frasier: They obviously deal with a very upscale clientele.",
        "Niles: Hmm. Oh! La Porte d'Argent! Someone at the racquet club was talking about this. It's very, very exclusive.",
        "Frasier: [excitedly] Yes?",
        "Niles: That's all I know. Some ill-mannered person started up his blow dryer before I could hear any more.",
        "Daphne: [entering from the kitchen with Martin's sandwich] Hello!",
        "Niles: Oh, Daphne, Daphne! Did I get one of these [holding up the announcement] in the mail today?",
        "Daphne: No, I don't think so.",
        "Frasier: [grabbing the announcement] Poor Niles.",
        "Daphne: What's this about?",
        "Martin: Oh, they're all worked up about some smelly invitation Frasier stole to some place they never heard of.",
        "Daphne: [unsurprised] Oh.",
        "Frasier: Yes, but that's what's so intriguing, Dad, that there exists an exclusive place in Seattle that neither of us knows about.",
        "[Niles picks up the phone and starts dialing.]",
        "Niles: [rising] It could be an art gallery, or a new haberdashery.",
        "Martin: Or an Italian shoelace boutique.",
        "[Daphne laughs at this.]",
        "Niles: What's happening?",
        "Frasier: It's a machine. It's asking me to enter my six-digit access code. What'll I do?",
        "Martin: Why don't you just punch in whatever keys spell out \"SNOBBY\"?",
        "[Frasier glares at him.]",
        "Niles: You know, it might be worth a try.",
        "[Frasier punches it in, listens, then grimaces.]",
        "Frasier: Oh, denied!",
        "Niles: Oh! The allure of the Porte D'Argent has increased tenfold!",
        "Frasier: All right, here's our plan. We go to the university computer lab, bribe some hungry hacker, and, once we've tapped into their mainframe, La Porte D'Argent will give up her sweet secret like a blushing bride on her wedding night!",
        "Martin: Why don't you just go down there and ask them what they do?",

        "Receptionist: Yes, it is.",
        "Frasier: Ah, good. Say, someone was asking me earlier today about La Porte D'Argent, and I had a difficult time characterizing it. What would you tell him?",
        "Receptionist: We try to discourage word of mouth.",
        "Frasier: That's exactly what I said. So, well, I'm here to take advantage of your offer.",
        "[He hands the invitation over.]",
        "Receptionist: Sure. Can I have your name, please?",
        "Frasier: Yes. Frasier Crane.",
        "Receptionist: [typing it into the computer] I'm not finding you.",
        "Frasier: Try Doctor Frasier Crane. Perhaps you've heard my popular radio show.",
        "Receptionist: I'm not really a radio person. I'm sorry Dr. Crane, you're not on the list, I can't let you in.",
        "Frasier: But I have an invitation.",
        "Receptionist: Yes, but you're not on the list.",
        "Frasier: Yes, but I do have an invitation!",
        "Receptionist: But you aren't on the LIST.",
        "Frasier: Yes, well, if I was on the list, I wouldn't need an invitation, I'd just say \"I'm on the list.\" Therefore, the invitation supercedes the list.",
        "Receptionist: No, invitations are given out only to those on the list.",
        "Frasier: Ah-ha. But you do concede that I do have a valid invitation?",
        "Receptionist: Yes.",
        "Frasier: Then it naturally follows that I would be on the list.",
        "Receptionist: But you're not.",
        "Frasier: Then how did I GET the invitation?",
        "Receptionist: I really don't know. You could have stolen it...",

        "[He gestures Niles over.]",
        "Niles: [in a deep voice] Hello, Frasier.",
        "Frasier: You know, while I was waiting for you, I decided to test the mettle of this young man. I'm pleased to report that he follows the rules of La Porte D'Argent to the letter.",
        "[He and Niles laugh heartily.]",
        "Frasier: Anyway, I am a guest of Mr. Cam Winston's here. He told me to meet him here, gave me the invitation and here I am.",

        "Niles: [still in a deep voice] Good gravy, this is fantastic!",
        "Frasier: Would you stop talking like that? That's the worst impersonation of Cam Winston I've ever heard.",
        "Niles: You've heard another one?",
        "Frasier: Of course not.",
        "Niles: Then it's the best!",

        "Frasier: Niles, I just wish you had tried the vusattasen aqua-treatment. I feel as if I'd had a rebirthing experience. I've never felt better in my life.",

        "Frasier: Nirvana ain't cheap. Well, it's worth it, I suppose. What do you say we make this a standing appointment, Niles?",
        "Niles: Well, I think we owe it to ourselves.",
        "Frasier: Yes.",
        "Clerk: I'd be happy to set that up. Now, I've also put together a personal La Porte D'Argent product system for each of you, based on the recommendations of your estheticians.",

        "Clerk: Ah, the mid-afternoon anti-stress spritz.",
        "Niles: [studying something] I've never even heard of eyelash conditioner.",

        "[He heads over, but the Senator has already gone through. Frasier presses on the door.]",
        "Clerk: I'm sorry. That area is restricted to our gold level members.",

        "Frasier: This is absurd! I am a member of every exclusive club in this entire town. You must have a reciprocal membership with one of them.",

        "Daphne: How'd you get that?",
        "Martin: Well, come on: he solves crimes, I solved crimes. We're both in tune with the beat of the street. He's the kind of guy that men want to be and women want to be with. When this show first came out, everybody used to say I was like Rockford.",
        "Daphne: I'm sorry, I don't see it. You still remind me of his dad.",
        "Martin: Rocky? But he's old. [realizing the implication] Oh, I see.",
        "Daphne: I didn't mean that. I just meant there's something about him that reminds me of you.",

        "[Frasier paces around as Niles goes to get sherry.]",
        "Frasier: It was a hell-hole! They had the nerve to call it a day spa, when it's nothing more than a mere front for a bona fide luxury spa which taunts those kept at bay outside its golden door!",
        "Martin: If you didn't go in, how do you know it's better?",

        "Niles: Oh, that's ridiculous. Plutonium's radioactive, no one's going to make a door out of it.",
