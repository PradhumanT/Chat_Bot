        "ACT ONE",
        "Scene One - Apartment The doorbell rings. Daphne opens the door to Roz, who is carrying Alice.",
        "Roz: Hey, Daphne.",
        "Daphne: Hello, Roz, Alice. What brings you here?",
        "Roz: We're borrowing Frasier's car.",
        "Daphne: Oh, I see. And you're leaving Alice here as collateral.",
        "Roz: Actually, he's being very nice about it. Mine's in the shop, and I'm taking Alice and a few of her friends to an ice cream party.",
        "Frasier: [emerging from hallway] You told me it was your friends, and the Science Center!",
        "Roz: He said, she said, we'll never know what really happened. Frasier, don't be so uptight. I'm not gonna hurt your precious car.",
        "Frasier: I am not uptight, it's just that I've had some unfortunate experiences before loaning out my car.",
        "Daphne: [going to the hall] I left an umbrella in the trunk.",
        "Frasier: It was a wet umbrella!",
        "Roz: Can I have the keys?",
        "Alice whines softly, prompting Frasier to take them out.",
        "Frasier: [sighs] Yes, yes. [drops them in her hand] After all, what are fine possessions for if not to be used and enjoyed? [lugubrious] And who better to enjoy them than the delightful souls of small children?",
        "Roz: I'll put a tarp in the backseat.",
        "Frasier: Oh, bless you.",
        "Roz turns to leave and runs into Niles.",
        "Niles: Hey Roz, hello Alice. What brings you here?",
        "Roz: Oh, Frasier loaned me his car, I backed mine into a telephone pole.",
        "Frasier: You said you were getting a tune-up!",
        "Roz: [as the elevator doors close] It needs one, trust me!",
        "Niles: Is, uh, Daphne ready?",
        "Frasier: Uh, actually I think she's in her room. You two have plans?",
        "Niles: Yes, I am taking her to the botanical gardens. Can you believe she's never been before?",
        "Frasier: Didn't Donny take her to the botanical gardens last year?",
        "Niles: Can you believe she's never been before?",
        "Daphne comes out with Eddie on a leash.",
        "Niles: Hey, Daphne!",
        "Daphne: Hello, Niles.",
        "Niles: Ready to go to the gardens?",
        "Daphne: Yeah, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take Eddie for a walk first.",
        "[kisses him]",
        "Niles: Where's Dad?",
        "Daphne: I don't know, he's been gone all morning.",
        "Niles: Oh well, here, I'll take him for a quick walk.",
        "Daphne: Oh no, he's gonna need more than that, or he'll go stir-crazy. He's gonna need a full hour at the dog park.",
        "Niles: [checks his watch] We don't have time to go the dog park, the-the Tour of Succulents starts promptly at twelve. Uh, hey, Frasier, can you take him?",
        "Frasier: No, I'm sorry, Niles. Roz has my car, you see, and Lana's coming by to pick me up for a tutoring session with Kirby.",
        "Daphne: I'll just get Eddie's toys. [leaves]",
        "Frasier: [on phone] Hello, this is Dr. Frasier Crane, I need to make an emergency appointment tomorrow, for a complete cleaning of my BMW. June 10th?! But I've got a Clean Team Privileges Card! Yes, of course it's a platinum one! [takes it out and looks] No, no there are no diamonds on the corner. Well, then yes, I'd like to become a member of the Diamond Alliance immediately. Fine, put me on the waiting list. I'll see you in June. [hangs up]",
        "Niles: [needling] You're not in the Diamond Alliance?",
        "Frasier: Don't do that!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Scene Two - Park Niles and Daphne are sitting together on a bench in the park, with Eddie. All around them are dogs playing with their owners.",
        "Niles: So this is it.",
        "Daphne: Mmm-hmm.",
        "Niles: I'd hardly call this a dog park. [looks around] It's more like a dog... orgy. Whose beagles are those?",
        "Daphne: Don't stare, it only encourages them.",
        "Niles: Well, hurry up, Eddie, there's lots of exciting depravity to explore. [Eddie doesn't move]",
        "Daphne: [takes out a short piece of thick rope] He wants to play a little fetch.",
        "Niles: Oh.",
        "Daphne: Well here, you throw it.",
        "Niles: With my bare hands?",
        "Daphne: Oh come on, it's fun.",
        "Niles: [takes it] Ready? Here we go. And, fetch!",
        "He tosses the rope about two feet away. Eddie quickly picks it up and brings it back.",
        "Niles: All right, I didn't give you enough of a challenge. Here, ready, ready? And, ho! [throws it farther] Go get it! [Eddie runs after it] I'm sorry, I was a bit of a grouch. This is actually a fine way to spend the day.",
        "Daphne: Yeah...",
        "Niles: In fact, it's kind of...",
        "He trails off as a huge hound comes back with the end of the rope hanging from his jaws.",
        "Niles: Hello. Do you suppose the rest of Eddie's in there?",
        "Jim, a tall, handsome, athletic man, follows the hound. Eddie follows him.",
        "Jim: Good boy, good boy! Sorry about that, Daphne, but what with the organic vitamin paste I've been feeding Tank here, Eddie can't keep up with him.",
        "Daphne: It's no problem, Jim. Uh, Niles, this is Jim Grady and Tank. This is Niles, my boyfriend.",
        "Niles: [shaking hands] Pleasure.",
        "Jim: Boyfriend? Ah, I should have known. It seems like every time I'm single you're in a relationship, and every time you're single I'm in a relationship.",
        "Daphne: Yeah, that's true.",
        "Jim: I guess we just don't have-",
        "Daphne: Timing!",
        "Jim: -good... [Daphne laughs] And I'm a drummer!",
        "Niles: Which, uh, makes it even more ironic!",
        "Tank starts climbing Niles's leg, to his horror.",
        "Jim: Tank, that's rude! Now, chill. [Tank obeys]",
        "Niles: Wow.",
        "Daphne: Wow, you've really got him trained. That's the problem with Eddie. He only listens when he thinks he's gonna get food.",
        "Niles: Or one of my socks! [laughs, no one else does] But mostly food.",
        "Jim: Well, it's all in the voice tone, really. Any dog can learn to respond to it, even an old wheezer like Eddie. You, uh, want me to show you?",
        "Daphne: I'd love it.",
        "Jim: Come on. [she gets up]",
        "Niles: Yeah, we'd all love it!",
        "He gets up to follow them, but his cell phone rings.",
        "Niles: Oh uh, you guys, uh... [but they're gone] Be right back. [sits and answers] Hello?!",
        "SMASH CUT TO: A close-up of Martin, dressed in a dark suit and talking on a mobile:",
        "Martin: Hi Niles, it's me. I just wanted to make sure Daphne took Eddie for a walk, I completely forgot about it this morning.",
        "Niles: Yeah, yeah, we're in the dog park now. Uh, where are you, anyway?",
        "The camera widens to show Martin seated at a table in a nondescript room. It looks a little like a canteen. In the background are two people in suits, conferring.",
        "Martin: Uh, I'm at the track. Uh, had an itch for it when I woke up, and so just I dropped everything and went. Uh, I'm at the window... [puts the phone to his shoulder] I'll have a trifecta in the eighth. [into phone] All right, gotta run.",
        "Niles: Wait, uh-",
        "Martin hangs up. He looks very pensive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "MR. HAPPY PANTS",
        "Scene Three - House Lana opens the door to the house, and Frasier follows her in.",
        "Frasier: Well, I didn't realize that I was going to be selling houses with you today! Why didn't you just drop me off and then come on your own?",
        "Lana: Stop whining! It'll only take a minute. I hope we don't run into the sad sack who owns this place.",
        "She notices some framed family pictures on the otherwise bare shelves, and quickly removes them to a box on the floor.",
        "Lana: I've been trying to sell this house for over a year! But he keeps driving away every potential buyer.",
        "Frasier: How does he do that?",
        "Phillip, the world's saddest man (judging by his unshaven face and filthy clothes) lumbers in carrying a box.",
        "Phillip: Oh... hi. I heard a woman's voice, I thought it might be my wife coming back to me.",
        "Lana: [as if to a child] No. She lives in Portland now, with her new husband, Lamar, remember? [Phillip nods sadly] Oh, excuse me, Frasier Crane, Phillip Donovan, the current owner.",
        "Frasier: Hello.",
        "Phillip: Hi.",
        "Lana: Well, see you later Phillip!",
        "Not seeming to hear her, Phillip puts the box on the floor and sinks onto the couch.",
        "Phillip: Anyway, my wife just left with the kids. No talking, no explanations, just ripped my heart out and threw it to the dogs - which she also took.",
        "Frasier: Well, uh, at least you're... getting out at the top of the market!",
        "Lana: Actually, this is a very good time, Phillip, and I think today is the day!",
        "Phillip: [opening the box] Oh, no!",
        "Lana: Oh, God!",
        "Frasier: What's wrong?",
        "Phillip: The damn basement must have flooded again. Everything in this box is ruined. Little Suzy's cap she wore home from the hospital, ruined; Danny's first soccer uniform, ruined!",
        "Frasier: Well, you know, I have an excellent drycleaner-",
        "Lana: [hissed] No!",
        "Frasier drops his coat onto a chair and sits beside Phillip on the couch.",
        "Frasier: Once, actually, I spilled butter on a pair of white velvet pantaloons. [off their looks] Well, it's a long story. But, uh, he had it out in under a minute!",
        "Lana: Frasier, just give him the address.",
        "Frasier: Yes, yes...",
        "Phillip: [shows him some pictures] I have two sons and two daughters. The perfect American family... until that b*st*rd Lamar showed up to snake our drains. Now all I have left are weekend visits, and a few treasures from their childhood.",
        "He takes out a popsicle stick house and puts it on the coffee table.",
        "Phillip: Like this house little Danny and I made at day camp. Oh, thank goodness, it made it through unscathed. Just a little water damage in the basement. Just like this house...",
        "Frasier: Phillip, you are still their father. I mean, I know things seem difficult right now, but believe me, it'll get easier.",
        "Phillip: Oh, it's already easier. I mean, look at me, I'm dressed.",
        "Lana: Phillip, you know what would really cheer you up, is to make a killing on this house! Now, don't you think you should get back to work?",
        "Phillip: I guess. That air traffic isn't gonna control itself. [gets up]",
        "Lana: OK, here we go. [he heads toward the front] No, not the front door! Let's go out the side door. [steers him] It's good to see you again, Phillip, I'll call you when we sell the place, bye!",
        "She shoves him out.",
        "Frasier: Good lord, that man is obviously in pain, the least you could be is a little sympathetic!",
        "Lana: I have been sympathetic for fifteen months! I had him over for Thanksgiving! He got drunk the first half-hour and cried himself to sleep in my coat closet! And I consider that one of our good days!",
        "Frasier: Well, so where are these so-called buyers of yours? You told me they'd be here in a few minutes.",
        "Lana: Well, they're obviously running late, OK? It'll give us time to go over the plan.",
        "Frasier: What, what, there's a plan?",
        "Lana: Well, sure. When the Smolenskis get here, you act like you want the house. You know, a little competition, put a little pressure on the deal.",
        "Frasier: You're asking me to be your shill?",
        "Lana: [slaps her forehead in mock surprise] That's the word! Yes, yes! Now listen, you don't have to say anything!",
        "Frasier: I'm sorry, no!",
        "Lana: Well, why not?! Well, look, OK, all you have to do is walk around with an interested look on your face. You know, they'll fill in the rest!",
        "Frasier: I will do no such thing!",
        "Lana: Why won't you help me?!",
        "Frasier: Because I refuse to lie for you!",
        "Lana: Oh fine, then go wait in the car!",
        "Frasier: I never wanted to leave the car!",
        "Lana: Oh, just get out!",
        "She grabs his coat and flings it at him, hitting the stick house and shattering it into a hundred pieces. They are both horrified.",
        "END OF ACT ONE",
        "ACT TWO",
        "Scene Four - House Lana is picking up the pieces. Frasier comes in the door with a grocery bag.",
        "Frasier: All right, I got some cream-sicles, and fudge-sicles, and something they call, uh, \"Bomb Pops!\"",
        "Lana: I called the Smolenskis, I bought us a little extra time.",
        "Frasier: Right, good, good. All right, let's spread out some paper and then build us a house!",
        "Lana: So Frasier, with all your talk about honesty, how do you justify faking this thing?",
        "Frasier: Well... we're simply protecting the feelings of an innocent man. Nothing dishonest about that.",
        "Lana: Uh-huh. [holds up a piece] So, uh, are you gonna write, \"I love you, Daddy\" or am I?",
        "Frasier: [It's a dirty job, but] I'll do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Scene Five - Park Daphne watches, delighted, as Tank obeys Jim's every command.",
        "Jim: Sit. Wave, wave. All right, hide your eyes, hide your eyes. Hide 'em...",
        "Niles and Eddie are sitting on the bench watching them. In his loneliness, Niles has begun to pet Eddie.",
        "Niles: Hey Eddie, don't worry about that other dog. He may be bigger and flashier and better-looking, but...you have substance. She knows that.",
        "Daphne: [coming back] How amazing is Jim? He's so connected to animals, it's almost magical.",
        "Niles: Daphne, I've been musing about you and me, and I have a thought.",
        "Daphne: Yeah?",
        "Niles: In every healthy relationship, I may ask for an occasional - very occasional - irrational demand.",
        "Daphne: What do you mean?",
        "Niles: Uh, a thing we insist the other do or not do, and the other one has to do it or not do it, without question.",
        "Daphne: Is that fair?",
        "Niles: It is. Because we each get one, and only one, for our whole relationship.",
        "Daphne: Well, if it's important to you.",
        "Niles: Then it's agreed?",
        "Daphne: Agreed.",
        "Niles: Good... oh, I've got mine!",
        "Daphne: Already?",
        "Niles: Yes. Uh, I want you to promise never to come to this dog park again.",
        "Daphne: What?",
        "Niles: I know it sounds extreme, even unreasonable - but that's the beauty of the irrational demand.",
        "Daphne: Is this about Jim?",
        "Niles: The, uh, demand cannot be scrutinized. It is, by definition, irrational.",
        "Daphne: And are you sure this is how you want to use your only one?",
        "Niles: Absolutely. I've thought this through, a lot. Irrationally, of course.",
        "Daphne: OK, if you're sure. I promise never to come to this dog park again.",
        "Niles: Thank you. I knew you'd understand. [kisses her]",
        "Jim and Tank come over.",
        "Jim: All right, we're going home. Tank needs to re-hydrate, and, oof, I'm late for a deltoid workout.",
        "Daphne: Well, I guess this is goodbye, Jim.",
        "Jim: Yep, by this time next week I'll be leading my first raft tour in Chile.",
        "Niles: Really?",
        "Jim: Yeah.",
        "Niles: Wow, when do you get back?",
        "Daphne: Oh, he's not coming back. He's moving there. [to Jim] Good luck, Jim.",
        "Jim: Yes, you too. [hugs her; to Niles] And, uh, stay cool, buddy.",
        "Niles: Oh, you know it.",
        "Jim and Tank leaves.",
        "Daphne: [sighs] I wonder how I'll use my irrational demand... oh, what's my rush? I've got years to think it over.",
        "Niles looks very nervous.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Scene Six - Waiting Room Martin is still seated in the waiting room. Joanne, a woman in her early 50's, comes in and sees him. They seem comfortable with each other, but nervous about something else.",
        "Joanne: Hi, Martin.",
        "Martin: Hello, Joanne.",
        "Joanne: How have you been?",
        "Martin: Pretty good. Oh please, have a seat.",
        "Joanne: Thanks. [sits] I was worried I was going to be late with all that construction going on.",
        "Martin: Yeah, I know, it's a mess.",
        "Joanne: How's your hip?",
        "Martin: Ah, you learn to live with it.",
        "Joanne: I think about you a lot, you know. I've wanted to call, but... I don't know.",
        "Martin: I understand, it's OK.",
        "Joanne: So... another year has gone by.",
        "Martin: Yeah. Time really flies.",
        "Joanne: I guess it goes a little slower for me.",
        "Silence.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Scene Seven - House Frasier and Lana are eating popsicles and finishing their new house, which is now only lacking a roof.",
        "Frasier: How's our roof coming?",
        "Lana: Almost done.",
        "Frasier: Good. [looks at her] You know, there was a time back in high school when I would have paid a thousand dollars to watch you eat a popsicle.",
        "She just looks at him with the popsicle in her mouth... and bites off the end, making him flinch.",
        "Frasier: It was a long time ago.",
        "Lana: I think it's kind of funny that we became friends.",
        "Frasier: We're friends?",
        "Lana: Well, sure we are. Why wouldn't you think so?",
        "The end of Frasier's popsicle falls off and dribbles down his shirt.",
        "Frasier: Oh, dear...",
        "Lana: Nice going, dipstick! [takes a tissue and wipes his shirt]",
        "Frasier: It's a brand-new shirt.",
        "Engine noises outside.",
        "Lana: I hear a car. It's the Smolenskis. [gets up] OK, keep working.",
        "Frasier: Right.",
        "Lana: I gotta go up to Phil's room and spray some air freshener around. His room reeks of... I don't know, despair!",
        "She leaves the room. Frasier, before resuming work, takes the scissors and cuts a hole in the middle of a large piece of wall-paper on the floor, and puts it over his head as a smock, all the while holding the popsicle in his mouth.",
        "As he resumes, the elderly Smolenskis come in.",
        "Mrs. Smolenski: It's even nicer than I remember!",
        "They see him - a grown man wearing a huge paper smock, glueing sticks together and sucking on a popsicle.",
        "Mrs. Smolenski: Well, hello there! Are you having fun making your little house?",
        "Frasier, mouth engaged, is unable to reply. Lana comes in.",
        "Lana: Oh, there you are! Hi - oh, I see you've met Frasier. I am so glad you came today, because the interest on this place is really heating up!",
        "Mr. Smolenski: Well, we're certainly interested as well, but we've- we've heard that a lot of homes in this area have a flooding problem. Now, what do you know about the basement here?",
        "Lana: Honestly?",
        "Mr. Smolenski: Yes.",
        "Lana: This house is sixty years old, and I have only heard of it flooding once.",
        "Mr. Smolenski: Oh!",
        "Frasier clears his throat loudly.",
        "Lana: And I could tell you for a fact that the permanent owner stores some of his most cherished keepsakes in that basement.",
        "Frasier makes a hacking cough.",
        "Mrs. Smolenski: Are you choking on your lolly?",
        "Frasier: [takes out popsicle] No. I am choking on something far more dangerous and destructive than a simple sugary treat. It's a prolific and powerful poison",
        "known as: deception!",
        "Mrs. Smolenski: He's very verbal!",
        "Even from within his smock, Frasier manages to look righteous and accusing.",
        "Lana: Oh, you know, I just remembered! Gosh, you know, the owner did mention something about a recent little moisture problem downstairs. Tell you what, why don't I give him a call and see if he'll come down just a tiny bit in the price?",
        "Mrs. Smolenski: Oh, that'd be wonderful!",
        "Mr. Smolenski: If he could give us a break in the price, I'm sure we'll make an offer.",
        "Lana: Oh, great! I'll call you tonight.",
        "Mrs. Smolenski: Thank you.",
        "Mr. Smolenski: [to Frasier] Bye, sonny.",
        "Lana: [as they leave] Call you tonight!",
        "She closes the door. Frasier has placed the roof on the house.",
        "Frasier: There now, you see? You did the right thing. That wasn't so bad, was it?",
        "Lana: I guess not. Oh, look at our little house, it looks great!",
        "They start cleaning up, putting their supplies in the grocery bag.",
        "Frasier: Say, you know, we got a few extra popsicle sticks left, why don't we add on a half a bath?",
        "Lana laughs. Frasier heads for the side door, then stops and turns back.",
        "Frasier: You know, Lana, I think the house should go the other way around - with the door facing the couch. [off her look] Feng Shui!",
        "Lana: Fine, fine, fine, fine.",
        "He leaves the room. Lana lifts the house - and the coffee table comes with it. She tries again, without luck. She braces the table with her legs, and tugs. Nothing.",
        "Making a rapid decision, she lifts the coffee table and turns it around so the door is now facing the couch. Frasier comes back.",
        "Frasier: Ah, perfect.",
        "Lana: Perfect.",
        "Frasier: Now you see, doesn't it feel good to tell the truth? It's like breathing a breath of fresh air, and-",
        "Lana: Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go!",
        "Frasier: Oh, all right.",
        "They go out the door.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "MOMMIE DEAREST",
        "Scene Eight - Apartment Roz steps off the elevator carrying Alice. She kneels down and stands Alice opposite her.",
        "Roz: OK, Alice, before we see Uncle Frasier, let's remember together what really happened.",
        "ALICE'S P.O.V. - Her mother looking straight at her.",
        "Roz: Now, did you throw up in Uncle Frasier's car? Alice shakes her head from side to side.",
