    "Recap": [
        "Frasier is in Caf\u00e9 Nervosa trying to decide whether to wear a smart suit or a casual sweater to go speed dating. The episode has two parallel storylines, which interchange throughout. They diverge at the point where he makes the decision: in the first, he chooses the suit, and meets and dates a woman called Monica, who breaks up with him after he treats the relationship too intensely. Daphne decides to cook a special meal for Niles, but accidentally includes an ingredient he is allergic to. As a result, he falls ill which ruins a surprise trip to Cancun he had planned for the two. In the second storyline, Frasier chooses the sweater, and goes speed dating but has a miserable evening. Daphne and Niles prepare for their trip to Cancun, as Fraiser told Daphne about Niles' allergy before she put the ingredient in. Roz arranges a blind date for Frasier, who turns out to be one of the women he encountered speed dating. The two storylines converge when both versions of Frasier, after listening to an enamored caller on a repeat broadcast of his show, decide to make a U-turn towards the restaurant where the caller had mentioned she was the chef and had suggested meeting her there any time. During the credits scene, Martin ends up doing the same thing in both scenarios: relaxing in his chair, drinking beer, and petting Eddie."

        "Frasier and Roz are having coffee together.",
        "Frasier: All right, if you must know, I'm just about to leave for something called a \"speed date.\"",
        "Roz: What's a speed date?",
        "Frasier: Well, apparently it's the latest thing: twelve men and twelve women get together in a room. They spend eight minutes talking to one other and then move on to the next person after a bell rings. Basically, it's all the stress and humiliation of a blind date... times twelve.",
        "Roz: Wow, talk about desperate. So what brought this on?",
        "Frasier: Well, I'm just so tired of being surrounded by happy couples, I just thought I should do something a bit more proactive.",
        "Roz: You wouldn't be talking about Niles and Daphne, would you?",
        "Frasier: Oh, among others. Believe me, no one could be happier for Niles than I, but there are days when his lovesick swain act wears the tiniest bit thin.",
        "Niles walks up. He is carrying a shopping bag and his jacket. He is wearing a t-shirt (!) that has a heart-shaped picture of Daphne and him on it surrounded by red hearts. He has a huge grin on his face.",
        "Niles: Hello, all. He holds a pose in front of them. Frasier rolls his eyes.",
        "Niles: Notice anything different?",
        "Roz: I like it.",
        "Niles: Thank you. I've never worn an undergarment in public before.",
        "Frasier: Is that my sweater?",
        "Niles: Oh, yes, here. What's the emergency?",
        "He hands over the bag and sits.",
        "Frasier: Well, actually, I was going out this evening and I was thinking about changing my attire. While the suit projects a certain professionalism, you know \"Dr. Frasier Crane,\" I was thinking perhaps the sweater could impart a more casual feel, \"Just Fraizh.\" [He holds the sweater up.] Any thoughts?",
        "Roz: [after a beat, she turns to Niles] So I bet you and Daphne have big Valentine's Day plans.",
        "Niles: Oh, yes. She's cooking dinner for me and then I've a big surprise planned. I'm taking her to Cancun for a long romantic weekend.",
        "Roz: Not bad!",
        "Niles: Yes, I'm whisking her to the airport in a limo filled with exotic orchids. You don't think that's a too over the top, do you?",
        "Roz: No, I think that boat sailed with your t-shirt.",
        "Frasier: Here's an idea: what if put the sweater under the jacket? Then I'll get the best of both worlds.",
        "Niles: [rising] Honestly, Frasier, could you be more self-absorbed? Goodbye, Roz. If you want to know more about our trip, we'll have pictures on our website when we get back.",
        "He leaves. Roz turns back to Frasier who is still fussing with the sweater.",
        "Roz: Oh, for God's sake, Frasier, flip a coin.",
        "Frasier: I know this may seem like nothing to you, Roz, but the tiniest decision can shape your whole destiny. So, which path should I follow? [He begins raising and lowering the sweater in front of himself.] Sweater? Suit. Sweater? Suit. Sweater?",
        "Roz: [grabbing her head] Oh just pick one!",
        "Frasier: Fine, you're right. Okay, fine. We'll go with... the suit.",
        "He puts the sweater back in the bag and rises.",
        "Roz: You made the right choice.",
        "Frasier: Wish me luck.",
        "He starts to walk out, but bumps into a man (Mike) getting up from a stool at the counter.",
        "Frasier: Oh, I'm sorry. Pardon me. Say, don't you work at KACL?",
        "Mike: Yeah, I just started. Mike Schafer.",
        "They shake hands.",
        "Frasier: Oh, hi, Mike. Frasier Crane. Have you met Roz Doyle?",
        "Mike: No.",
        "Frasier: Oh, you are new, aren't you?",
        "Roz gives him a look.",
        "Roz: Can I buy you a cup of coffee?",
        "Frasier again turns to leave. However, a young woman (Monica) spills a cup of coffee as she hands it to a waitress is holding and jumps up, backing her chair into him and knocking him to the floor.",
        "Monica: Oh, my god.",
        "Roz: Frasier! Are you okay?",
        "She helps him up.",
        "Frasier: Well, I - ow! Gosh, I think I've wrenched my shoulder.",
        "Monica: Oh, I am so sorry.",
        "Frasier: No, that's all right. Ow!",
        "Monica: Oh, I'm taking you to the emergency room. Please, it's the least I can do.",
        "Roz: Frasier, I have my car right outside, I'll take you.",
        "Frasier gives her a meaningful look.",
        "Frasier: Roz, don't you have coffee waiting? [He turns to Monica.] Hi, I'm Frasier.",
        "Monica: I'm... Monica. You must think I'm such a klutz!",
        "Frasier: No, not at all.",
        "They exit and then the entire scene SLIDES to the right and we are back at the point where Frasier is deciding on his attire. (UNIVERSE 2)",

        "Frasier: No, no, the sweater.",
        "Roz: You made the right choice.",
        "Mike gets up, not running into Frasier, but colliding with Monica as she spills the cup and jumps up.",
        "Monica: Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.",
        "Mike: That's okay, no harm done.",
        "Frasier: Good lord, what a klutz. All right, Roz, wish me luck.",
        "Roz: Good luck!",

        "Monica: You know, you're not the first guy I've sent to the emergency room.",
        "Frasier: Ah.",
        "Monica: When I was ten my brother fell off my handlebars and broke his foot. Then, in art school, a pottery wheel got away from me and sort of rolled down some stairs and I broke one guy's knee and another guy's hip.",
        "Frasier: I suppose after that you went on a kiln spree.",
        "Monica: Uh, yeah. I guess you could say I've broken more than my share of bones.",
        "Frasier: And more than your fair share of hearts, I'm sure.",
        "Monica: I don't know about that.",
        "She leans against a cart and it rolls back to bang into the wall.",

        "Frasier: Yes, I do.",
        "Judy: That's sort of my test joke, you know, to see if a guy's cool or not? Can you believe it, you're the first guy here who laughed? I mean, can't you just see it: a pirate walks into a movie theater, he's got his eye patch and his peg leg and...",

        "Martin: That's nice.",

        "Martin: Oh, I'm sorry, Son. Well, you get any phone numbers?",
        "Frasier: No, but if I ever want to track any of them down, I can always write them, care of... the bottom of the barrel.",
        "He takes off his name tag. There is a knock at the door.",

        "Frasier opens the door to reveal Daphne who is holding three bags of groceries.",

        "Frasier: You're really loadin' up, aren't you?",
        "Daphne: It's for Niles' Valentine's dinner.",
        "Frasier: Oh, that's not 'til next week.",
        "Daphne: Yeah, but it's a complicated recipe. I need to practice. You two are going to be my guinea pigs.",
        "She heads into the kitchen.",
        "Martin: Maybe we can fake our own deaths. Frasier notices something in one of the bags and reaches for it.",
        "Frasier: Daphne? Are you planning on using cumin in this recipe?",
        "Daphne: Yeah, the recipe calls for lots of it.",
        "Frasier: Oh, lord, Niles is terribly allergic to cumin.",
        "Daphne: Oh, dear. I knew about the scallops. And the nutmeg, the oat bran, wheat germ, carob, parchment mites...",
        "Frasier: Yes, yes, I know. He tried to wearing an allergy tag, but his neck was too weak to support it.",
        "The phone rings.",
        "Martin: [rising] D'you see that? The character in this movie dialed the phone and at the exact same time, our phone rang. It's like Montgomery Cliff's callin' me.",
        "Frasier: Yes, that's fascinating, Dad.",
        "He goes to stare out the window and then sits at the piano.",
        "Martin: Hello? Oh, hey, Niles. [he looks towards the kitchen] No, she can't hear. Ah, geez. I don't know about that. Well, all right, if it means that much to you, I'll do it. Yeah, bye.",
        "He hangs up.",
        "Martin: That was your brother. He wants me to pack a suitcase for Daphne for her trip to Cancun. Now I'm gonna have to go through her unmentionables.",
        "Frasier: I wonder if I'll ever see another unmentionable.",
        "Martin: Ah, come on, Frasier, it was just one bad date.",
        "Frasier: It was twelve bad dates. And a hundred before that. [he lightly plays the piano and starts singing] I'm through with love... I'll never call again...",
        "Daphne comes in from the kitchen to set the table.",
        "Martin: You're gonna be like this all night, aren't you? [to Daphne] It breaks my heart to see him like this. Fortunately, I can't see him from McGinty's.",

        "Martin: Oh, I'm sorry son. [he turns and sees Frasier's arm] What happened? Are you all right?",
        "Frasier: Actually, I tripped and sprained my shoulder, but I'm actually feeling no pain because I met a beautiful young woman.",
        "Martin: Oh, is she a nurse?",
        "There is a knock at the door.",
        "Frasier: No, she's the girl that tripped me. Her name is Monica, she's a commercial artist, she's cute as a button, and she's a danger to herself and others.",
        "He opens the door to reveal Daphne holding the groceries.",
        "Frasier: Oh, hi, Daph.",

        "Martin: Bullet in the hip.",
        "Daphne: You still have one good arm, Dr. Crane.",
        "Frasier: The doctor told me to take it easy.",
        "Daphne struggles to fit all the bags through the door.",
        "Frasier: Oh, I met a girl today!",
        "Daphne: [heading to the kitchen] Yeah, so did she.",
        "Frasier: You know what? It might be a bit soon, but I think I'm gonna give Monica a call.",
        "He pulls out his cell phone as the apartment phone rings.",
        "Martin: [rising] D'you see that? The character in this movie dialed the phone and at the exact same moment, our phone rings. It's like Montgomery Cliff's callin' me.",

        "Martin: Hello? Oh, hey, Niles. [he looks towards the kitchen] No, she can't hear. ... Ah, geez. I don't know about that.",
        "Frasier: Hi, Monica. Yeah, injured anybody lately? [he laughs] Really? I was calling because I thought maybe we could have dinner tomorrow night. I don't know, maybe we could meet at Caf\u00e9 Nervosa around seven and go from there? Wonderful. Great. I'll see you tomorrow. Goodnight.",
        "He hits the disconnect and laughs smugly.",

        "Frasier: So we had dinner again on Thursday night, and then again on Friday. She had plans with her parents on Saturday, so, to keep our streak alive, I actually sent her a videotape of me eating and talking into the camera.",
        "Roz: That's cute!",
        "Frasier: You don't think it's a little too much?",
        "Roz: No. If you like her, go for it.",
        "Frasier: So how are things with Mike?",
        "Roz: Good. He's taking me to the Heart Association benefit for Valentine's Day.",
        "Frasier: I'm going too. You know Roz, I think this a first: you and I in happy relationships at the same time.",
        "They touch cups and drink. Monica comes in.",
        "Monica: Hey, Roz. Hi Frasier. How's your head?",
        "Frasier: [rising] Uh, it's better actually. My peripheral vision's coming back.",
        "Monica: [laughing] Oh, good. So sorry. Listen, everyone at work's talking about the beautiful flowers you sent me. Thank you.",
        "Frasier: Wait 'til you see what's coming next. You won't be able to thank me in public.",
        "Monica: Frasier, I hate to break it to you, but you don't have to keep sending me flowers and poetry. You officially have my attention.",
        "They kiss.",
        "Monica: I'm gonna get some coffee.",
        "Frasier: Oh, let me get that for you.",
        "Monica: No. You're sweet, but I think I can get my own coffee.",
        "Roz: Looks like all that hard work you've been doing is paying off.",
        "Frasier: Well, I'm not about to let up now. I never want her to feel as if she's being taken for granted.",
        "Roz: Wow. You're giving Niles a run for his money.",
        "Frasier: Oh, please. In the great golden book of love, Niles will be a mere footnote to my glorious saga. I'm gonna take his ball and run it to the end zone. [then, nervously] Is that a thing?",

Last year McGinty hired this fat guy in a diaper to go around shooting a bow and arrow at people. No, wait. That might have been the Super Bowl.",
        "Frasier: You had me right up until \"diaper,\" Dad.",
        "Niles and Daphne hurry in from the kitchen, giggling.",

        "Martin: Roz find you a date for tonight?",
        "Frasier: Yeah, she's going with some guy lives in her building, he's got a sister.",
        "Martin: Hey, you oughta go. Beats hangin' around here feeling sorry for yourself.",
        "Frasier: Dad, please. The only thing worse than a blind date would be a blind date on Valentine's Day. Okay? I couldn't imagine a worse way to spend an evening.",
        "Niles and Daphne again come from the kitchen, giggling even louder.",
        "Niles: You have to see this!",
        "He and Daphne take a spaghetti noodle and each start on one end. They eat until they meet in the middle, a la the scene from \"Lady and the Tramp.\"",

        "Martin: You're really layin' it on thick, aren't ya?",
        "Frasier: Oh, God, Dad, you don't know the half of it. This morning she was awakened by a string quartet on her porch. Then, when Monica arrived at her office, there were seven dozen roses on her desk. A dozen for every day that I've known her.",
