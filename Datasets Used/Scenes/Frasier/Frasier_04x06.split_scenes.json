        "Daphne breaks up with her boyfriend Joe. Niles decides to tell Daphne how he feels about her, but Frasier persuades him to wait for a day in order to consider it. The next day, Niles arrives at the apartment with a large bouquet of flowers, only to find that the previous night Daphne met a man called Rodney at a singles bar, whom she intends to go out with. Niles is despondent, but determined not to let it get him down, and asks Roz to take him to the same singles bar, where he meets a woman called Adelle. Rodney proves to be very similar in character to Niles, though neither Daphne nor Niles seem to realise it. Frasier and Niles later see him in Caf\u00e9 Nervosa with Adelle."

        "ACT ONE",
        "Scene One \u0096 Frasier's Apartment Frasier is looking through the telescope. Niles fidgets beside him. Martin is reading the paper in his Armchair.",
        "Frasier: Oh my God... breathtaking.",
        "Niles: Well, don't be greedy! Your turn was over forty seconds ago!",
        "Frasier: All right, all right, Niles, all right. [steps away] It's the penthouse unit, fourth from the left.",
        "Niles: [looking] Oh, mama!",
        "Martin: You two know that what you're doing isn't right, don't you?",
        "Frasier: We're simply admiring a very rare Brancusi armchair, not a naked woman.",
        "Martin: That's what I'm talking about.",
        "Daphne comes in the front door, dressed for an evening out.",
        "Martin: Oh, hi, Daph.",
        "Daphne: Evening.",
        "Martin: You're home kind of early, aren't you?",
        "Daphne: A bit. Something... sort of happened.",
        "Martin: Oh, yeah? What?",
        "Daphne: Well, Joe and I were having dinner. Everything was nice as could be, and I said, \"Don't you like your potato?\" And he said, \"No, I'm not hungry for potato just now.\" So I said, \"Well, if you don't like your potato you're welcome to try my potato\"\u0097",
        "Frasier: Daphne? Could we hasten to the post-potato portion of the dialogue?",
        "Daphne: Well, that's when he said it. He said we'd been \"on-again, off-again\" for too long without making anything permanent, so maybe it was best if we just broke up.",
        "Martin: Oh, gosh, I'm sorry. You're sure taking it well. Boy, if you'd have told me Joe would end up dumping you tonight, I'd have been\u0097",
        "Daphne: Oh, God. He dumped me!",
        "She bursts into tears.",
        "Martin: Somebody comfort her!",
        "Niles: Right!",
        "He moves to hug Daphne, obviously anxious for the opportunity. But Frasier gets there first. She cries against his shoulder.",
        "Daphne: Oh, this is so embarrassing.",
        "Frasier: Oh, no, no, never mind about that. Expressing our emotions is always beneficial, even if it does come at the expense of our pride [she blows her nose on his lapel] and a very expensive brand-new Italian silk jacket.",
        "She keeps bawling.",
        "Frasier: You know, I don't seem to be doing much good here. Why don't one of you give it a try?",
        "Niles: Very well.",
        "Niles moves to hug her again, but this time Martin gets there first.",
        "Martin: Now, Daphne, it's all right. You're better off without him. That guy was a bum.",
        "Daphne: He was the best thing in my life!",
        "Martin: Oh. Well, maybe you two weren't meant for each other, you know? I mean, you're a champagne-and-caviar sort of gal, he's a meat-and-potatoes guy.",
        "Daphne: [crying at the memory] Potatoes!",
        "Martin: I'm messing up, too.",
        "Niles: I've got it, Dad.",
        "He moves a third time, but the doorbell rings.",
        "Daphne: I'll get it!",
        "She moves away, leaving Niles very frustrated. She opens the door to Roz.",
        "Roz: Hey, Daphne!",
        "Daphne: [a cry of pain] Roz...",
        "Roz: Oh my God, you got dumped! [hugs her; over her shoulder, to Frasier] Did you make her answer the door?",
        "Frasier: It's what she does!",
        "Roz: [to Daphne] Oh, it's all right, come on.",
        "Daphne: I'm sorry about this. I guess I'm still at the point where I can't hear his name without crying.",
        "Niles: You hear that, everyone? No one mention the name \"Joe!\"",
        "Daphne starts crying again. Niles eagerly moves in, but Frasier holds him back and bats his arm. Roz takes Daphne to her room.",
        "Frasier: Brandy, Niles?",
        "Niles: Uh, yes. Thank you. Frasier? I've just made an important decision. I'm going to tell Daphne how I feel about her.",
        "Frasier: What?",
        "Niles: I'm going to tell her tonight.",
        "Frasier: You're serious about this?",
        "Niles: I'm dead serious. Maris and I are nowhere near reconciling. I know this is the right decision, because I'm completely calm about it. Look.",
        "He holds out his hand to show that it's steady. However, the other hand, which is resting on Frasier's African sculpture, shakes violently, rattling the statue.",
        "Niles: Perhaps I'll take that brandy.",
        "Frasier: Niles, before you do anything this rash, you should consider it first from all angles.",
        "Niles: I've spent three years considering Daphne from all angles.",
        "Frasier: I'm just not sure this is the right moment for this.",
        "Niles: No, no, if you're trying to rattle me it's not going to work. I've been rehearsing this for months. \"Daphne, there's something I need to talk to you about. It's a matter of... Daphne, for a long time now, uh... you and I, we\" \u0097 exactly how's the brandy getting here, by St. Bernard?!",
        "Frasier: Niles, I just think that you should consider Daphne's state of mind. She's still reeling from her breakup with Joe. Listen, why don't you give it one more day?",
        "Niles: A day?",
        "Frasier: A day. Just one day, please! You've waited this long, another day won't make a difference.",
        "Niles: All right.",
        "Roz brings Daphne out.",
        "Roz: Now, Daphne, if the jewelry wasn't that good and the s*x wasn't that good, what have you really lost here?",
        "Daphne starts crying again.",
        "Frasier: Dr. Roz wades in with the \"Gabor approach\" to therapy!",
        "Roz: I am taking Daphne out and getting her mind off her troubles. Here's your tape. [puts it on the table]",
        "Frasier: Oh, thank you, Roz.",
        "Daphne: I want to thank you both for being so supportive.",
        "Frasier: Oh, Daphne, nonsense. You know, after three years, you're really a member of the family.",
        "The phone rings.",
        "Daphne: [still crying] I'll get it. She crosses the room to get it. Roz advances on Frasier, glaring.",
        "Frasier: It's what she does!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Scene Two \u0096 Frasier's Apartment The next morning. Martin is reading the paper at the table, Frasier is looking through his CD's.",
        "Martin: What are the Sonics thinking last night? If you're two for fifteen from behind the arc, why do you still give it to your two-guard instead of jamming it down to your big man in the paint?",
        "Pause.",
        "Frasier: Eddie, I believe that question was directed at you.",
        "Martin: You know, if you took an interest in sports, I bet you'd end up enjoying it. It's got drama, it's got graceful stuff...",
        "Frasier: Thank you, Dad, but frankly I'm quite satisfied with the likes of Pavorotti's Pagliacci. You have your big man in the paint, I have mine.",
        "The doorbell rings. Frasier opens the door to Niles, who is holding a large bouquet of flowers against his chest.",
        "Frasier: Niles.",
        "Niles: Frasier.",
        "Frasier: Either your boutonniere is way over the top, or you're here to execute last night's plan.",
        "Niles: Look, I know I don't have your total support in this, but... how shall I put this?",
        "Frasier: You don't care?",
        "Niles: If you could work the phrase \"rat's ass\" into there, you'd have it. The fact is, I'm tired of being lonely, and it makes no sense going on being lonely when the woman I long for is unattached.",
        "Frasier: Yes, well, as I said to you at the time you tried to jump out of the tree house with an umbrella, \"I suppose you know what you're doing.\"",
        "Martin emerges from the kitchen with a bowl of potato chips.",
        "Martin: Hey, Niles.",
        "Niles: Hey, Dad.",
        "The phone rings.",
        "Frasier: [answering] Hello? Oh, just a second, please. Dad, is Daphne in her room?",
        "Martin: Gee, I don't know. [screaming] DAPHNE! HEY, DAPH! DAPHNE!",
        "Frasier: For God's sake, I can yell! [into phone] Would you hold, please?",
        "Frasier goes to the hallway.",
        "Martin: I've been waiting thirty years to do that.",
        "Niles: You're probably wondering what I'm doing with these flowers.",
        "Martin: Well, now that you mention it\u0097",
        "Niles: Well, I'll tell you. They're for Daphne. I'm going to tell her how I feel about her.",
        "Martin: Oh, that's great, Niles.",
        "Niles: \"That's great?\"",
        "Martin: Well, yeah. You're single now. She's single. What's the problem?",
        "Niles: [laughing] That's so funny.",
        "Martin: What is?",
        "Niles: That's just not the reaction I expected. I thought you'd say something more Dad-like, like...",
        "Martin: You're out of your mind?",
        "Niles: [laughing] Yes.",
        "Martin: She's never gonna go for it in a million years?",
        "Niles: [still laughing] Stop it!",
        "Martin: Someday you're gonna look back on this as the stupidest, most idiotic\u0097",
        "Niles: [not laughing] I said stop it, Dad.",
        "Daphne and Frasier come out. Niles gets up and coyly hides the flowers behind his back.",
        "Daphne: Morning, Dr. Crane.",
        "Niles: Hello, Daphne.",
        "Daphne: Oh, don't you look nice. [picks up phone] Hello? Yes, Rodney, I'm so glad you called! Yes, I enjoyed meeting you too. Oh, well, yes, that would be lovely. I'll see you around four, then. Bye. [hangs up]",
        "Frasier: Rodney?",
        "Daphne: Yes, you won't believe this. Last night, Roz insisted on taking me to this bar she calls \"The Sure Thing.\"",
        "Frasier: How flattering. They've named a bar after her.",
        "Daphne: She says that whenever she takes a friend there, they always end up meeting someone. Well, I wasn't there ten minutes when she spun my barstool around and I was face-to-face with this nice-looking man.",
        "Martin: Rodney?",
        "Daphne: Right! I suppose it's a bit soon for me to be seeing anyone else. But, if I wait, he might not be available when I'm ready.",
        "Niles: Timing is everything.",
        "Daphne: I can't wait to tell Roz!",
        "She runs off to the hallway.",
        "Niles: \"Give it a day, Niles.\" I believe that was your brilliant advice?",
        "Frasier: I'm sorry, Niles, I really am. I don't know what to say.",
        "Niles: [dropping the flowers on the table] Too bad you didn't have that problem last night.",
        "Martin: Don't let it get you down.",
        "Niles: I'm not going to. I still have a fallback position. [grabs Frasier's rolodex and starts flipping through it] I'm going to call Roz and have her take me to that bar tonight!",
        "Frasier: Niles, really \u0097 a singles bar? Please, you're not thinking clearly. That's not exactly your arena, is it? Listen, why don't you just give it a day and think it over... [off Niles's glare] Here, let me dial that for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "WHERE EVERYBODY KNOWS HER NAME",
        "Scene Three \u0096 Granville's An upscale singles bar \u0097 piano, bar with stools, tables. It's sparsely populated. Roz is sitting at the bar. Niles comes up behind her, slightly frazzled.",
        "Niles: Well, I'm here. I forgot to gargle, I'm wearing mismatched socks, and I'm so nervous I could wet myself.",
        "Roz: Well, at least we have your opening line down.",
        "Niles: You're going to have to be patient with me, Roz. This isn't exactly my milieu.",
        "Roz: O.K., let's make that lesson number one. If you're going to use words like \"milieu,\" you might as well show up here with a sore on your lip and a couple of kids.",
        "Niles: Point well taken.",
        "Roz: Will you sit down and relax? [he sits next to her] You're gonna be fine. There's just a few little rules you need to know. First, when you introduce yourself, be as casual as possible. Second, you cannot say enough nice things about her hair. I know that sounds shallow, but it really works. And third, hang on her every word \u0097 be fascinated. Now go.",
        "Niles: What do you mean, \"go\"?",
        "Roz: It's time.",
        "Niles: I'm not ready.",
        "Roz: Oh, I've thrown a lot of little babies in the water and they've all come up swimming. Now go.",
        "Niles: No, no, I couldn't possibly, not yet, I need to\u0097",
        "She spins his barstool around, bringing him face-to-face with an attractive blond woman (Adelle).",
        "Niles: Hello.",
        "Adelle: Hello.",
        "Niles: Hope I'm not bothering you.",
        "Adelle: No, not at all. I'm Adelle.",
        "Niles: Niles. [shakes her hand] So, \"Adelle\"... is that with one \"l\" or two?",
        "Adelle: Two.",
        "Niles: [fascinated] Really?",
        "He props an elbow up on the bar and rests his head on his hand. Roz smiles, thinking, \"I've thrown him off the roof and he's flying!\"",
        "END OF ACT ONE",
        "ACT TWO",
        "STAREMASTER",
        "Scene Four \u0096 Frasier's Apartment It's evening. Frasier and Eddie are seated opposite each other at the dinner table, having a stare-down contest. Martin comes out.",
        "Martin: You're wasting your time.",
        "Frasier: No, I'm not.",
        "Martin: You're not gonna win.",
        "Frasier: It's time he learned what it's like to be stared at all the time. Bring it on, Buster, you got nothing. You can't touch me, I'm \u0097 Gaah! [breaks away, clutching his eyes] It's like his eyes turned into sorcerer's pinwheels and started spinning!",
        "The doorbell rings.",
        "Martin: Just shake hands and say \"good fight.\"",
        "Frasier considers doing it for a second, then decides not. Martin opens the door to Niles and Adelle, dressed for an evening out.",
        "Martin: Oh, hi, Niles! Come on in.",
        "Niles: Dad, this is Adelle Childs \u0097 my father Martin.",
        "Martin: Nice to meet you. [shakes her hand]",
        "Niles: And this is my brother, Frasier.",
        "Frasier: It's so nice to finally meet you.",
        "Adelle: Nice to meet you.",
        "Niles: Are you all right? Your eyes look funny.",
        "Frasier: Oh, I'm fine, it's just \u0097 oh, here are your tickets. [gives them to Niles]",
        "Niles: Thank you.",
        "Frasier: Say, have you got time for a coffee before you go?",
        "Adelle: That'd be nice.",
        "Frasier: Splendid! Gives me a chance to debut my Limoges coffee set \u0097 a series of six unique cups, each one representing a different wife of Henry VIII. My antique dealer just found an \"Anne of Cleves\" to complete the set!",
        "Frasier goes to the kitchen.",
        "Martin: He loves to rub it in. I'm still looking for a \"Wilma\" to complete my juice glass set.",
        "Niles: I'll lend you a hand. [to Adelle] Excuse me.",
        "In the kitchen, Niles comes in to have a man-to-man with Frasier.",
        "Niles: So, what do you think?",
        "Frasier: She seems very nice.",
        "Niles: She's fabulous. I know it's only been three dates, but I feel as though I've been rescued. I no longer have to worry about becoming one of those pitiful losers embittered by a failed marriage, leading a lonely pathetic life of... [off Frasier's withering look] fulfillment and good times!",
        "Frasier: Shouldn't you make a beeping noise when you back up like that?",
        "They come out into the living room.",
        "Frasier: Well, coffee will be ready in a moment.",
        "Adelle: So what were you two whispering about?",
        "The doorbell rings.",
        "Niles: Oh, nothing \u0097 just how, whenever you think you have your life figured out, something unexpected happens.",
        "He opens the door to Daphne.",
        "Daphne: Sorry, forgot my keys. Hello, all. Oh, everyone, this is Rodney Banks.",
        "In steps a man who is Niles's Doppleganger \u0097 same height, same figure, same haircut, same neat suit, same rigid posture \u0097 the sole difference is that his hair is brown.",
        "Daphne: Dr. Niles Crane.",
        "Niles: How do you do?",
        "Rodney: The pleasure is mine.",
        "They shake hands. In a perfect mirror of each other, they then take out handkerchiefs and wipe their palms. Frasier and Martin stare. Daphne, standing in the middle, doesn't seem to notice.",
        "Rodney: Flu season.",
        "Niles: Can't be too careful.",
        "Daphne: Oh, this is Dr. Frasier Crane, and his father Martin. And...",
        "Niles: This is Adelle Childs.",
        "Daphne: Hello.",
        "Adelle: Hello.",
        "Daphne: Well, we've just had the most wonderful day at the marina.",
        "Martin: Oh, you get a boat?",
        "Rodney: Actually, no. I have an inner-ear curvature that makes me prone to motion sickness. [Martin looks at Frasier, incredulous] But there's a charming bistro there that serves the most exquisite\u0097",
        "A phone rings. Mirroring each other again, Niles and Rodney take out cell phones and flip them open.",
        "Niles: Not me.",
        "Rodney: Not me.",
        "It's the cordless phone. Martin picks it up.",
        "Martin: Hello? Oh, I can't talk right now, Duke. I'm in the Twilight Zone. [hangs up]",
        "Frasier: Would, uh, you like a coffee?",
        "Daphne: Oh yes, that would be lovely.",
        "Martin: I'll give you a hand, Frasier!",
        "Martin gets up and follows Frasier into the kitchen. As soon as they make it in:",
        "Frasier/Martin: What the hell was that?!",
        "Frasier: I think maybe we should put a little red mark on the real Niles so we can tell them apart!",
        "Martin: Niles must be going nuts!",
        "Niles comes in.",
        "Niles: Can I lend you a hand?",
        "Martin: Oh no, that's fine, Niles. [Niles turns to go] Oh, wait, wait a minute! So, uh... what do you think of Rodney?",
        "Niles: Well, so far I'm not impressed. Bit of a pretentious fop, wouldn't you say?",
        "Martin: He doesn't, uh, remind you of anyone?",
        "Niles: Remind me of anyone...",
        "Rodney comes in.",
        "Rodney: So sorry, but about my coffee? I neglected to mention that I like my milk steamed, with just a dollop of foam, such as might give the impression of a cumulus cloud reflected in a still pond.",
        "Niles: Consider it done.",
        "Rodney smiles and leaves.",
        "Niles: I want to kill myself! Frasier and Martin laugh.",
        "Martin: Come on, Niles, it's funny!",
        "Niles: No! It's not remotely funny! Frasier talked me out of approaching Daphne on the same night she fell for that man!",
        "Frasier: You can't possibly be mad at me!",
        "Niles: No, no, Frasier, I'm grateful. [grabs a kitchen knife] Come here, let me show you how grateful I am!",
        "Martin: [getting in his way] Niles, calm down!",
        "Daphne comes in to get the sugar bowl and cream pitcher.",
        "Daphne: Isn't Rodney just great? [everyone agrees] You know, I think it was the moment I broke up with Joe that I heard a voice saying, \"Daphne, it's time you went for a completely new type of man.\"",
        "Daphne leaves. Niles grabs a spatula.",
        "Niles: You're a dead man! Martin gets in his way again.",
        "Frasier: Let's serve our guests their coffee! Frasier and Martin carry cups of coffee out to the living room.",
        "Frasier: Here we are, coffee. Milk's on its way, Niles is still steaming.",
        "Rodney: Nothing smells quite so heavenly as a freshly brewed cup of coffee. Well, perhaps one thing does.",
        "He smells Daphne's hair.",
        "Daphne: Oh, stop that! [laughing] He just loves to smell my hair!",
        "There's a crash from the kitchen. Frasier winces. Martin thinks, \"Uh-Oh.\"",
        "Frasier: [stricken] Anne Boleyn?",
        "Niles: [o.s.] Catherine of Aragon.",

        "Frasier: Oh, for heaven's sake, Niles. You don't take my calls, you ignore me. For God's sake, it's the behavior of a pouting adolescent. [sits down] Are you quite finished now? [realizes] You put gum on my chair, didn't you?",
        "Niles: Yep.",
        "Frasier: [removing the gum] Niles, listen: I am terribly sorry if I steered you wrong. But just think about it. You do have a wonderful new woman in your life now, don't you?",
        "Niles: Yes, I\u0097I suppose I do.",
        "Frasier: And Adelle does make you very happy, doesn't she?",
        "Niles: [perking up] Yes. [chuckles] Yes, she does.",
        "Frasier: Well, then, if you've ever taken any of my advice before,",
        "take this: Adelle may very well be the path to your happiness.",
        "No sooner are the words out of his mouth than Adelle comes into the caf\u03b9, on the arm of Rodney. They sit in a corner booth together. Niles doesn't see them.",
        "Frasier: But let's say I'm wrong...",
        "Niles: But-but you're not wrong. Adelle is a wonderful, affectionate woman.",
        "Frasier chuckles nervously.",
        "Niles: She's clearly drawn to a man of my type.",
        "Frasier: Mmm.",
        "Niles: Just thinking about her lifts my spirits. Frasier... thank you.",
        "Frasier: Niles, uh... [sighs] look.",
        "Niles turns and looks. He turns back to Frasier with outrage.",
        "Niles: I don't believe it! The betrayal! No one treats Daphne like that!",
        "He rises angrily to his feet. Frasier restrains him.",
        "Frasier: Niles! Whatever you do, do not engage him in a physical fight. The whole thing would just look too weird!",

        "Niles: What about the man after that?",
        "Daphne: Men can be such an unfeeling lot. Look at Rodney \u0097 the moment he heard I'd just broken up with someone, he moved right in for the kill. Is that how all men are?",

        "Niles: Even if he'd worshipped you from the day he laid eyes on you?",
        "Daphne: And don't think that's not just how they put it, too! [laughs] No, I think I need to do a bit of separating myself \u0097 from Joe, I mean. Yes, I'll wait a good long time before I do anymore dating.",
        "Niles: Well, I'm glad to hear that.",
        "Daphne: [chuckling] You know, it's funny when you think about it \u0097 the two of us coming to this same singles bar this week? Why, this was the very stool I was on when I met Rodney.",
        "Niles: I was sitting here when I met Adelle. [she chuckles again] What?",
        "Daphne: Oh, I was just thinking. If it'd been a different time in both our lives, we might actually have met. How do you suppose that would have gone?",
        "Niles: What, our conversation?",
        "Daphne: Yeah, come on! Just for fun \u0097 we could both use a smile.",
        "Niles: Well, uh... first I would have said, \"Is this seat taken?\" And you would have said, \"no.\" You would have said, \"my name is Daphne,\" and I would have said \"my name is Niles.\" And then I would have said... \"What are you doing for the rest of your life?\"",
