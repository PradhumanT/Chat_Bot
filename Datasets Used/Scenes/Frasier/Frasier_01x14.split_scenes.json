        "Scene A: KACL Radio Station. Bulldog is in the middle of his show. Frasier is watching from the corridor.",
        "Bulldog: [on-air] ...4 for 17 on Sunday, he calls himself a quarterback? I've passed kidney stones with more accuracy!",
        "Frasier: [to Roz, who's just passing by] Roz, Roz. Listen, could you go in there and get my briefcase for me? I was just on my way out but I left it in the studio.",
        "Roz: Why don't you go get it?",
        "Frasier: Well, because every time I go in there, he puts me on the air and humiliates me.",
        "Roz: Well, what do you think he does to me? Last week when I went in to get my car keys he introduced me as Martina Navratilova's girlfriend. [leaves]",
        "Bulldog: [ringing a cowbell] Well Chuck, I'm really sorry I offended you. Now why don't you put your skirt back on and do some dishes?",
        "Frasier opens the door and crawls into the studio. His briefcase is sitting on the console near the door. As he reaches out for it, Bulldog, who has seen him, picks up the briefcase and moves it to the other side. Frasier, keeping his head down, reaches a hand over the console and gropes blindly for it.",
        "Bulldog: The lines are open. And how about some real men calling instead of crybabies like Chuck?",
        "He raps Frasier over the knuckles with his drumstick, making him jump to his feet.",
        "Bulldog: Well... look who's just crawled into the doghouse, it's Dr. Frasier Crane! And you know what we always do when we get a house call from the doctor. [puts tape in machine]",
        "Tape: [Italian] Dropp-a your pants and bend over, I take-a your temperature.",
        "Frasier: Hello, Bulldog.",
        "Bulldog: [holding up briefcase] So, doc? Who's your pick for the Giants- Saints game this weekend?",
        "Frasier: [wearily] The Giants.",
        "Bulldog: You're kidding!",
        "Frasier: The Saints?",
        "Bulldog: You're kidding!",
        "Frasier: Somebody has to win.",
        "Bulldog: Yeah. They would if the Giants and Saints were playing this weekend!",
        "He plays a tape of a donkey braying, then throws the briefcase to Frasier.",
        "Frasier: Yes, that was very funny indeed. I wished you'd played it on my show. It deserves to be heard by a much larger audience. Hee haw! Hee haw! [leaves]",

        "Niles: Dad.",
        "Martin: Kinda early.",
        "Niles: Well, I just put Maris on the train to Chicago. And you know how desolate I am without my Maris.",
        "Daphne: [opening package] Champagne?",
        "Niles: Goes with all occasions. Can I be of any assistance in the kitchen?",
        "Daphne: No, I have everything well in hand.",
        "Niles: Ah, well... lucky everything.",
        "He goes over to the table, where Martin is working out a chess problem.",
        "Niles: [as Martin reaches for a piece] Uh-uh. [Martin reaches for another piece] Mmm-mmm.",
        "Martin: All right, what would you do?",
        "Niles: Well for starters, I'd take that corn-nut off the board.",
        "Martin: That corn-nut's my bishop. Eddie ate the real one.",
        "Niles: In that case, corn-nut to Rook 7.",
        "Frasier arrives.",
        "Frasier: Hello all.",
        "Daphne: Evening, Dr. Crane. Guess what your brother brought, champagne.",
        "Frasier: Oh, Maris left for Chicago already?",
        "Niles: She's riding the rails as we speak.",
        "Daphne: If I may ask, why does she take the train?",
        "Niles: She's been afraid to fly since her harrowing incident.",
        "Daphne: Oh, dear. Did a plane almost crash?",
        "Niles: No, no. She was bumped from first class. She still wakes up screaming.",
        "Martin: Hey Frasier, I'm glad you're here, I've got a favour to ask you.",
        "Frasier: What is it, dad?",
        "Martin: Well, you know my old buddy from the force Joe Linski's running the benefit for the Widows and Orphans fund this year, and he's doing one of those bachelor auctions and he's out looking for local celebrities and I thought if we could get somebody really famous from the radio station...",
        "Frasier: Dad, say no more. I'd be delighted to help.",
        "Martin: Great. So you'll ask Bulldog tomorrow?",
        "Frasier: ...Bulldog.",
        "Martin: Oh. Well, you know, don't get me wrong, I was going to ask you too.",
        "Frasier: Mm-hmm?",
        "Martin: Yeah I was, I was. I was just saving the best for last.",
        "Frasier: A-ha.",
        "Niles: Oh Frasier, give him a break. If he backpedals any faster, he'll trip over his walker.",
        "Frasier: All right, I'll do it.",
        "Martin: Oh, great! I really appreciate it... you won't forget to ask Bulldog, will ya?",
        "Frasier: I'll leave a note on his hydrant.",
        "Daphne: A bachelor auction. I've always thought it would be fun to pick a man off the block to do my bidding and fulfill my every desire. [then] Dr. Crane?",
        "Niles: [from his private little world] I'd love to. [realises Daphne is offering him some champagne] I mean, ah... Frasier? I was just thinking, what if no-one bids? What if you're left standing there, with flop sweat trickling down your back, amidst a great, gaping silence.",
        "Martin: It'll never happen, Niles.",
        "Frasier: Thank you, dad.",

        "Frasier: My God! The estrogen levels are off the charts out there!",
        "Bulldog: Yeah, isn't it great? I mean, deep down, chicks are just like guys. We all want the same thing.",
        "Frasier: Well, I've got news for them: Frasier Crane does not put out. All they're getting for their little donation is a well- prepared gourmet meal and a handshake at the door.",
        "Bulldog: BORING! My date gets a stretch limo, moon roof, dinner, floor seats at the Sonics game and these incredible buns of steel. [turns around] Feel 'em, doc. Come on, feel 'em!",
        "Frasier: Thank you, no!",
        "As Martin enters we hear the announcer on the stage say:-",
        "Announcer: Please, please. Keep articles of clothing off the stage!",
        "Martin: Man, you show these women a little celebrity beefcake and they go nutso.",
        "Frasier: I don't mind telling you dad, I'm a little bit nervous. This is a textbook case of mob mentality. I hope all the fire exits are clearly marked.",
        "Martin: Ah, relax, relax, will ya?",
        "Frasier: Right, that's easy for you to say. You're not the one jumping into the Rottweiler pit with a pork chop around your neck!",
        "Martin: [spotting a celebrity] Hey Frasier, that's T.J. Smith, he's a linebacker for the Seahawks. They call him \"The Enforcer,\" he's put two quarterbacks in hospital already this season. [goes over to T.J.] Hey, T.J.! Marty Crane, nice to meet ya.",

        "Bulldog: Hey, T.J. How was it, man?",
        "T.J.: It was horrible. They're like sharks at a feeding frenzy. The one who bought me had this crazed look in her eye.",
        "Roz sweeps in.",
        "Roz: Where do I pay?",
        "Frasier: Roz!",
        "Roz: I saw what I wanted and I went after it. [T.J. makes to back off] Stay!",
        "Manager: Number 20? [this is Frasier]",
        "Frasier: [nervously] That's me.",
        "Martin: You know son, I haven't had a chance to tell you how much I appreciate this. You know, having somebody like you in the auction really adds class.",
        "Frasier: My pleasure, dad.",
        "Martin: Now, if the bidding gets slow, drop a quarter and take a couple of minutes to pick it up.",

        "Frasier re-enters.",
        "Bulldog: So Doc, who bought ya?",
        "Frasier: I have no idea. Last thing I remember is someone shouting out, \"Shake your money maker.\"",

        "Frasier: So you're back awfully quick.",
        "Bulldog: Hey-hey! I was one of the last guys out there! The money was running low, but! - there was still one rawhide chew toy out there for the Bulldog.",
        "Daphne enters, in a state of shock.",
        "Bulldog: [leaves, saying to her as he slaps her behind] I gotta take a squirt. When I come back, we'll play fetch.",
        "He slaps Daphne's backside and exits.",
        "Frasier: Oh my God, Daphne. Why?",
        "Daphne: Things were slowing down, so your father asked me to shill. I opened at a hundred dollars, who knew that would be the only bid?",

        "Christina: [looking at room] You rented a restaurant trolley.",
        "Frasier: No, no, I own it. Don't tell me that you don't have one?",
        "Christina: There's just one more thing. Um, my friend Sandy got called in on the same job, and she was supposed to look after my daughter.",
        "She indicates the corridor. Frasier looks out to find a young girl standing there.",
        "Frasier: Don't tell me you want me to babysit?",
        "Christina: Look, I wouldn't do this, but I'm really in a jam. Look, Sandy'll take her as soon as we get back, and umm, that'll leave just the two of us.",
        "Frasier: Christina, I'm not really sure if I can...",
        "He catches onto her look.",

        "She exits.",
        "Frasier: Well... come on in, have a seat. Can I get you, um, a soft drink? Goose liver pate? Renata, that's a pretty name. I suppose it has some poetic, romantic significance...",
        "Renata: Can I use your phone?",
        "Frasier: Now, Renata. We're going to be spending the evening together, let's try to make the best of it, shall we? I may surprise you, you know. I'm probably more \"with it\" than you think I am... the phone's right there.",

        "Frasier: Well, I'm not exactly thrilled about it either, but your mother was in a bind. And for the record, I am not a perv.",
        "Renata: You don't get it. She is always doing stuff like this. She's a flake.",
        "Frasier: Nonetheless, flake or not, you are in my charge. I think it's Time you had something that was a bit more nutritious. Now, how about some seafood crepes? Lobster Neuberg? [gives up] Corn dog dipped in curare?",

        "Renata: Well, duh.",
        "Frasier: You know, I have a son. I'd hate to think by the time he's your age, he thinks of me as some sort of, um...",

        "Frasier: Thank you.",
        "Renata: Brace yourself.",

        "He cuts the packet in half and gives one to Renata.",
        "Frasier: Put that in your pipe and smoke it. Reset to the Living Room, as they come back in.",

        "Renata: You mean you want me to tell you all my problems like those Gomers on your show? Like you care.",
        "Frasier: I do care about the Gomers. I even care about you.",
        "Renata: Don't make me hurl! [Frasier gives up and sits down] She keeps telling people I'm younger than I am.",
        "Frasier: Why do you think she does that?",
        "Renata: So they won't know how old she is. I've been nine for the past three years.",
        "Frasier: Really?",
        "Renata: That's nothing. Once, she promised to take me ice-skating for my birthday? On the way there she saw a tattoo parlor. So she just left me out on the sidewalk 'til she could get a stupid butterfly tattooed on her shoulder. It's like she forgot I was even out there.",
        "Frasier: My God! How old were you?",
        "Renata: That was the first time I was nine.",

        "Daphne: I must confess, I was a little apprehensive about going out with you tonight. But I'm actually having a jolly time. Unless of course it's the champagne getting to me. I have had quite a bit, haven't I? Oh, who cares? That's the beauty of being in a limo. Unless of course the driver's drinking. [into intercom] You're not drinking, are you? [to Bulldog] He's not drinking. Let's drink to the driver not drinking.",
        "Bulldog: Man, you're really looped, this is great.",
        "Outside, someone leans on their horn.",
        "Daphne: Well, that's annoying, isn't it? Certainly is taking a long time getting out of this parking lot. Did I mention this was my first basketball game? Yes, of course I did, three or four times. I still can't get over those players. They are positively gigantic. Not that being tall is the only measure of a man... but it's a bloody good one. [bursts out laughing] Oh dear, I just insulted you, didn't I? Sorry. Oh well, you can take it, you're a tough little nut.",
        "Even Bulldog cannot help but be turned off by her drunkenness.",
        "Daphne: Oh, dear. This is not good. Not good at all.",
        "Bulldog: What, you don't like the champagne?",
        "Daphne: No, I can see the bottom of me glass.",
        "Bulldog: [refilling Daphne's glass] Well, bottoms up!",
        "Daphne: Oh, you are a naughty boy. Now don't go getting any ideas. Oh, look who I'm saying this to. You don't have an idea in your head! [laughs] Did it again. I insulted you. Let's drink to that. Boom!",
        "She knocks her glass on Bulldog's forehead. Outside, the car horns start up again.",
        "Daphne: Now that is downright rude. [lowers window and yells through a speaker-cone] Hey, you there! You in the Firebird! Yes, you! Stop that honking! Now, now, just because you look stupid doesn't mean you have to act stupid!",
        "Bulldog: Hey! Don't aggravate him, we're kinda pinned in here.",
        "Daphne: Oh, posh! Civilization's not going to progress one iota unless someone points out when people's manners are remiss. [from outside we hear someone shouting, \"Move it!\"] OH, SHUT",
        "YOUR BLOODY CAKEHOLE!",
        "Bulldog: Don't do that! [looks out] Great, now he's getting out of his car!",
        "Daphne: Ooh, he's a tall one too.",
        "Bulldog: Quick, roll up your window, lock the door.",
        "Daphne: Don't be stupid, he's not going to hurt a woman.",

        "Bulldog: SHUT UP!!!",
        "He gets pulled out of the car while Daphne waves her fists, shadow- boxing. As his door slams, the limo starts to roll.",
        "Daphne: Oh. Well, we're moving. [through the speaker-cone, to Bulldog outside] Thank you, Pitbull! I had a lovely time!",
        "She falls over while attempting to finish the champagne.",

        "Scene C: Frasier's Apartment. He and Renata are sitting at the dinner table, eating the cookie dough.",
        "Frasier: You know, this cookie dough is not that bad. Of course, I'm Sure later I'll be hurling. [the doorbell bing bongs] Ah, that must be Her Fabulousness. Want to take the rest home with you?",
        "Renata: I'd better not. If I gain an ounce, she goes ballistic. She makes me weigh in every morning.",
        "Frasier: You poor thing!",
        "Renata: I'm used to it.",
        "Frasier opens the door to Christina.",
        "Christina: Hi, I'm back. [kisses Frasier] Renata, honey. [kisses her] Sandy's waiting downstairs in the car.",
        "Frasier: Renata, I must say I had a rather enjoyable evening.",
        "Renata: You don't get out much, do you? [leaves]",
        "Frasier: You know, I think she likes me.",
        "Christina: Well uh, thank you for helping me out. Now, roll out that trolley, I'm starving.",
        "Frasier: You know, Christina, I don't think so. I think you ought to go home and spend the evening with your daughter.",
        "Christina: But I thought we had a date?",
        "Frasier: Well, you know, when we first met, I was, well, attracted by your remarkable beauty. But now that I know a bit more about you, well suddenly you don't look so good, sister.",
        "Christina: Excuse me?",
        "Frasier: A daughter is a privilege, not an inconvenience. You don't Leave her standing on some street corner while you're inside getting tattooed! Or keep her in some ageless Never-never Land where everyone is nine for ever and ever!",
        "Christina: Renata told you I did that.",
        "Frasier: Yes! She also told me about the morning weigh-in's. And the time you left her with the coat-check girl at the Palladium, so you could go dancing! I mean, what kind of excuse for a mother are you, anyway?",
        "Christina: Well. Did it ever occur to you that she might be lying? 'Cause this is the first night I've been out in over a year. God knows John and Maryanne never take her.",
        "Frasier: Who are they?",
        "Christina: Her father and his new wife.",
        "Frasier: Oh, who are Tony and Whitesnake?",
