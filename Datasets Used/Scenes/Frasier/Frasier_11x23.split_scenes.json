    "Recap": [
        "While on a plane, Frasier meets a woman named Anne. They engage in conversation and in flashback, Frasier recalls the events preceding his plane ride: Frasier and Niles volunteer to put together a quick wedding for Martin and Ronee when the venue is only available for one day. Meanwhile, Frasier says farewell to Charlotte as she departs for Chicago. The wedding ceremony gets off to a rocky start when the guests are stranded outside in the heat and things get worse when Eddie swallows one of the rings. Daphne and Niles rush him to a nearby veterinarian and while there, Daphne goes into labor and gives birth to her and Niles' first son, whom they name David. Ronee and Martin get married at the vet clinic. Frasier's agent Bebe Glazer gets him an offer to do a television show in San Francisco, which Frasier initially declines but after realizing that he wants to start a new chapter in his life, he accepts. A case of communication breakdowns lead Martin, Ronee, Roz, Daphne and Niles to believe that Frasier is dying, an error given more substantial backing when he begins giving them each some of his most prized possessions, and when a doctor phones and leaves a message saying that Frasier's 'results weren't good.' The misunderstanding is soon cleared up and the family celebrates Frasier's new opportunity in San Francisco. Before he leaves, Frasier and his family share a tearful farewell and Frasier explains to them that with Martin and Ronee newly-weds and Daphne and Niles' newborn, David, and Roz getting the job of station manager at KACL they each have begun a new chapter in their lives and that he wants that for himself now. He then goes on to recite Tennyson's \"Ulysses\" which flows into him saying it in his last show. Frasier records his last show, with the people who work at KACL and his family watching him, his final words on his talk show are \"For eleven years, you have heard me say 'I'm listening'; well you were listening too, and for that I'm eternally grateful...Goodnight Seattle\", and hangs up his headphones before the episode flashes back to the plane, where Frasier has just finished relaying his story to Anne. In a final twist, the plane touches down not in San Francisco, but in Chicago. Frasier turns to Anne and says \"Wish me luck...\", then the episode (and the series) ends, in a perpetual cliffhanger. Episode Note: Niles and Daphne's son was named David in David Angell's honor."

        "Skyline: A rainbow arcs out of the building line and touches the first letter of the title.",
        "ACT ONE",
        "Scene One - An Airplane Cabin A rather pensive Frasier Crane is sitting on a plane, looking out of the window. It would seem the plane is going through some turbulence - a jolt of which is especially felt by Anne, the young lady in black sitting next to him.",
        "Frasier: [calmly] You all right?",
        "Anne takes a deep sigh and turns to him, still pressing herself into the seat.",
        "Anne: [embarrassed smile] I hate flying.",
        "Frasier: Just a little turbulence, we'll be through it in a minute.",
        "Another jolt makes Frasier doubt his words.",
        "Frasier: Mother of God!",
        "Anne: This is so embarrassing. I mean, I treat people for this. I'm a psychiatrist.",
        "Frasier: Well, there's a small world, I'm a psychiatrist too. [putting out his hand:] Dr. Frasier Crane.",
        "Anne: Ooh, I've heard your show. [returning the handshake:] Dr. Anne Ranberg.",
        "[N.B. Anne Ranberg is a blend of the names of two previous Frasier writers; Anne Flett-Giordano and Chuck Ranberg.]",
        "Frasier: Lovely to meet you.",
        "Anne: Nice to meet you. Now, don't let me interrupt you. You seemed kinda deep in thought.",
        "Frasier: Oh, I suppose I was. It's been a rather eventful three weeks for me.",
        "Anne: Well, if you want to talk about it, it might get our minds off the flight.",
        "Frasier: It's really rather personal... It's nothing you'd be interested in.",
        "Anne: [accepting] Okay, then.",
        "They sit back comfortably into silence but after another jolt of turbulence...",
        "Frasier: So I was dating this woman...",
        "Anne: Mmm-hmm...",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Scene Two - Frasier's Bedroom The scene takes us back with Frasier's story. Frasier and Charlotte are wrapped in each other's arms in his bed. They look perfectly serene.",
        "Charlotte: [drowsily] Weren't we on our way to lunch?",
        "Frasier: Yes, but then you followed me in here when I came to get my briefcase and uttered the fatal phrase that no man can resist.",
        "Charlotte: [laughing] I said I liked your pillow shams.",
        "Frasier: Nice try, my little temptress, but I'm down for at least an hour.",
        "Charlotte: [laughs and caresses his face] Do you still have time for lunch before work?",
        "Frasier: Well, my show doesn't start till two, and it's only...",
        "Frasier looks at the clock to see how many more Frasier hours Charlotte will be able to clock up.",
        "Frasier: [jumps up in bed] Oh dear God! It is two o'clock.",
        "SMASH CUT TO: Radio Station Roz is stressing on the phone as an even more anxious Kenny bursts in.",
        "Kenny: Where the hell is he?",
        "Roz: I don't know. [hanging up] I called his cell, I called his house... You're going to have to go on for him.",
        "Kenny: Me?!",
        "Roz: Yeah, you - well, I'm not. Last time I did it, it was a total disaster!",
        "[N.B. An obvious reference to [10.2] \"Enemy at the Gate,\" when an overconfident Roz took over Frasier's show, and ended up letting slip over the air that she and Frasier had slept together.]",
        "Roz: Aren't you always saying you used to be a DJ?",
        "Kenny: Oh, twenty years ago, I can't do that anymore!",
        "Roz: Well, it better come back to you, you've got five seconds.",
        "Roz pushes him into the presenter's booth.",
        "Kenny: I can't! I'm a nervous wreck! My palms are sweaty, my mouth is like cotton...",
        "Roz directs him to the microphone and instantly Kenny becomes a hideous D.J. monster with a voice sounding like the voice-over narrator on movie trailers after a bad dose of helium.",
        "Kenny: Hey, Emerald City, Kenny Daly heerrre! Master of the Mike, Baron of the Booth, the Man of the Hour, too sweet to be sourrrr! [puts on headphones] The doctor's ouuuut today, but Kenny's heerrre - filling the seat, takin' the heat! I might even throw in a call or two to Grandma Gert. [typical old lady's voice:] But no kids, I hate kids! [back to the voice of D.J. Daly Hell] Whoo-hoo, she's in a mood today!",
        "Kenny looks up at an unbelieving Roz. However, he fails to translate the signals being made by her boggling eyes, and just grins.",
        "CUT TO: Frasier's Bedroom Meanwhile, back in the bedroom... Charlotte is listening to Kenny's ramblings as Frasier dresses in the bathroom.",
        "Kenny: [v.o. from the radio:] Who's this coming into the booth? Why, it's Percy Von Snootenheim!",
        "Frasier: [o.s. from the bathroom] Turn that off!",
        "Charlotte complies as Frasier comes out of the bathroom dressed for work.",
        "Frasier: I'm sorry I have to rush off. I wish we could spend the whole day together. [leans in to kiss Charlotte]",
        "Charlotte: I don't leave for Chicago until midnight. I'll, I'll come over and make you dinner.",
        "Frasier: Oh that sounds great, I'd love that.",
        "They touch hands and then part.",
        "Charlotte: Any requests?",
        "Frasier: Uh... I liked what I had for lunch.",
        "Charlotte: [blushing] Why don't I just surprise you?",
        "Frasier: Still sounding like lunch.",
        "He laughs and leans in to kiss her again.",
        "CUT TO: Radio Station Back in the studio, Roz's mind begins to shut down as she listens to Kenny embarrass himself further. He is sat with his feet on the console, and the microphone in his hands.",
        "Kenny: Isn't that a great song, people? Really brings back the memories. Sorry I kinda forgot the words there in the middle. So let's toss it to the news! [clicks a button with vigor]",
        "Frasier sneakily enters from the producer's door.",
        "Roz: Where the hell have you been?",
        "Frasier: I'm sorry, I am sorry. I had a doctor's appointment, it couldn't be helped!",
        "Frasier enters the presenter's booth and relieves Kenny of his duties.",
        "Kenny: Just in time, Doc. This turned out to be one of your better shows.",
        "Frasier: Well thank you, Kenny.",
        "Frasier sits in worry to find his angst rising when an old friend suddenly appears in the booth. Behold, the return of Special Agent Bebe Glazer - licensed to make you a star!",
        "Bebe: Darling!",
        "Frasier: Bebe?! What are you doing here?",
        "Bebe: [flinging her arms around him] I just came by to see my favorite client, [kisses him on the cheek, then turns to Kenny] and the wonderful man who's giving him such a happy, happy home.",
        "Kenny: Ah, you're the best, Bebe!",
        "Bebe smiles as she shuts the door on him, and then in a heartbeat turns to Frasier and says:",
        "Bebe: Good news, I'm busting you out of this hellhole!",
        "Frasier: What?!",
        "Bebe: Did you ever hear of Dr. Mark Reisman?",
        "[N.B. Mark Reisman is a reference to a man of the same name who previously worked on \"Frasier\" as a producer.]",
        "Frasier: The San Francisco radio psychiatrist? Yes, we had a nice encounter once at a conference.",
        "Bebe: Well, last week he had a not-so-nice encounter with a falling air conditioner.",
        "She sticks her tongue out and gestures to her throat as if to slit it.",
        "Bebe: Anyway, they want you to replace him and the money's huge!",
        "Frasier: Poor Mark... what a ghastly way to die!",
        "Bebe: Yes, I cried so hard it was all I could do to stuff your demo tape in the Fed-Ex pouch. But they want you!",
        "Frasier: Well, it's very tempting, Bebe, but I'm very happy here in Seattle. I don't want to leave.",
        "Bebe: Darling, it's San Francisco! Do you know what life is like there for a good-looking straight man? You'll be like a Snickers bar at a fat camp!",
        "She knows just what to say to tempt him mightily. He considers it for a moment, then...",
        "Frasier: [resisting the Bebe temptation] Uhhh... No. My answer is still no, Bebe. I've got to begin my show. [sits down]",
        "Bebe heads to the door and to the next stage of her plea.",
        "Bebe: Well, that's gratitude for ya! Do you have any idea the lengths I went to to make this happen? [opens the door]",
        "Frasier: Wait a minute. You were in San Francisco last week. Don't tell me...!",
        "Bebe: I was nowhere near that air conditioner. [teasing:] You're worse than the police.",
        "Bebe giggles like the Devil and leaves Dr. Faust-ier without his soul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "THE GULFS MAY WASH",
        "US DOWN",
        "Scene Three - Frasier's Apartment - Kitchen We are presented with a visual image of Charlotte's opening line: her cooking at the stove, Frasier behind her with his arm wrapped around her waist, nuzzling her affectionately.",
        "Charlotte: We are such a clich\u00e9! Little woman at the stove, big rugged man with his brawny arm...",
        "Frasier: Oh, the hollandaise is breaking!",
        "As she turns her attention to the imperilled sauce, Frasier removes his brawny arm and enters the living room, carrying a bottle of wine.",
        "Reset to: Living Room The table is set for two. Martin, dressed in his suit, enters from his bedroom.",
        "Frasier: Dad, I thought you were going out with Niles and Daphne?",
        "Martin: I'm waiting on Ronee.",
        "Frasier: Yes, well, Charlotte is leaving for Chicago in three hours. This is our farewell dinner.",
        "Charlotte enters, carrying two plates.",
        "Charlotte: Oh, hi Martin.",
        "Martin: Oh, hi, how are ya? Don't worry, we're leaving. I'm not going to spoil your romantic mood. [shouts down the hallway:] Hey, Ronee, what, did you fall in?!",
        "The doorbell sounds.",
        "Frasier: Good heavens, I thought that you were meeting them downstairs.",
        "Martin: [heading to the door] That's what I thought too.",
        "Martin opens the door to find a befuddled Kenny Daly.",
        "Kenny: Hey, Martin. Oh, thank God you're home, Doc. I'm going a little crazy, I need some advice.",
        "Frasier: [trying to excuse him] Kenny, we just put dinner on the table.",
        "Kenny: Oh thanks but I'm too worked up to eat. Doing your show today, I... I got the fever! I want to get back behind the mike. But should I quit my job, throw away my whole career and financial security just to chase some cock-a-mamie dream?!",
        "Frasier: [with a big smile] Yes! Off you go!",
        "Kenny: You didn't even have to think about it! You always believed in me, Doc!",
        "Kenny throws his arms around Frasier in a zealous hug. He suddenly spots Charlotte and, whilst still hugging Frasier, holds out his hand.",
        "Kenny: Hi. Kenny Daly.",
        "Charlotte: [shakes hand] Hi, nice to meet you.",
        "Frasier: This is Charlotte.",
        "Kenny: [welling up] I'm getting all messy here. Let me just pop into the powder room real fast.",
        "Kenny leaves to the powder room as Martin shouts back down the hallway.",
        "Martin: Ronee! While we're young!",
        "Ronee: [enters] Too late! [to Frasier] Well, have a great evening, you two.",
        "Frasier: Yes, thank you. Bye.",
        "Ronee: Oh damn it, my contact slipped, hang on.",
        "Ronee opens the powder room door.",
        "Kenny: [o.s. from the bathroom] Whoa!",
        "Ronee: Whoa yourself. [closes door] Do we know him?",
        "The front door opens revealing the terrible twosome... nearly threesome.",
        "Niles: Knock-knock.",
        "Frasier: Oh, for God's sake!",
        "Niles: Now, I know it's your special night but my very pregnant wife insisted we come up.",
        "Daphne: [holding up her hands, pushing her legs together] Oh sorry, won't be a minute.",
        "Daphne goes for the powder room door.",
        "Kenny: [o.s. from the bathroom] Whoa!",
        "Daphne: [closes the door] Oh, sorry! I'll just run down the hall.",
        "Charlotte: Maybe I'll start over on that dinner.",
        "Daphne leaves as Charlotte excuses herself to the kitchen. Martin, Niles, and Ronee, to Frasier's great frustration, sit down to wait for Daphne.",
        "Niles: I'm sorry for intruding, but nowadays Daphne can't go ten minutes... we're late for everything.",
        "Frasier: Yes, well, you know how Chez Henri hates it when people are Late, so I tell you what, why don't we call for that elevator right now...",
        "He energetically goes to the door, urging everyone to follow him.",
        "Frasier: And tell Henri that the first round of drinks is on me!",
        "Frasier opens the door to find another surprise. A drunken surprise. Of English heritage.",
        "Simon: Whiskey, please!",
        "Frasier: Simon?!",
        "Simon: Oh Frasier, how are ya? [greets Frasier with a hug]",
        "Frasier: Please leave immediately.",
        "Simon bellows a laugh as Daphne returns.",
        "Simon: Hey! Oh, there's my little sister. You're not so little any more now, are you? [he advances to her pregnant bump]",
        "Daphne: [stands back from the drunk smell] Simon, what are you doing here?",
        "Simon: Well I heard you was knocked up so I, er, brought you a present. Come on in, lads!",
        "Richard E. Grant and Robbie Coltrane enter... um, sorry, I mean Daphne's brothers, Michael and Stephen Moon, enter from the hallway. Daphne greets them with excitement. Frasier and Niles greet them with immediate concern.",
        "Michael: Hello, sis!",
        "Daphne: Oh my God, Michael! [hugs him] And Stephen! [hugs him]",
        "Simon: We knew you'd be here when we went to your house and you wasn't there.",
        "Stephen: So we took the liberty of leaving our things in your guest room.",
        "Niles: How did you get in?",
        "Michael: [mumbled, pointing at Niles] How did we...",
        "They burst out into a fit of boisterous laughter.",
        "It should be noted that all of Michael's speech is mumbled, which combined with his thick accent makes his speech very hard to understand. Think of the character of Joseph in \"Wuthering Heights\" and move west over the Pennines.",
        "I must say, Coltrane's attempt at the Mancunian accent is easily the best seen so far on the show. Interestingly, he is also a Scot in reality, just like Brian Cox, who played Daphne's father, Harry. --Nick Hartley",
        "[N.B. Think also of Brad Pitt's character in Guy Ritchie's \"Snatch.\" However, I notice that Nick is uniquely qualified to make some sense of it. The American transcribers doing the closed captioning for the episode simply wrote, \"unintelligible gibberish.\" --Mike Lee]",
        "Daphne: Stephen and Michael, this is my husband, Niles. [hand shakes occur] Oh and his brother, Frasier. And this is Martin and his fianc\u00e9e Ronee. And, er, [looking over at the previous occupant of the bathroom] sorry, your name again?",
        "Kenny: Kenny.",
        "Daphne: Kenny.",
        "Michael: So, lads, I tell you what... [mumbling] You've a lovely 'ouse. [motioning around the room] It's come rhand thee're, rhand thee're... [mumbling unintelligibly] he's done bloody well for himself.",
        "Simon: That's right, Michael. Frasier does very well for himself. Tell you what, let's take the tour.",
        "Frasier: [hands up] There will be no tours!",
        "Martin: Listen, uh, why don't you guys join us for dinner?",
        "Stephen: Good, I'll lay the table. [picks up cutlery] Is this real silver? [attempts to bend it]",
        "Frasier: Give me that! [takes it off of him]",
        "Michael, meanwhile, is man-handling Frasier's Chihuly glass sculpture.",
        "Michael: Oh, wow, see, platey, platey, platey... [mumbling unintelligibly] It's a bloody great ash tray.",
        "Frasier: [shrieks in terror] Put that down!",
        "He rushes over and takes it from him in disgust.",
        "[N.B. Since the Chihuly is genuine and valued at upwards of $75,000, what Robbie Coltrane and Kelsey Grammer are juggling may well be a replica.]",
        "CUT TO: Kitchen Meanwhile, in the kitchen, Charlotte is back cooking at the stove, smiling happily - unaware that Simon is the man fondling her from behind.",
        "Charlotte: [teasing:] You know, we could have some real fun if you got rid of some of those people.",
        "Simon: Oh, just give us a minute then, love...",
        "Charlotte screams and runs into the lounge. Simon follows.",
        "Reset to: Living Room Frasier runs over to catch Charlotte coming out.",
        "Charlotte: Who is that creep?",
        "Simon: You know, I'm getting some very mixed signals.",
        "Frasier: All right, that's it! I want you all out of here! [pushing Simon] And I do not mean a leisurely exit, I mean a break-neck, trampling-each-other, this-theatre's-on-fire stampede!",
        "They all leave but Simon holds up for a second.",
        "Simon: Yeah, all right, okay, I can take a hint, Frasier! Right. Look, that's a lovely woman that you've got for yourself. Congratulations.",
        "He hugs Frasier.",
        "Frasier: Yes, thank you.",
        "Simon: Yeah, yeah. [looks over Frasier's shoulder at Charlotte and gestures to her] Give us a call, I'll be at Daphne's...",
        "Frasier: Oh, get out of here!",
        "Frasier pushes him out and finally slams the door on them for the peace with Charlotte he desired.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Scene Four - Apartment, three hours later. Frasier and Charlotte are finishing up their final game of Scrabble.",
        "Frasier: Because it's not a word.",
        "Charlotte: Yes, it is.",
        "Frasier: No, it's not.",
        "Charlotte: Yes, it is.",
        "Frasier: Use it in a sentence.",
        "Charlotte: \"Her grandmother's bed was warm and... quilty.\"",
        "Frasier: [looking at another of her words] And why is she lying there? Because she's feeling all \"befevered\" again?",
        "Charlotte: [smiling sweetly] Could I borrow your \"F\"? I've got a little message for you.",
        "He chuckles. Charlotte's mobile rings. She answers.",
        "Charlotte: Hello. Okay, thanks. [hangs up] My car's here. Frasier murmurs in understanding.",
        "[N.B. In Laura Linney's recent film, \"Love Actually\" the trademark of her character was a stubborn refusal to turn her mobile off, no matter how many times it rang at just the right moment to kill romance.]",
        "Frasier: I still don't know why you won't let me drive you to the airport.",
        "Charlotte: No, I can't stand all that airport goodbye stuff. This is better. [goes to gather her belongings]",
        "Frasier: Right. Uh, well then...",
        "Frasier and Charlotte walk towards each other.",
        "Charlotte: Let's not...",
        "Frasier: ...right.",
        "Charlotte: [tearing up] Because if you start...",
        "Frasier: Yeah. Me too. Okay. Well then, uh, good luck in Chicago.",
        "Charlotte and Frasier look into each other's eyes. Frasier is in the middle of yet another goodbye. They hug dearly.",
        "Charlotte: Thanks.",
        "Frasier: Got your ticket?",
        "Charlotte: [looks in bag] Uh, yeah.",
        "Frasier: Great, great. Oh, oh, [darts to set of drawers next to toilet] listen, I have a little something here for you.",
        "Charlotte: Damn it. I knew you were going to do something sweet like that. I didn't get you anything.",
        "Frasier: It's just a hair band I found in the shower drain.",
        "He presents the lost band to her.",
        "Charlotte: Thanks.",
        "Frasier: Yeah. [chuckles] Uh, let me get your coat. [he does]",
        "Charlotte: This wasn't supposed to be so hard.",
        "Frasier: [helping her on with her coat] I don't know about you, but I've had enough easy goodbyes. I'm kinda glad to have the chance to have another tough one.",
        "Charlotte: [putting her hand in his] Thank you for a great three weeks.",
        "They kiss goodbye.",
        "Frasier: Bye, Charlotte.",
        "Charlotte: Bye, Frasier.",
        "She leaves. Frasier looks back at his empty apartment and begins to slowly walk back to the sofa. He is stopped by a knock on the door. He opens it to find Charlotte back again.",
        "Charlotte: Forgot my scarf!",
        "Frasier: Oh. Oh, my fault.",
        "He tenderly winds it around her neck.",
        "Frasier: Right. They tentatively kiss once more goodbye.",
        "Frasier: Bye.",
        "Charlotte: Yeah.",
        "She leaves. Frasier looks back again at his once more empty apartment and begins to slowly walk back to the sofa only to find another, albeit similar, interruption. He opens the door again...",
        "Charlotte: Cell phone.",
        "Frasier: Oh. Yes. Yes. Oh, here.",
        "Frasier goes round the room to take the cell phone off of the table. Charlotte chooses a different route. They make a move at the same times and bang their heads together.",
        "Both: Ow!",
        "Frasier: Sorry.",
        "Charlotte: No, it's my fault.",
        "Frasier: My word. Ah....",
        "They look back at each other, clutching their heads.",
        "Charlotte: See ya.",
        "Frasier: See ya.",
        "She leaves. Frasier looks back and... you know the drill.",
        "Frasier: Oh for God's sake, what now?",
        "He opens the door and finds Charlotte open-armed. They hug passionately.",
        "Charlotte: We couldn't say goodbye on a head butt. They kiss passionately.",
        "Charlotte: Feel better?",

        "Frasier: What's this?",
        "Niles: This is called \"The Born Musician.\" You put this speaker on the mother's stomach, and it bombards the baby with classical music, thus instilling a taste for higher culture.",

        "Martin: Oh, but we had our hearts set on the Branford Inn. It's where we had our second date.",
        "Ronee: Yeah, we had a little too much wine, and the couple at the next table said \"get a room,\" and so we did. Oh, well, guess we better start thinking about Plan B.",
        "She exits.",
        "Martin: Oh, damn. Well, I just feel sorry for Ronee. You know, her first wedding was kind of bare-boned, and that's why she had her heart set on something special. You know, a fancy menu, swing band, flowers everywhere. You need that once in your life.",

        "Martin: But that's, that's eight days away! You have to get a caterer, a justice of the peace...",

        "Frasier: Television... well, that certainly sounds tempting, but, but my home is here! There are more important things than money!",
        "Bebe: Yes, I know. There's power. But money can buy that.",

        "Frasier: What? [runs out beside her] Oh, good lord! That's my cannon operator! At the end of the ceremony, he's supposed to fire that antique cannon. I'm not sure there's anybody else who knows how to work the damn thing. Oh...",

        "Michael: [looks up] Cannon?",
        "Frasier and Niles look at him, surprised.",
        "Stephen: If it's a cannon you need fired, Michael's your man.",

        "Frasier: Roz, her cue to lead the procession out at the end of the ceremony is when I say, \"ladies and gentlemen, Mr. and Mrs. Martin Crane!\"",
        "BOOM! Screams come from the guests outside, and Frasier jumps. Inside, Niles jumps higher, sending the ring flying up into the air.",
        "Frasier: NOT NOW!",
        "His nerves nearly shot, he closes the door, exhaling - then from outside comes the sound of tires squealing, a horn blaring, and a very heavy THUD.",
        "Frasier: [Walter Matthau] What the hell was that?!",
        "He runs out of the dining room, through to another exit. Daphne notices Niles peering around the floor.",

        "Too late. Eddie has scarfed the pate and swallowed the ring. Frasier runs back in.",
