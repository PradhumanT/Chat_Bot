        "ACT THREE",
        "Scene Seven - The Branford Inn Daphne re-enters.",
        "Daphne: There's a veterinarian's five minutes from here, I'm sure he can make Eddie cough up that ring.",
        "Frasier: All right then, off you go, both of you.",
        "Daphne and Niles exit with Eddie.",
        "Frasier: Hurry, please! We've only got the skywriter until five! As he settles down, he notices the heat growing in the room.",
        "Frasier: Clint, would you please turn up that air conditioning to the maximum? That ice sculpture over there is by the renowned artist Arthur Nudzac, and it's melting already!",
        "Clint does. In a few seconds, however, the unit sputters and dies with a rattle.",
        "Frasier: What's that?",
        "Clint: We just blew out the compressor.",
        "Frasier: Just don't just stand there, please, call a repairman.",
        "Clint exits. Roz knocks on the glass, with a crowd of highly agitated guests behind her. They are coughing.",
        "Roz: Frasier! Frasier! Frasier cracks the door.",
        "Roz: You have got to let these people in!",
        "Frasier: Yes, Roz, I'm sorry, I know it's warm...",
        "Roz: No, it's not the heat. That truck that just crashed was full of cattle.",
        "Distressed mooing is heard in the distance.",
        "Frasier: Well, the sound of gentle mooing in the background might lend a pastoral effect.",
        "Roz: Cattle, Frasier - large, un-diapered cattle that just heard a cannon go off!",
        "Frasier: Oh. All right, I'll handle this. Um, wedding guests, we thank you for your cooperation and your patience...",
        "Seeing the door open, the guests ignore him and push their way in, holding their noses.",
        "Frasier: People, people, please! But he's helpless to stem the tide.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Scene Eight - Vet's Office Daphne and Niles are seated in the waiting room with Eddie. Also seated are a man with a carrying cage, and a woman, Rachel, playing with a monkey perched on her shoulder.",
        "The vet, a young man named Dr. Hauck, comes out with a pill bottle.",
        "Hauck: [to the owner] Okay, here are your pills, twice a day. [leans down to the box's door] And you feel better, Mr. Kitty Cat.",
        "A harsh meow from the cage jerks him back. He straightens up.",
        "Hauck: Who's next?",
        "Rachel: I am. [the monkey cheeps]",
        "Hauck: Oh, gosh.",
        "[N.B. Arleen Sorkin has a long affiliation with Frasier. Aside from being the wife of executive producer Christopher Lloyd, she often voiced the parts of callers into Frasier's show during rehearsals and studio tapings, before the celebrity voices were dubbed in later. Of course, I remember her best as the voice of Harley Quinn on Batman: the Animated Series - her shining moment was successfully performing \"Amazing Grace\" on a kazoo. -- Mike Lee]",
        "Niles: Actually, we have an emergency here. Our dog swallowed a ring, and it's holding up a whole wedding.",
        "Rachel: Go ahead, I can wait.",
        "Daphne/Niles: Thank you./Thank you so much.",
        "Reset to: Examining Room Daphne and Niles follow Dr. Hauck in and place Eddie on the surgical table.",
        "Hauck: Boy, no easy ones today. Talk about hitting the ground running.",
        "Niles: Is this your first day?",
        "Hauck: Yep. I'm not in Kansas anymore.",
        "Niles: Where'd you go to vet school?",
        "Hauck: Kansas. All right, here we go. Now if you hold his mouth open for me, I'll see if I can get his paw down his throat... [off their shocked looks] I'm just kidding, I'm just... you know what, why don't I just take your pooch to the other room here, and I'll just, I'll be right back.",
        "Niles: All right.",
        "Hauck: Excuse me. [picks up Eddie] All right, buddy.",
        "Niles: Thank you.",
        "He carries Eddie to another room.",
        "Daphne: He has no idea what he's doing.",
        "Niles: Oh, he's just new at this, he's nervous.",
        "Daphne: I've been a bit nervous myself lately, ever since me brothers showed up.",
        "Niles: Really? Why?",
        "Daphne: Well, you know, the way they keep patting my stomach and saying, \"he's a Moon all right!\"",
        "Niles: [relieved] Oh my God, yes!",
        "Daphne: And every time they say that, all I can think is, what if he's not? What if he's like you and Frasier?",
        "Niles looks up, appalled.",
        "Niles: Excuse me?",
        "Daphne: Oh, a Moon boy I know how to handle. But what if he's a little genius - teasing me in French by the time he's six?",
        "Niles: [laughing] That is so funny - I've been worried he's gonna turn out like one of your brothers. I was sure when he kicked that speaker off your belly, that you had a little Simon in there.",
        "Daphne: [chuckles] They are a handful, my brothers. I can just imagine the hell they're raising back there.",
        "Niles: With an open bar?",
        "They chuckle - then Daphne suddenly clutches her stomach and we hear the sound of water trickling onto the floor.",
        "Daphne: [gasps] Oh my God, my water just broke! The baby's coming!",
        "Niles: Because I said \"open bar\"?!",
        "Daphne begins to scream as her contractions start.",
        "Niles: Oh, okay, all right, don't-don't panic, there's plenty of time to get you to a hospital.",
        "Daphne: Oh! - the hell there is, it's coming right now! Oh...!",
        "Dr. Hauck enters.",
        "Hauck: Here's your ring.",
        "Niles: Oh, here, here - [grabs the ring] Call an ambulance, my wife's having a baby!",
        "Daphne: There's no time for an ambulance! Oh!",
        "Niles: Oh my God!",
        "Hauck: Oh my God! Uh, uh, you know what, why don't you-you call",
        "Niles: All right!",
        "Hauck: ...and-and I'll just, I'll just get started here.",
        "Niles grabs a phone off the wall.",
        "Hauck: Oh, wait! Wait, wait, wait! [they stop and look at him] I'm going to wash my hands!",
        "As he rushes to the sink, panic makes Daphne scream even louder.",
        "Daphne: Are you sure you know what you're doing?!",
        "Hauck: Oh, I've assisted in many deliveries, ma'am. In fact, one just took blue ribbon at the Kansas State Fair.",
        "Daphne: Oh! Oh my God! Oh!",
        "Dr. Hauck helps her to lie on the surgical table.",
        "Hauck: Easy now, you're doing great, girl.",
        "Daphne: Don't call me that, I'm not a bloody poodle!",
        "Niles: [into phone] Yes, hello, hello! We're at, we're at, uh... [checks the phone] 1206 East Vilage Road, my wife's gone into labor! [to her] They say the hospital is twenty miles away, can you make it if I drive you-?",
        "Daphne's only response is a louder scream.",
        "Niles: She says no. He hangs up and faces Daphne.",
        "Niles: All right, they're on their way, they're on their way, now you just calm down. Focus on me, and breathe. Breathe...",
        "He begins Lamaze breathing, inhaling rapidly and blowing his cheeks out. Daphne looks at him and does the same. However, Niles's panic gets the better of him and his inhalations quickly turn to wheezing as he starts to hyperventilate, then passes out onto the floor.",
        "Daphne: Oh! Oh, for God's sakes! Oh!",
        "Dr. Hauck is still struggling into rubber gloves and a surgical mask when Rachel opens the door.",
        "Rachel: Is everything okay in here?",
        "Hauck: We're fine.",
        "Rachel: Okay. If you need any help, I'm a registered nurse. [starts to leave]",
        "Daphne: Oh, get the hell back in here!",
        "Hauck: Easy, girl.",
        "Daphne: Stop that!",
        "As she keeps gasping, we FADE TO:",
        "Scene Nine - The Branford Inn Back at the Inn, Frasier is presiding over chaos. All the guests are crowded into the dining room, sweating like pigs and fanning themselves frantically. In desperation, Roz opens the door and starts fanning the air with it.",
        "Frasier: Roz, do not open a window until they tow that cattle truck!",
        "Roz: God, it's a million degrees in here! We gotta get a breeze... [coughs] Oh my God!",
        "Roz, Frasier, and all the guests stagger and cough as the fetid breeze from outside fills the room.",
        "Martin and Ronee, dressed in suit and white gown, enter the room, and the stench hits them in the face.",
        "Martin: Oh my God! [he and Ronee hold their noses]",
        "Frasier: [putting a blithe face on it] Dad, Ronee! We're almost ready to start!",
        "Martin: What's that smell?",
        "Frasier: [pretending] Smell?",
        "One of the guests, an elderly lady, hastily exits with her husband.",
        "Guest: [holding her nose] Congratulations you two, everything's just perfect, sorry I can't stay!",
        "Ronee: What's happening?",
        "Frasier: There's been a bit of a mishap with a cattle truck, and-and the A.C.'s out. But no matter! Right, people? It'll take more than that to mar our joy at seeing these two become Mr. and Mrs. Martin Crane!",
        "BOOM! Everyone jumps - except Simon and Stephen, who just bellow with laughter again and clink their champagne glasses together.",
        "In the midst of this chaos, Frasier's mobile rings.",
        "Frasier: Hello? Well, finally, Niles! Stop babbling! Listen, Niles, you'll have to speak up, I can't hear you with that baby screaming in the backgr... Oh my God!",
        "He gets a joyous look on his face.",

        "Daphne: Isn't he perfect, Dad?",
        "Niles: He certainly is, Mom. He's got your eyes and my chin.",
        "Daphne: He's got my hair.",
        "Niles: You think so?",
        "Daphne: No, he's got my hair. Let go, dear.",
        "Rachel: If you can part with him for just two seconds, I should finish cleaning him up.",
        "Daphne: Of course.",
        "Niles: We can't thank you two enough.",
        "He looks at Dr. Hauck, whose mask is askew on his forehead, and who is struggling to remove his gloves.",
        "Hauck: [modest wave] Oh, please.",
        "Niles: Really, if there's ever anything that we can do for you...",
        "Rachel: You can do me one quick favor: my Jason is kind of overdue for his lunch.",
        "She indicates her monkey, perched on top of his cage.",
        "Niles: Oh, of course.",
        "CUT TO: Waiting Room The room is empty. Frasier, Martin, and Ronee come in, still wearing their wedding clothes.",
        "Frasier: Hello? Niles?",
        "Martin: Boy, some day, huh? Getting married and meeting my grandson all in the same afternoon.",
        "The door opens and there is Niles, holding a monkey tenderly under his arm and feeding him with a bottle.",
        "Niles: Hey, you guys! You're just in time, come on in! He goes back in, leaving the three gobsmacked.",
        "Martin: [to a gaping Frasier] Don't stare, you were no prize at that age either!",
        "Reset to: Examining Room Frasier, Martin and Ronee follow Niles in.",
        "Daphne: Oh, look who's here. Hello.",
        "Rachel enters from the washroom with the baby swaddled, and gives him to Daphne.",
        "Rachel: Here we go!",
        "Frasier: Oh my God, he's beautiful!",
        "Ronee: Yeah, that twin's gonna be jealous his whole life.",
        "Rachel: Your ambulance should be here any minute, so I think I'm gonna go.",
        "Niles: All right. Thank you again.",
        "Daphne: Thank you.",
        "Hauck: Uh, you sure you don't want me to check your monkey?",
        "Rachel: [embarrassed laugh] Yeah, I'm sure.",
        "She picks up Jason and his cage, and leaves. Dr. Hauck excuses himself to the other room.",
        "Niles: Thank you.",
        "Daphne: Thank you.",
        "Martin: [tickles the baby] Hey there, you! I'm the one who's gonna spoil you rotten.",
        "Daphne: Oh, you're so sweet to come down. But what about your wedding, all those people?",
        "Martin: Oh, they'll keep.",
        "Ronee: Yeah, as long as there's an open bar.",
        "Daphne: [to the baby] Ooh! Settle down there.",
        "Niles looks nervous. Outside they hear an ambulance siren.",
        "Niles: Oh, I guess that's our ride. I'm so sorry we're going to miss your wedding.",
        "Ronee: Oh, so are we.",
        "Daphne: I feel like it's me own dad getting married.",
        "Martin: [pats her head] Oh yeah, it's not gonna be the same without you guys up there.",
        "Niles: Well, don't let me forget the rings.",
        "He takes them out of his pocket.",
        "Ronee: Hey, wait a minute! Why don't we just get married here? I mean, we've got the rings, and-and the preacher...",
        "Martin: Well, what about all the guests?",
        "Ronee: Well, we can do it again for them later. And at least this place only smells like a monkey.",
        "Martin: Well, I'm game. Get cracking, Fras!",
        "Martin and Ronee stand on one side of the table. Daphne lies there, holding the baby. Frasier and Niles stand on the other side, and Frasier takes some speech cards from his pocket.",
        "Frasier: You know, I'd better, uh, condense this just a bit... [reading the cards] No, I don't need that... and I don't need that. All right... ah. [begins] \"It was the great thinker Horace Walpole...\"",
        "Martin: Don't need that.",
        "Frasier: [chucks the card] Well, all right then, uh... \"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here...\"",
        "A paramedic, Rob, opens the door.",
        "Rob: Someone call for an ambulance?",
        "Martin: Just a couple seconds, please.",
        "Rob looks puzzled, but obeys.",
        "Frasier: All right, Niles, uh, why don't you give them the rings?",
        "Niles: [does] Here.",
        "Frasier: I'll just cut to the chase here. Uh, do you, Martin Crane take Ronee Lawrence to be your lawfully wedded wife, forsaking all others, until death do you part?",
        "Martin: I do.",
        "Frasier: Do you, Ronee Lawrence, take Martin Crane...?",
        "Ronee: I do!",
        "As Martin fits the ring on her finger, Daphne laughs, choking up.",
        "Daphne: Oh, I'm tearing up.",
        "Frasier: You know, if they'd let me say what I planned to, you'd be bawling your eyes out right now.",
        "Martin puts the ring on and holds Ronee's hand.",
        "Frasier: By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you man and wife.",
        "They kiss tenderly and hug. Hugs and laughter follow all around. Then Niles opens the door to Rob.",
        "Niles: We're ready now. [to Martin and Ronee] We're so happy for you both.",
        "Daphne: Congratulations.",
        "The paramedics wheel a gurney in, and Niles takes the baby as they slide Daphne onto it.",
        "Niles: And, you will always remember your anniversary, because it's the same day as your grandson's birthday.",
        "Martin: Yeah, and Eddie's!",
        "Ronee: What?",
        "Frasier and Niles freeze.",
        "Martin: Uh, never mind.",
        "Ronee: Eddie's birthday is today? So that's how you came up with May 15th for the hotel?",
        "Martin: Uh...",
        "Ronee: I knew it! And you've been blaming the inn all this time - oh, you are so busted!",
        "She walks out, Martin follows her slowly. Frasier, Niles, and Daphne watch him, concerned.",

        "Scene Eleven - Apartment It is evening, the rain is pouring outside. Frasier is sitting on his couch, enjoying a book and a glass of sherry. After a few minutes, he closes his book, drains his glass, then picks up the cordless phone and dials.",
        "Frasier: Hello, Lilith. Hey, it's me. Yeah, listen, I was just calling to check out how Freddy's doing. What, a new one? I thought he was smitten with the old one. Well, you know, he gets that from me. Back in my heyday, I had a new chess coach every month. [chuckles] Well, I'm... spending a lot of time alone lately. Well, you know, Dad and Ronee are still on their honeymoon. Oh yes, they thank you for that very thankful radon detector you sent. Not seeing much of Niles and Daphne either, because they're so busy with the baby... Oh! Uh, sorry to keep you. Yeah, just, uh, just tell Freddy to call me. Okay, bye, Lilith.",
        "He hangs up. He goes to the balcony door and opens it, listening to the sound of the rain.",
        "Someone rings the doorbell. Frasier eagerly goes to answer it, to a Moving Man.",
        "Frasier: Oh.",
        "Man: Here to pick up a chair?",

        "The Man levers the chair onto his dolly and wheels it to the door. But Frasier betrays some affection.",
        "Frasier: Uh, be careful with it. The Man slips it through the door, and it is gone.",

        "He hands her a piece of jewelry.",
        "Bebe: My baby's all grown up. [She puts her hands on his face] I look in your eyes and I see something there that I've never seen before.",
        "Frasier: Wisdom?",
        "Bebe: Crow's feet. Sorry, darling, but you're going to be on TV now. I talked to my face man, he can see you at four o'clock. [dangles a card in front of him]",

        "Martin: Yeah, and he'll be here for Christmas... and Thanksgiving... and birthdays... and... [convincing himself] We'll be sick of this guy!",
        "Frasier: Yeah, Dad's right. I mean, once I'm gone there'll be no getting rid of me.",

        "Frasier: You all know how I feel about you, and the only reason I'm leaving is because I want what all of you have now: a new chapter. Who knows if it'll even work out? [looking to Martin] But it's like that Tennyson poem Mom had us recite for you when we were kids. Do you remember?",

        "Frasier: I've been thinking about that poem a lot lately. And I think what it says is that, while it's tempting to play it safe, the more we're willing to risk, the more alive we are. In the end, what we regret most are the chances we never took. And I hope that explains a little this journey on which I'm about to embark. I have loved every minute with my KACL family and all of you. For eleven years you have heard me say, \"I'm listening.\" Well, you were listening too. And for that I am eternally grateful.
