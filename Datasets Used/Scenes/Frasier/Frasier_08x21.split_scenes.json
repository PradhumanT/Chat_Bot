        "While shopping for a DVD player, Frasier meets an attractive woman called Claire. He soon discovers that she is a friend of Lana, former prom queen of his school whom he dated briefly in the past. Claire confides in him that she is organizing a surprise birthday party for Lana, and asks Frasier if he can bring her, pretending it is a friendly date; Frasier agrees, but only to gain access to Claire, whom he finds more appealing. However, Lana already has someone in mind to match up with Claire, so at the party he has to compete for her attention. Lana is also looking for someone to tutor her son in U.S. History."

        "ACT ONE",
        "Scene One - Electronics Store Frasier is standing in line with Niles, who is holding a box.",
        "Niles: You sure Daphne will like this one?",
        "Frasier: Oh, it's perfect, Niles. Look, it even says on the box, \"for the perfect DVD viewing experience.\"",
        "Niles: [reading] What do you suppose \"multi-angle capability\" means?",
        "Frasier: [know-it-all] Well, it means that the remote control will respond from any angle.",
        "The woman standing ahead of them (Claire) turns around.",
        "Claire: Not to intrude, but actually it means you can see a scene from different camera angles.",
        "Niles: Oh, thank you.",
        "Frasier: Oh, I-I was just, uh, teasing him. You see, my brother's technologically challenged.",
        "Claire: If you're, uh, new to DVD, you might want to rent the director's cut of \"Das Boot.\" It's amazing - I mean, if you don't mind subtitles.",
        "Frasier: Mind them? I prefer them! In fact, I-I do speak a-a bit of German, so in this case they might actually be a distraction!",
        "Claire: Really?",
        "Frasier: Mmm.",
        "Claire: I speak German too.",
        "Niles: You know, if anyone's technologically challenged, it's you.",
        "Frasier: He's a bit defensive. [adds something in German]",
        "Claire: [responds in kind; they laugh]",
        "Niles: You thought your CD-ROM drive was a cup holder.",
        "Claire, not wanting to get between them, walks off.",
        "Frasier: Thanks a lot! I was interested in her.",
        "Niles: Well, how was I supposed to know?",
        "Frasier: I was speaking German!",
        "Niles: Oh yes - the language of love!",
        "[N.B. Frasier did not speak German as of [2.21], \"An Affair to Forget.\" Perhaps he has learned since then, or that earlier episode was simply inconsistent - since it is virtually required that any serious student of Freud should read him in the original German.]",
        "Behind Niles, Frasier sees Lana Gardner come into the store.",
        "Frasier: Oh dear, it's Lana, it's Lana.",
        "Niles: [excited] Where, where?",
        "Frasier: Oh my God, no, no, just turn around, turn around! I don't know why the woman frightens me.",
        "Niles: Well, she should frighten you, she was prom queen!",
        "Lana and Claire spot each other.",
        "Lana: Hi! Sorry, it took me forever to find a parking spot. [Claire hands Lana the shopping bag she's carrying] Thanks. [sees Frasier] Frasier!",
        "Frasier: Lana! Uh, look Niles, it's Lana.",
        "Niles: [giggling like a teenager] Hi, Lana.",
        "Lana: Hi! Oh, this is my friend, Claire French. Frasier Crane, his brother Niles - we've known each other since high school.",
        "[N.B. Clare (no \"i\") French is the name of a producer's assistant on \"Frasier.\"]",
        "Frasier: Yes, we've already met. Uh, guten tag, Claire.",
        "Claire: I knew I'd recognized your voice. You're on the radio.",
        "Frasier: Yes, yes, well, I'm flattered that you've listened.",
        "Lana: You should have seen him in high school. Do you remember when you petitioned the school to have interpretive dance added to gym class? [laughs]",
        "Frasier: Oh, is that a CD organizer? I'll be right back! [moves off]",
        "Claire: Oh, I need one of those myself, excuse me.",
        "She follows him.",
        "Lana: So Niles, how's things? She lightly caresses the DVD box, setting off fresh giggles in him.",
        "Niles: Things are good.",
        "Lana: Are you married now?",
        "Niles: No, no. I was, but, uh, I'm not now. [cocksure] But I'm goin' with someone.",
        "Clerk: Next!",
        "Lana: Oh yes, I need to return this. [takes a portable stereo from the bag and puts it on the counter]",
        "Clerk: Oh, it's scratched.",
        "Lana: Well, it was like that when I bought it.",
        "Anyone who's seen \"Big Crane on Campus\" can tell where this is going. Over to Frasier and Claire, looking at CD organizers:",
        "Frasier: You know, I'm not much of a faux walnut grain enthusiast.",
        "Claire: Uh, Frasier, I-I wanted to ask you something. Saturday night, are you free?",
        "Frasier: Only with a coupon. [they laugh] What did you have in mind?",
        "Claire: Well, a bunch of us are throwing a surprise party for Lana, I was wondering if you could bring her.",
        "Frasier: Well, I'm not sure I'm the right person for this. You see, last year Lana and I dated for a brief period, and, uh, well, things just didn't work out. Don't get me wrong, it's not that she isn't a lovely person-",
        "At the counter:",
        "Clerk: Next.",
        "Lana: I don't give a rat's ass about your policy! Get me the manager!",
        "Frasier: Perhaps you could ask someone else.",
        "Claire: Come on, just ask her out as a friend. Once you're there, you can leave... [with unmistakable suggestiveness] Or stay.",
        "Lana: Are you calling me a liar?! [to the whole store] DON'T BUY",
        "ANYTHING HERE, THE SERVICE SUCKS!",
        "She smiles sweetly at Niles, who is beginning to understand his brother's fear.",
        "Frasier: Well, it is her birthday.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Scene Two - Apartment Martin, wearing his glasses, has the DVD player on his lap. Niles stands next to him.",
        "Martin: Red wire, red wire, where do you go? Oh, here we are. He plugs it in - immediately, they hear feedback. He yanks it out.",
        "Martin: Uh, maybe the red wire's extra. Niles, hand me that yellow one, will you?",
        "Niles reaches for it, but winces and clutches his arm.",
        "Martin: What's the matter?",
        "Niles: Oh, Daphne punched me in her sleep last night. Honestly, she is the most aggressive sleeper I have ever known.",
        "Martin: Wow. You being a psychiatrist, you probably think she's acting out some form of repressed hostility towards you, huh?",
        "Niles: That was the furthest thing from my mind... until now.",
        "Martin: Oh, don't worry about it. Sounds to me like you guys are still finding your sleeping groove.",
        "Niles: Sleeping groove?",
        "Martin: Yeah. First six months your mother and I were together, we were like Dempsey and Tunney! [then] You see, Dempsey and Tunney were-",
        "Niles: Oh Dad, please, I know a little something about vaudeville.",
        "Daphne comes out of the hall with a DVD.",
        "Daphne: I've got our movie. Niles stands and strikes a mock boxing stance.",
        "Daphne: Oh, knock it off! [punches his arm lightly] I told you I was sorry.",
        "Niles: [rubbing his arm] It's all right. [sees] \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\"",
        "Daphne: Yeah, it's got everything - action, romance, and humor. I mean, who's funnier than Roger Rabbit?",
        "Niles: No one?",
        "Daphne: Exactly.",
        "Frasier comes out in his suit.",
        "Frasier: Well, I'm off to pick up Lana.",
        "Niles: You're oddly chipper about it.",
        "Frasier: Well, of course I am, Niles. The sooner I deliver her to the surprise party, the sooner I can cast my net of romance over a butterfly named Claire. You know, I've got a good feeling about this one.",
        "Niles: Oh Frasier, you always have a good feeling. You think it's going to be perfect, and then when she turns out not to be the Kierkergard-reading, souffl\u00e9-baking, haiku-writing cellist, you're disappointed. You have to learn to settle.",
        "Daphne: [looks at him] What does that mean?",
        "Suddenly on the spot, Niles opens his mouth, but no words come out.",
        "Frasier: Have fun, Niles. He opens the door, just as Roz is about to knock on it.",
        "Roz: Oh, hi!",
        "Frasier: Roz, hi.",
        "Roz: Where are you going?",
        "Frasier: Oh, just to a little party.",
        "Roz: Have a good time.",
        "Frasier: Bye!",
        "He leaves.",
        "Roz: Hey, everybody. Am I too late?",
        "Martin: No, you're perfect. We're all hooked up and ready to go.",
        "Roz: Great. I brought \"Caddyshack\"! Who's funnier than that gopher?",
        "Daphne: Roger Rabbit, that's who-",
        "Martin: Hey, what about my movie, \"The Longest Day\"? It's got D-Day and the Duke!",
        "Niles: Whoa, that is an embarrassment of riches. Each movie more appealing than the last. Well, perhaps there's a happy compromise in \"The Unbearable Lightness of Being.\"",
        "[holds it up]",
        "Roz: Well that would be a happy compromise, except for one thing: Boring!",
        "Martin plugs in another wire - feedback again.",
        "Daphne: I think we should use the manual.",
        "Martin: I don't need a manual! I need a pair of wire strippers, a hammer, and a beer. [goes to the kitchen]",
        "Niles: All right, well, while he's doing that I just have to pose",
        "the question: who's funnier than Daniel Day-Lewis?",
        "Daphne and Roz look at him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "WHAT WOMEN MAY OR",
        "MAY NOT WANT",
        "Scene Three - Frasier's BMW Frasier is driving Lana.",
        "Frasier: You look lovely tonight.",
        "Lana: Thank you, you look nice too.",
        "Beat.",
        "Lana: Look, I'm gonna be real direct. We're just two good friends going out for dinner, OK?",
        "Frasier: Of course.",
        "Lana: I only say that because you went a little heavy on the cologne, and I don't want you to have any expectations.",
        "Frasier: I have nothing of the sort. And by the way, it's scented soap.",
        "Lana: I mean, I only accepted because it really sounded like you could really use a night out. I don't want some awkward scene where you try to get in my pants.",
        "Frasier: I assure you, there will be no such scene.",
        "Lana: Good. [pause] Unless of course I have too much to drink, [slightly manic laughter] and I change my mind!",
        "Frasier: So, how are those kids of yours doing?",
        "Lana: Oh, my youngest is good, he's in the ninth grade. But Kirby, if he doesn't pass U.S. history he's not going to graduate.",
        "Frasier: Well, have you considered getting a tutor?",
        "Lana: That's a good idea. You used to do that sort of thing in high school, didn't you?",
        "Frasier: Well, yes, yes, I-I did. And I-I would do it for Kirby in a heartbeat. It's just that I'm asked a lot, and if I helped him I'd have to do it for everyone, and I'd hate to open those floodgates. You understand.",
        "Lana: Yeah. I mean, my ex is the one I should be asking, but that would be a waste of time.",
        "Frasier: He doesn't help out with the kids?",
        "Lana: No, the only kid he has time for is Kathy, his 22-year old receptionist. It's sickening. Mind if I smoke?",
        "Frasier: Well, actually-",
        "Lana: I'll just crack a window.",
        "She does, and lights up.",
        "Lana: You know, I'm glad you asked me out tonight. Tomorrow is my birthday!",
        "Frasier: Really? Oh, happy birthday.",
        "Lana: Hardly. That's the day Bob and Kathy have chosen to get married - in Tahiti! Some birthday.",
        "As she gazes mournfully out the window, Frasier picks up a small can of air freshener and sprays.",
        "Lana: All right. That's good, tonight'll get my mind off of it. Just promise me that I won't even hear the word \"birthday\" for the rest of the night, OK?",
        "Frasier: Are you sure? I mean, maybe a big celebration would be the best revenge.",
        "Lana: [almost crying] What am I celebrating? The fact that I'm becoming an old trot and no one's ever going to love me again? Oh God, shut up! [stubs out her cigarette]",
        "Frasier makes a decision, and turns sharply.",
        "Lana: Aren't we going to Bella Lucia?",
        "Frasier: Well, actually I-I know this little Thai place that I think will be better.",
        "Lana: Well, were you even going to ask me? I hate Thai food! Typical man, \"I like Thai food, so she must like Thai food.\"",
        "Frasier turns sharply in the other direction.",
        "Frasier: All right, Bella Lucia it is.",
        "Lana: I'm sorry, I'm-I'm being snappy. It's just... I-I guess I just always thought that I'd be the one who got remarried first, you know? Now everybody's just going to feel sorry for me. Oh God, I hope I don't run into anybody I know tonight! [Frasier is worried] And you're not a typical man. You're very thoughtful. Forgive me?",
        "Frasier, despite himself, is charmed.",
        "Frasier: Yes, I'm afraid I do. Oh gosh - you know, I-I do know another little Italian place that I think you might really enjoy just as much - well, what do you say?",
        "Lana: Great, sounds great.",
        "Frasier: OK.",
        "Lana: You know, it's funny, as much as I hate the thought of my birthday, I'm kind of hurt that none of my friends asked me to do anything. I mean, not like I wanted a party, but, well, something would have been nice.",
        "Frasier, unable to take anymore of this, brakes harshly and pulls over.",
        "Lana: OK, OK, Frasier, you know what, just because I'm vulnerable doesn't mean you're getting some!",
        "Frasier: No! Listen: fifty of your friends are sitting in Bella Lucia right now, wearing party hats and waiting to yell, \"Surprise!\" Do you want to go or not?",
        "Lana: [happy] My friends are throwing me a surprise party?!",
        "Frasier: That's right.",
        "Lana: [Carrie] And you tell me and ruin it?!",
        "END OF ACT ONE",
        "ACT TWO",
        "Scene Four - Bella Lucia Claire and the rest of Lana's friends are waiting when Lana walks in.",
        "All: SURPRISE!",
        "Lana: [feigned] Oh my god, you didn't! [to Claire] You, you did this!",
        "She hugs Claire, as Frasier follows her in. Frasier follows her in.",
        "Lana: Frasier, you tricked me, you awful thing! [shoves him playfully]",
        "Frasier: It wasn't easy, you nightmarish carp!",
        "He gives her a not-too-gentle shove back, and heads for the bar. Claire puts a tiara with \"Happy Birthday\" on it on Lana's head, and gives her a drink.",
        "Lana: Thank you - Debbie, oh hi! Bruce, hi! I am so thrilled you all came here for this! I thought a lot of you would have flown to Tahiti for the wedding of Dumbo and Bimbo!",
        "Claire follows Frasier.",
        "Claire: Thanks for getting her here.",
        "Frasier: Well...",
        "Claire: How did you manage to keep it a secret?",
        "Frasier: Well, as a psychiatrist, discretion happens to be the cornerstone of my profession.",
        "Claire: Ah, of course. Mine too - I'm a family therapist.",
        "Frasier: Really? You know, I-I sensed we have a lot in common.",
        "Claire: You know, it's funny how things turn out. I started out as a music major, studying the cello.",
        "Frasier: You're a cellist?",
        "Claire: Yes, but psychology is my true calling. \"Spawning fish that leave upstream for many seasons, yet come home to stay.\"",
        "Frasier: Was that a haiku?",
        "Claire: Yes. It's, uh, it's a habit of mine. They just sort of spill out of me.",
        "Frasier: Well, that's amazing! [loosens his collar] Uh, may I get you a drink?",
        "Claire: Yes. Uh, a martini - two olives.",
        "Frasier: Ah. I knew it.",
        "He turns to the bar, but turns back just to check:",
        "Frasier: Kierkergard?",
        "Claire: Love him.",
        "Frasier: Don't move.",
        "He goes to the bar.",
        "Lana: Claire! What are you doing staring at the moon? I want you to meet Neil, the guy I told you about.",
        "Frasier turns back from the bar with two martinis - and sees Claire talking with Lana and a handsome man in an expensive suit.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Scene Five - Apartment Martin and the gang are still sat around the living room. Roz reads a magazine, Daphne looks through the manual for the DVD player while Martin fumbles with the cables.",
        "Martin: All right, what's it say now?",
        "Daphne: \"Alternatively, see Appendix C: Advanced Troubleshooting Specifications and You.\"",
        "Martin: That's it, I quit. [throws cables up in the air]",
        "Daphne: Well, what do you want to do?",
        "Niles comes out of the kitchen with a glass of wine.",
        "Roz: Well, I went to a party once where we each went around the room and confessed our most shameful secret - except it had to be something that you've never told anyone before.",
        "Niles: Oh, I don't think that's something we really want to get into.",
        "Daphne: No, sounds like fun.",
        "Niles: OK, I'll go first. Oh, let's see - all right, well, Daphne, you might as well make your acquaintance with my dark side. In fifth grade, there was a bully, Jack Winfield, who was bothering a lot of the girls, so one day I waited for him outside of school and gave him a sound thumping.",
        "Martin: Wasn't that the kid with rickets?",
        "Niles: Rickets and a smart mouth.",
        "He hangs his head, and Daphne puts a sympathetic hand on his knee.",
        "Roz: Daphne, you go next, and think of something juicier than that.",
        "Daphne: Oh, well, um, mine's also a youthful indiscretion. I stole a teddy bear from the shops.",
        "Roz: Then what?",
        "Daphne: Well, I felt guilty, so I told my parents and we brought it back. Then as a penance, I... volunteered to work at the orphanage after school.",
        "Roz: What the hell was that?! I'd put that story on my resume! Come on, Martin, you've got to have something! Shock me!",
        "Martin: Oh, I don't know, it's kind of personal.",
        "Roz: That's what we're looking for.",
        "Martin: Well, all right, but it doesn't leave this room: every time I watch \"The Sound of Music\"... I cry. And I don't mean a single manly tear. I mean real blubbering, girl-style. The nuns... those kids... that lonely goatherd.",
        "Roz: These are your deep, dark secrets? This is baby stuff! \"Ooh, I dropped my ice cream and I ate it!\"",
        "Daphne: OK, let's hear yours, then.",
        "Roz: Oh, you can't handle mine. Let's play \"Clue\" or something.",
        "Everyone exclaims, \"Oh, come on!\"",
        "Martin: Are you kidding? We can take anything you could dish out! I was in the war, I was a cop, I even worked Vice!",
        "Roz: I don't think so.",
        "Martin: Well, come on, I'll tell you what: whisper it in my ear, and if I think they can handle it I'll tell them.",
        "Roz: OK.",
        "She cups a hand to his ear and whispers. As she does, his smile disappears, and his face goes from shock to outright horror. She finishes. He stumbles out of his chair, not even looking at Niles and Daphne, and hurries to his room, stopping only to cast one more horror-stricken glance at Roz, who triumphantly tosses her hair back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "TUESDAYS WITH FRASIER",
        "Scene Six - Bella Lucia Lana, half in her cups, is sitting at a table with three nervous guests (the only ones left).",
        "Lana: [mournful] Where was Kathy while I was busting my ass putting him through dental school? Oh, oh, that's right - she wasn't",
        "BORN YET!",
        "Guest 1: Who wants more cake?",
        "Guest 1: Not me, but I'll go with you!",
        "They get up and leave the table. At the bar, Claire is wedged between Neil and Frasier. She is holding a glass of red wine, but Frasier hands her another.",
        "Frasier: Here we are. This is one of my favorites.",
        "Claire: That's so sweet of you, but Neil just brought me a glass.",
        "Frasier: Oh, this one. Yes, that's a delightful little wine, yes, it's very nice. But this happens to be a Bavaresco Diam, the greatest Italian red since Roberto Rossellini! [laughs]",
        "With both men watching her like hawks, she uncomfortably sips one, noises \"Mmm,\" to the gratification of Neil, and then the other, also with an \"Mmm,\" to Frasier's delight.",
        "Claire: Well, they both taste wonderful. I-I don't, I can't choose between them.",
        "Frasier: Taste mine again.",
        "Neil: You know, if you're really interested in wine, Claire, you should let me fly you down to Napa in my plane. We could spend the day exploring vineyards.",
        "Claire: Oh, that's very sweet, but those little planes make me nervous.",
        "Frasier: Well, how do you feel about, uh, BMW's? You see, I-I happen to know several of the proprietors of the local vineyards here, and I'd be delighted to be your tour guide.",
        "At the other side, all the guests have now left, and Lana is alone at her table.",
        "Claire: That sounds tempting.",
        "Frasier: Well, allow me to enchant you further. You see, I...",
        "He notices Lana has begun to cry.",
        "Frasier: Claire, I'm sorry, uh, you'll have to excuse me for just a moment.",
        "He abandons the field to Neil, and sits next to Lana.",
        "Frasier: Hi. How you doing?",
        "Lana: Everybody's leaving.",
        "Frasier: Well, it's getting late.",
        "Lana: It's 9:30! Let's face it, I drove them all off. Even I'm sick of hearing me complain about Bob.",
        "Frasier: No, come on, it's not all that bad. I mean, listen, you know, Bob is in the past. I mean, just look at all the friends you have. I know you've had a bit of a tough time lately, but it'll end soon. You're a vibrant, attractive woman.",
        "Lana: Thanks, Frasier. You're being awfully sweet to me. Don't think this means you're getting any.",
        "Neil and Claire reach the door.",
        "Neil: We're, uh, saying our goodbyes.",
        "Frasier: Oh, you're leaving?",
        "Claire: Uh, I have an early appointment and Neil offered to give me a ride home.",
        "Frasier: Well, how thoughtful of him.",
        "Claire: Happy birthday, Lana. [they hug] It's nice to see you again, Frasier.",
        "Frasier: Lovely seeing you again, Claire. Neil...",
        "They shake hands, Neil with a small, triumphant smile. They leave and Frasier sits back down.",
        "Lana: Threw a gutter ball, huh?",
        "Frasier: Thanks to you, you introduced them.",
        "Lana: Well, you played it all wrong! You were hanging on her all night!",
