    "Recap": [
        "While out shopping for a couch, Frasier and Niles encounter Ronee Lawrence ( Wendie Malick ), a former babysitter from years ago who turned down Frasier's affections and used to tell Niles scary bedtime stories . They learn that she is now working as a singer and pianist at a local hotel. Having established also that she is divorced, Frasier takes the opportunity of inviting her round to his house for cocktails that evening. Martin is delighted to see Ronee, and soon both he and Frasier are flirting with her. They both pursue her to the Wellington Hotel to see her play, and continue competing for her attention. Frasier persuades her to duet with him, but is disappointed when she sings directly to Martin - and his mood is reflected in his playing. As Ronee and Martin grow closer, Frasier goes through a spell of depression , and since he is due to start private psychiatry again soon, Niles becomes worried."

        "(Scene 1 - A Furniture Store",
        "[Fade in. Niles and Frasier are walking around the showroom, looking at couches.]",
        "Niles: Oh, now look at that couch. Now this is something you might want to consider for your new office. Although, I'm not sure how well that, what is that, sort of linen, is going to wear. Oh, you know what I'm going to wear at the opera fund raiser on Friday night? Or is it Saturday? I'll check my book. A lovely linen shirt with my new Zegnia suit.",
        "[He lays down on the couch.]",
        "Niles: That's a funny word, \"Zegnia\". The \"g\" is silent. Silent \"g\" like lasagna.",
        "Frasier: Niles?",
        "Niles: Yes?",
        "Frasier: Do you notice that you've been awfully chatty lately?",
        "Niles: No, but Daphne mentioned it to me this morning.",
        "[He gets up.]",
        "Niles: Oh, what about this one? Frasier, you really must make a decision. We've been to six stores already, and oh, that reminds me, I must cancel our squash game tomorrow...",
        "Frasier: Don't you hear that?",
        "Niles: Yes, now that you mention it, I do. It's sort of like a nervous tic of some kind. I wonder what could be causing it.",
        "Frasier: Well, let's see: you do have a baby on the way. Perhaps your incessant jabbering is just a way of distracting yourself from this life changing event.",
        "Niles: How could I have missed something so obvious?",
        "Frasier: Well, it's not so hard to believe. You were fifteen before you discovered there was a correlation between being beaten up every day and going to school in a Panama hat.",
        "[Niles takes out his handkerchief and dusts off a couch, then sits down. Frasier stares at a woman across the showroom.]",
        "Frasier: Niles!",
        "Niles: Hmm?",
        "Frasier: Does that woman look familiar to you?",
        "Niles: No, but do you know what does? This couch. We're back where we started, will you pick something?",
        "Frasier: My God! That's Ronee Lawrence.",
        "Niles: Who?",
        "[Niles gets up.]",
        "Frasier: She used to baby-sit for us. Oh my God, I had a crush on her. She's the first girl to ever break my heart. I used to watch her through the banister, making out with her boyfriend. Chad.",
        "Niles: Ronee Lawrence! She's the fiend who told me all those ghastly bed time stories about tiny insects that would crawl into my ears and eat my brains. Earwigs! I, I wore a football helmet to bed for a month that year!",
        "Frasier: Yes, I know, you really had Dad's hopes up there for a while.",
        "[Frasier walks over to the woman.]",
        "Frasier: Excuse me, are you Ronee Lawrence?",
        "Ronee: That's what it says on my driver's... wait a sec. Frasier? Oh, my God, it is you.",
        "[They hug.]",
        "Frasier: It's good to see you. Niles and I were just...",
        "Ronee: Niles! Oh, my God, little Nervous Niles? I can't believe it!",
        "Niles: Oh, well, it's all terribly true.",
        "Frasier: You look fantastic.",
        "Ronee: Oh, well, it's a lot of work.",
        "Frasier: Of course it is. You know, exercise, dieting and all...",
        "Ronee: No, I've had a lot of work.",
        "Frasier: Oh.",
        "Ronee: Every time something sags, drags or bags, I get Dr. Goldman right on top of it. And then I call a plastic surgeon.",
        "[She nudges Niles and laughs.]",
        "Niles: Funny. Well, it's nice running into you.",
        "Frasier: Niles, we've got a moment, I think. So, what have you been up to?",
        "Ronee: I sing and play the piano down at the Wellington Hotel.",
        "Frasier: Oh, great, great.",
        "Ronee: Of course, I know what you do, mister big-time radio shrink.",
        "Frasier: Oh, well, actually I'm getting back into private practice as well. In fact, we're here today picking out a couch for my new offices. I saw you checking out the Barcaloungers. Are you buying a chair for your husband?",
        "Ronee: Only if it's wired for electricity. We're divorced.",
        "Frasier: Oh, well, you know, you must come by the house to do a proper catch up. I know my dad would love to see you again.",
        "Ronee: Well, actually, I'm free tonight.",
        "Frasier: Well, then how about cocktails around seven? I'm at the Elliot Bay Towers, on the Counterbalance.",
        "[Niles lays down on another couch.]",
        "Ronee: Great. It'll be just like old times. Except you get to stay up late. Hey, Niles, do you remember when I used to tell you those scary bed time stories?",
        "Niles: No, not really.",
        "Ronee: Yeah, yeah. You thought there were earwig eggs on all the furniture and you started taking one of those hankies out and wiping off all the chairs before you'd sit in them because you were afraid...",
        "[She makes crawling and burrowing motions at his head.]",
        "Niles: Nothing still, I'm sorry.",
        "Ronee: I'm glad. For a while there I was afraid that maybe I scarred you for life. Bloop!",
        "[She pokes at his head and he stiffens up.]",
        "Ronee: Well, I gotta run, I'll see you guys tonight.",
        "Frasier: Okay, bye.",
        "[He watches as she hurries off, then turns to Niles.]",
        "Frasier: Okay go ahead, Niles.",
        "[Niles twitchily gets up and gets a handkerchief.]",
        "Niles: Oh, she put her fingers in my ears....",
        "Frasier: I know, I know...",
        "Niles: She was just...",
        "Frasier: I know, give it a good one.",
        "[Niles rubs his ears with the handkerchief and then furiously wipes down the couch. Fade out.]",
        "(Scene 2 - Frasier's Apartment",
        "[Fade in. Niles and Daphne are on the couch, Frasier is opening a bottle of wine.]",
        "Daphne: So, Frasier, did you find a couch?",
        "Niles: No, I must've tested a hundred for him.",
        "Frasier: You know, have some sympathy, Niles. Obviously, my foot-dragging is a kind of avoidance. After all, I haven't been in private practice for twelve years. Maybe I don't have the skills anymore.",
        "Daphne: Oh, don't worry. Your patients will never notice.",
        "[Niles gets an hors d'oeuvre.]",
        "Niles: Yes, well, if he doesn't pick a couch soon, patients will be lying on the floor. What is this? It smells...oh, it's olive topinade! Your going to an awful lot of trouble for a \"Drop by sometime\" kind of evening. Here Daphne, try this, ooh, try one of these. Ooh, spring rolls. Oh, we found the best Chinese restaurant today...",
        "[Daphne slaps him on the arm.]",
        "Daphne: Niles!",
        "Niles: Sorry.",
        "Frasier: Still got the gift of gab, I see.",
        "Niles: I really don't know why you insisted we be here tonight.",
        "Frasier: I just didn't want Ronee to think I was coming on too strong. I was hoping this reunion might lead to a countdown for a future liftoff from Cape Crane-averal.",
        "Niles: If you tortured that metaphor anymore, you'd be before a tribunal in the Hague.",
        "[Martin comes in the front door with Eddie.]",
        "Frasier: Oh, Dad. Hey.",
        "Martin: Hey, guys. Wow, what's with the fancy spread?",
        "Frasier: Niles and I ran into Ronee Lawrence today and she's coming over for cocktails. You remember, our old babysitter.",
        "Martin: Oh, yeah. I remember Ronee. Pretty little thing. Yeah, how's she looking these days?",
        "Niles: Eyes pulled so tight she could land a roll in \"Flower Drum Song\".",
        "Frasier: She happens to look fabulous.",
        "[The doorbell rings and Frasier goes to answer it.]",
        "Frasier: Which you will soon see for yourself. She's playing the piano down at the Wellington.",
        "[He opens the door, it is Ronee.]",
        "Frasier: Ronee, hi. Come on in. Good to see you.",
        "[She enters.]",
        "Frasier: Meet my sister-in-law, Daphne.",
        "Ronee: Hi.",
        "Daphne: Nice to meet you.",
        "Frasier: And of course, you remember my dad.",
        "Ronee: Of course. How are you Mr. Crane?",
        "Martin: It's Marty and I'm just great. Gee, you haven't changed a bit.",
        "Ronee: Oh yes I have. I can legally drink now.",
        "[They all laugh.]",
        "Ronee: Hint hint.",
        "Frasier: Oh right. Would you like a glass of wine?",
        "Ronee: Yes. Thank you.",
        "[Frasier walks over to the table.]",
        "Frasier: Dad, why don't you get yourself a beer?",
        "[Martin sits back down.]",
        "Martin: So, Ronee, what have you been doing with yourself all these years?",
        "Ronee: Singing, mostly, I play at the Rendezvous Room down at the Wellington Hotel.",
        "Daphne: Is that that place that revolves?",
        "Ronee: It used to. It broke two years ago.",
        "[Martin bursts out laughing.]",
        "Martin: That's terrific.",
        "Ronee: Yeah, I had a couple of shots at the big time, you know, sang in some swankier rooms, I even made an album. Ronee",
        "Lawrence: Mood Swings. It sold about seven copies and that's when Ronee Lawrence had herself a real mood swing.",
        "[Frasier hands her a glass of wine.]",
        "Frasier: Well I'm sure the album was just wonderful. You know, maybe I can interest you in a duet a little later.",
        "Ronee: Oh, that'd be fun.",
        "Frasier: Wouldn't it, though? I have a feeling that our musical styles just might harmoni...",
        "Martin: So, Ronee, I bet you really wow them at the Rendezvous.",
        "Ronee: You know, it's not exactly Carnegie Hall. Most of them are half in the bag and just trying not to spill their drinks. And I'm just talking about the cocktail waitresses.",
        "[Martin laughs loudly again.]",
        "Martin: This girl's a riot!",
        "Frasier: Dad, could you help me with something in the kitchen?",
        "Martin: Now?",
        "Frasier: Right now!",
        "[They start for the kitchen.]",
        "Ronee: Don't be long, you two. Mama likes an audience.",
        "Martin: Good. 'Cause Daddy likes to watch.",
        "[Frasier pulls him the rest of the way into the kitchen. Cut to - the kitchen as Martin is pulled around.]",
        "Frasier: What the hell do you think you're doing?",
        "Martin: I was working my magic on her. Why are you so upset?",
        "Frasier: Because I'm working a little magic of my own. And your magic was mucking up my magic!",
        "Martin: Well, I thought you brought her here for me.",
        "Frasier: Since WHEN do I bring you women?! What are you, the Sultan of Brunei?",
        "[Cut to - the living room. Ronee's cell phone goes off and she answers as Martin and Frasier come back into the room.]",
        "Ronee: Hello? ... What? ... Oh, you're kidding. ... Yeah, yeah, okay I guess. I'll see you in a bit.",
        "Frasier: Something wrong?",
        "Ronee: Oh, I have to go into work. The guy who fills in on my night off called in sick.",
        "[She stands up and finishes off her wine.]",
        "Frasier: Oh, no.",
        "Niles: Sorry.",
        "Ronee: Promise me we'll do this again.",
        "Frasier: You know we will. You can count on that.",
        "Martin: Try to keep us away.",
        "Ronee: Frasier, you owe me a duet. It was great to see you, Marty. You should all come down to the club sometime.",
        "Martin: You can count on that too.",
        "Frasier: We'll be there with bells on.",
        "[He opens the door for Ronee and she leaves.]",
        "Martin: Bye.",
        "Frasier: Bye, see you later.",
        "[Frasier closes the door and glares at Martin.]",
        "Frasier: I can't believe the way you are humiliating yourself. A man your age!",
        "Martin: Hey, she was flirting with me!",
        "Frasier: She was flirting with me! You just got caught in the crossfire.",
        "Martin: Daphne, you saw it. Which one of us was she attracted to?",
        "[He gets his jacket and puts it on.]",
        "Daphne: How stupid do you think I am? Does it say \"Stupid\" on me forehead?",
        "Frasier: Fine. If you insist on humiliating yourself, how's this: I will invite Ronee over for dinner this weekend and she can choose for herself. Agreed?",
        "Martin: Fine. Make sure she brings a friend so there's someone for you.",
        "[He opens the door.]",
        "Martin: I'm going to McGinty's.",
        "[He leaves. Frasier stares at the door for a moment.]",
        "Frasier: You don't suppose he's sneaking down to the Rendezvous, do you?",
        "Niles: No. Only a scoundrel would violate a gentleman's agreement that way.",
        "Frasier: Quite right. Dad is nothing if not an honorable man. I don't know what I was thinking.",
        "[He walks back towards the bedrooms.]",
        "Niles: Can we give you a lift down there?",
        "Frasier: No, I want to freshen up first. See yourselves out.",

        "Ronee: Don't change a hair for me... [to a customer] You've only got the two. Not if you care for me... It's a good thing you've got money. Stay little valentine, stay... Like you've got anywhere else to be. Each day is Valentine's Day.",
        "[The patrons applaud as she finishes.]",
        "Ronee: I'm going to take a little break. Try not to kill yourselves with disappointment.",
        "[She gets up as Frasier walks in. She hurries over to him.]",
        "Ronee: Hey, Frasier, what a nice surprise.",
        "Frasier: I guess I just didn't want our little reunion ending so abruptly.",
        "Ronee: Well, you're not the only one.",
        "Frasier: I had a feeling you might say that.",
        "[Martin comes up and hands Ronee a drink.]",
        "Martin: Here you go, Ronee.",
        "Ronee: Thanks.",
        "Martin: Hey, Fraizh.",
        "Frasier: Dad!",
        "Ronee: Yeah, Marty didn't want to call it a night, either. He's quite the party guy. [looking across the room] Walter, you're alive!",
        "[She walks off.]",
        "Frasier: You said you were going to McGinty's. How long have you been here?",
        "Martin: Forty-five minutes. You shouldn't have spent so long on your hair, Louise.",
        "[Ronee comes back.]",
        "Ronee: So boys, who needs a drink?",
        "Martin: Yeah, I'll have another beer.",
        "Frasier: You know, Dad, you really ought to slow down there. At his age, one slip and it's the ICU and then it's I see you later.",
        "Martin: Well, I wouldn't worry about me, Fraizh. I don't feel any older now than I did when you were parading around in your mother's heels.",
        "[They all laugh.]",
        "Martin: Of course, that was just last Christmas.",
        "Ronee: Listen, I've gotta do another set. Are you going to stick around?",
        "Frasier: Oh, you bet we are.",
        "Martin: Yeah, sure. Wouldn't miss it. Ronee got me a ringside table right next to her.",
        "Ronee: And that's because I want you and your pockets right near my tip jar.",
        "Martin: Oh, you're after my money, huh?",
        "Frasier: Say, Ronee, it's such a beautiful piano, it's a shame we didn't get a chance to do our duet.",
        "Ronee: Well, let's do it now.",
        "Frasier: Really?",
        "Ronee: Yeah, sure. You don't mind scrunching, do you? My bench is a little small.",
        "Frasier: I don't mind scrunching at all.",
        "[He smirks at Martin. Then sits next to Ronee. She covers the microphone and whispers to Frasier.]",
        "Ronee: Listen, is it just me or am I getting some signals here?",
        "Frasier: Oh, it is most definitely not just you.",
        "Ronee: Hi, drinkers, I'm back. And no, no, you're not seeing double, for once. I have a guest with me tonight. Believe it or not, I used to baby-sit this guy. I know, I know, how does she stay so young?",

        "Frasier: Oh, I love this song.",
        "Ronee: Oh, me too. You know, I'd like to sing it to someone special who's here tonight, but I'm afraid it might embarrass him.",
        "Frasier: Oh, I'm sure you special someone would just love to hear it.",
        "Ronee: Really? Okay then, here goes.",
        "[Frasier begins playing while Ronee sings.]",
        "Ronee: I get no kick from champagne. Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all. So tell me then why it should it be true, That I get a kick out of you?",
        "[She seductively points at Martin and Frasier misses a chord. Embarrassed, he plasters on a smile and keeps playing, banging the keys louder as she goes on..]",
        "Ronee: I think you're cute, Marty Crane. I think that if your poor hip wasn't stiff You could dance just terrifically, too. And I get a kick out of you.",

        "Frasier: Yeah. Pizza guy forgot to close it when he left. What're you doin' here?",

        "Niles: No, but thanks for offering. [sitting] Frasier, what's going on with you? You're showing classic signs of depression.",
        "Frasier: That's because I'm depressed, you nit!",
