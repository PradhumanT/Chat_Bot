    "Recap": [
        "Roz wins a free trip to a ski lodge, including lessons from a skiing instructor, but is talked into trading them to Frasier in return for a big-screen TV. So Frasier decides to take the whole family to the ski lodge, including Daphne and her friend Annie (played by guest star Cynthia Lamontagne ), a swimsuit model. There they meet Guy (played by guest star James Patrick Stuart ), a gay ski instructor, who likes Niles and thinks Niles likes him back. This is confirmed by misinformation given by Martin who has hearing difficulty due to a blocked ear. Throughout the episode, confusion arises as Frasier pursues Annie, who desires Niles. Niles, however, longs to confess his feelings for Daphne, while Daphne attempts to pick up Guy, who thinks that Daphne and Annie are together."

        "ACT ONE Scene One - KACL Frasier has just finished his show. Roz comes in from her booth.",
        "Frasier: Oh well, good show today, Roz. I particularly thought that- Roz notices a woman, Connie, talking to an employee in the hall.",
        "Roz: Oh my God, there's that Connie from Promotions. Every time she sees me, she hits me up for another charity.",
        "Frasier: You know, Roz, maybe it's time you set some limits. Good lord, how hard can it be to say \"no\" just once? Oh well, look who I'm talking to.",
        "Roz bats his arm. He shrugs. Connie comes in.",
        "Connie: Hi, Frasier. Roz, I was looking for you-",
        "Roz: O.K. wait, Connie, before you say anything, there's something I need to get off my chest. I have bought Girl Scout cookies from you, I have paid for your kids' band uniforms, I've bought tickets to every raffle your church ever had, and I'm tapped out. So whatever it is you came to say to me, I'm not interested.",
        "Connie: Well, I'll just go then. [turns to leave, then] Oh, by the way, my church had its raffle drawing yesterday. You won the grand prize. [drops an envelope on the console] Sorry to bother you.",
        "Connie leaves.",
        "Roz: [calling after her] Oh, Connie, Connie, I'm sorry, Connie, don't - oh, who cares, what'd I win?",
        "She grabs the envelope and rips it open.",
        "Roz: Oh my God! It's that free ski weekend!",
        "Frasier: Oh, Roz!",
        "Roz: Listen to this: \"Dear winner, you will enjoy a one-weekend rental of a deluxe private ski lodge on Mt. Baker, complete with lessons from a former Olympic champ!\"",
        "Frasier: That is a grand prize indeed! I must admit, I'm just a bit envious. Well, listen, I hope you have a wonderful weekend.",
        "Roz: Well, thank you, Frasier.",
        "Frasier: Just seems a pity you won't be able to take advantage of those ski lessons.",
        "Roz: Well, there'll be other stuff to do.",
        "Frasier: Oh, tons, tons! Just because you can't ski - or for that matter hike, sled, or snowboard - doesn't mean you can't still curl up in by a roaring fire with a nice warm snifter of... oh, sorry.",
        "Roz: Well, the scenery will be nice.",
        "Frasier: Breathtaking! I just hope you can endure the four-hour drive up there, and you so carsick these days...",
        "Roz: OK, Frasier, I know what you're hinting at. This is the first thing I have ever won in my entire life, and it means something to me. So I'm not going to sell it, or give it away, or trade it for a...",
        "Frasier: Big-screen TV?",
        "Roz: Key's in the envelope.",
        "Frasier: Thank you.",
        "He takes the envelope and leaves.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Scene Two - Frasier's Apartment - Night Martin is watching a baseball game on TV. The sound is turned up very loud. The doorbell rings, and Daphne crosses the room with a basket of laundry.",
        "Daphne: What do you need that so loud for? I swear you've gone deaf as a post!",
        "Martin: It's just a cold stopping up my ears, I'll be fine.",
        "Daphne opens the door to Niles, who is on his cell phone.",
        "Niles: Dear God, man, whose lawyer are you, anyway? No, I will not calm down! [coming in] They call that a settlement? You call them and turn it down. [louder, over TV] I said, turn it down, you ninny!",
        "Martin: Geez, you could at least ask nicely!",
        "Martin grabs the remote and turns the TV down. Niles hangs up.",
        "Niles: I've got to get a new divorce lawyer. Claude is clearly no match for Maris's team.",
        "Daphne: Real sharks, are they?",
        "Niles: When we were courting, I sent Maris a valentine that said, \"You're the girl my heart adores, Everything I have is yours.\" Now they're calling it a pre-nup.",
        "Daphne: That's terrible! [to Martin] Can you imagine using that as a weapon - an old valentine?",
        "Martin: I'd love a cold Ballantine!",
        "Daphne: That does it! You're getting a hearing aid, whether you like it or not!",
        "Martin: I don't need a hearing aid! My hearing will be back to normal in no time.",
        "Daphne: You said that two days ago. Soon you won't be able to hear a word I say.",
        "Martin: Gee, wouldn't that be a tragedy?",
        "He turns back to the game. Daphne scowls and walks behind the chair.",
        "Martin: [taking a shot] I heard that.",
        "Daphne: I didn't say anything!",
        "Frasier comes in.",
        "Frasier: Well, what are you all loitering around here for when you should all be packing?",
        "Daphne: Packing for what?",
        "Frasier: For the fabulous ski weekend I'm taking us on!",
        "Niles: You're kidding! You won the raffle?",
        "Frasier: In a manner of speaking. It's a gorgeous ski lodge, and an Olympic champion in residence to give us lessons!",
        "Daphne: Oh, sounds like heaven! Skiing all weekend, then warming up with a nice hot rum drink, curled up under a blanket in front of a roaring fire...",
        "Niles: I can feel the steam rising off my toddy already.",
        "Daphne: Oh, damn! I can't go.",
        "Niles: [alarmed] Why not?",
        "Daphne: My friend Annie. It's her birthday this weekend, and I promised I'd spend it with her.",
        "Niles: Well, bring her along.",
        "Frasier looks sharply at Niles.",
        "Daphne: Well, I know she'd love it. She's very gung-ho for sports. She was captain of the girls' rugby team at school.",
        "Frasier: Well, I'm not sure how many bedrooms there are.",
        "Niles: Well, if we're short, she can have mine.",
        "Daphne: Where will you sleep?",
        "Niles: Well, I'll think of something.",
        "Daphne: [to Frasier] Are you sure you wouldn't mind?",
        "Frasier: Oh well, yes, why not? I mean, what could be more fun than a gung-ho girls' rugby captain?",
        "Daphne runs off to her room.",
        "Frasier: I will kill you for this!",
        "Niles: I'm sorry, but it was the only way Daphne was going to come, and if you think I was going to let a moonlit ski lodge go to waste, you can think again.",
        "Frasier: You filed for divorce a week ago. Can't you wait awhile?",
        "Niles: Wait? I have waited five long years for this. Dad, don't you think it's about time?",
        "Martin: [checking his watch] Uh, I got ten after five.",
        "Frasier: Listen, Niles, if you want to make a fool of yourself with Daphne, that is your affair. But frankly, I will not have you ruin my ski weekend by inviting along this girl that sounds to me like an avalanche risk! I'm going to tell Daphne, no guests!",
        "Daphne comes back.",
        "Daphne: I called Annie. She's all excited. Turns out she just bought new skis with the money she made off her new swimsuit calendar.",
        "Daphne goes to the kitchen. Frasier turns to Niles.",
        "Frasier: Well, I hope you're happy. We're stuck with her now.",
        "Even as he speaks, he's unable to keep the smile off his face, or the gleam out of his eye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Scene Three - Ski Lodge - Day The lodge has a living and dining room area with a fireplace. Off this is a small kitchen. Another downstage door leads to a bedroom. Doors leading to two more bedrooms face each other upstage. Stairs beyond this lead to a second floor landing with doors to three more bedrooms.",
        "Niles and Martin, wearing winter outfits, enter carrying luggage.",
        "Niles: Wow, look at this place!",
        "Martin: Wow, look at this place! Nothing like a change of scenery, huh? [looks around] Where do you suppose the TV is?",
        "Niles: At this altitude, I'm surprised my ears haven't stopped up. How's it affecting your ears, Dad?",
        "No response.",
        "Niles: Dad?",
        "Martin: What?",
        "Niles: How are your ears?",
        "Martin: [covering badly] Great! Never been better! No hearing aid for me!",
        "Niles turns away. Martin madly flexes his jaw to pop his ears, without success. Frasier comes in with more luggage.",
        "Frasier: [calling back over his shoulder] No need to struggle with that, Annie. I'll be back to help you in a moment. Oh, this place is terrific!",
        "Niles: Yes. I'm just glad we got here alive. The way you were taking those curves so sharply, poor Annie kept getting thrown up against you.",
        "Frasier: [naughtily] Well, what can I say? I'm a bad driver.",
        "Niles: I grant you she's comely, but don't you find her a tad - what would the polite euphemism be - stupid?",
        "Frasier: Niles, she is just unschooled, like Liza Doolittle. Find her the right Henry Higgins, she'll be ready for a ball in no time!",
        "Niles: Leave it to you to put the \"pig\" back in \"Pygmalion.\"",
        "Frasier: Thank you.",
        "Daphne and Annie - a blond, British woman in her twenties with a supermodel figure - enter with the last of the luggage.",
        "Daphne: Goodness, this place is just lovely!",
        "Frasier: Yes, isn't it, though? [motioning out the window] I mean, look at that vista, it's stunning! Puts one in mind of the Matterhorn, doesn't it?",
        "Annie: Oh, I wouldn't know. I'm not very musical.",
        "Niles gives Frasier a look. Martin opens an Igloo cooler and pulls out two large bottles of rum.",
        "Martin: Oh, that's a relief! The way you were swerving on the ride up here, I was afraid these'd get broken. I'm gonna make us all a batch of my special hot buttered rum!",
        "Frasier: You're actually going to put butter in the rum?",
        "Martin: It's cold in the mountains, you need a little fat in your booze.",
        "Martin takes the bottles to the kitchen.",
        "Frasier: Good thinking, Dad. After we're done, I'll whip us up a nice batch of pork-nog.",
        "Frasier and Niles laugh.",
        "Annie: None for me, thanks, I'm a vegetarian.",
        "Niles: Daphne, let me help you with your luggage.",
        "Daphne: Oh, thank you.",
        "Niles: Uh, which room do you want?",
        "Daphne: Oh... [points] That one upstairs on the left should have a nice view.",
        "Niles: What a coincidence, that's right next to mine.",
        "Annie: Oh, I'll take the one next to that.",
        "Frasier: Allow me.",
        "Frasier takes Annie's bags and exits with Niles, leaving the two women alone.",
        "Annie: That Niles is quite a cutey. Now he's the one getting divorced?",
        "Daphne: Yeah. Poor thing's been just miserable.",
        "Annie: Well, I may just have to cheer him up.",
        "Daphne: You just leave Dr. Crane alone. No offense, but I've seen the way you go through men. The last thing he needs is for someone else to break his heart.",
        "As Daphne speaks, she zips up the front of Annie's jumpsuit, covering her more-than-slightly exposed cleavage.",
        "Annie: But it's my birthday! And besides, you're not his nanny.",
        "Unseen by them, Guy, their ski instructor, enters with a bag of groceries. He's darkly tanned, French, and very good-looking.",
        "Daphne: Can't we just have a nice relaxing ski trip? Does this whole trip have to be about s*x?",
        "Guy: Allo.",
        "Daphne turns around - and blushes.",
        "Daphne: Hello.",
        "Guy: I am Guy.",
        "Daphne: Daphne.",
        "Annie: Annie.",
        "Guy: I hope you are ready to ski tomorrow. I'm going to work you very hard.",
        "Daphne: Oh! [giggling]",
        "Guy goes to the kitchen. Daphne turns to Annie.",
        "Daphne: Dibs on the Frenchman.",
        "Annie: You can have him.",
        "Frasier emerges from one of the bedrooms.",
        "Annie: He's not half as cute as Dr. Crane.",
        "Frasier: Oh, enough already, my ears are burning!",
        "Guy comes back into the living room, as Martin and Niles also come out.",
        "Daphne: Everyone, did you meet Guy, our ski instructor?",
        "Frasier: [shakes hands] Hello, Guy.",
        "Guy: I will also be your chef tonight, Entrec\u00f4te a la Guy.",
        "Niles: A ski champion and a gourmet - vous \u00e9t\u00e9s tr\u00e8s formidable.",
        "Guy: Parlez-vous francais?",
        "Niles: Oui, j'ai habit\u00e9 \u00e0 six mois \u00e0 Paris quand j'\u00e9tais un \u00e9tudiant.",
        "Guy: You speak very well.",
        "Annie: Oui!",
        "Frasier: Oh, you speak French as well?",
        "Annie: No, all I know how to say is \"oui.\"",
        "Frasier: [naughtily] Well, that should be enough to get you through the weekend.",
        "Martin looks out the window.",
        "Martin: Aw, look at that. Two deer in the snow, just kind of nuzzling each other.",
        "Everyone noises \"Awww,\" and \"How cute,\" etc.",
        "Daphne: How romantic.",
        "Frasier: Yes, it's enough to put ideas in one's head.",
        "He steals a glance at Annie.",
        "Annie: Isn't it? She steals a glance at Niles.",
        "Niles: Yes. He steals a glance at Daphne.",
        "Daphne: I should say so. She steals a glance at Guy.",
        "Guy: Absolument.",
        "Guy leans back and steals a glance at Niles's butt. Then they all go back to staring out the window.",
        "Martin: Well, I guess I'd better start that rum cooking.",
        "END OF ACT ONE",
        "ACT TWO",
        "COULD GUY'S LAST NAME",
        "BE FEYDEAU?",
        "Scene Four - Ski Lodge - Night After dinner. Guy is stoking the fire. Daphne hovers over him, while Annie is on the couch with a mug of hot rum.",
        "Daphne: Look at you - you're handy, a chef, a ski champ. Is there anything you don't do?",
        "Guy: There are a few things.",
        "Niles comes down the stairs in pajamas and a dressing gown.",
        "Guy: Oh, Niles, you look tr\u00e8s \u00e9l\u00e9gant!",
        "Niles: Yes, I simply had to change. After all that wine and good food, I felt I was going to burst out of my trousers.",
        "Annie: Ooh, my!",
        "Daphne: Annie.",
        "Frasier comes out of his room, also in pajamas and a dressing gown that's a little more garish than Niles's.",
        "Daphne: Oh, Dr. Crane, what a smashing robe!",
        "Frasier: Thank you.",
        "Daphne: [to Annie] Doesn't he look handsome?",
        "Annie: [uninterested] Oh, yeah, quite. Oh, look - I've finished my buttered rum.",
        "Frasier: Never let it be said that Frasier Crane would permit a lady to go thirsty. Daphne, why don't you see if Dad's finished with that second batch?",
        "Daphne takes two mugs and goes to the kitchen, where Martin is standing over a large pot of rum on the stove. He's still trying to pop his ears.",
        "Daphne: Two more.",
        "Martin: Almost there. I just need to replace some of this rum that's boiled off.",
        "Daphne: Oh, yeah, just what Annie needs. She's all over poor Dr. Crane as it is, and after I begged her to leave him alone. Why couldn't she be hot for Frasier?",
        "Martin: What?",
        "Daphne: Annie - hot for Frasier!",
        "Martin: Oh.",
        "Daphne: [looking out the door] I should just forget about those two and concentrate on Guy. Now he's the sort of tall drink of water I could really go for.",
        "She leaves. Martin obligingly opens the fridge and gets out a bottle of spring water, and turns just in time to see Frasier come in.",
        "Martin: Here you go.",
        "Frasier: Oh, well, thank you, Dad, but actually it's the rum I'm interested in. I think it's just the thing I need to clinch things with Annie.",
        "Martin: Oh, Annie, huh? I know something about that - she's hot for you.",
        "Frasier: Says who?",
        "Martin: Daphne. She said, \"Annie's hot for Frasier.\"",
        "Frasier: I knew my charms would win her over! My God, I should register this dressing gown with the love police.",
        "Out in the living room, Annie is seated on the coffee table, facing Niles, with a sympathetic hand on his knee. Niles is uncomfortable, while Daphne hovers disapprovingly.",
        "Annie: Oh, I know the pain you're going through. I mean, I've never been divorced myself, but my last boyfriend was... eventually. What you need is something to take your mind off it. [gets up and starts to sit down on his lap] I'll tell you what always works for me-",
        "Daphne: [grabbing her] Time to go upstairs!",
        "Annie: What for?",
        "Daphne: I need to give you your birthday present. It's in my room.",
        "Annie: [to Niles] I'll see you in a bit.",
        "They go upstairs. Niles sighs with relief - and starts as he notices Guy sitting right next to him on the couch.",
        "Guy: Allo.",
        "Niles: Hi.",
        "Guy: Your friend Daphne, she did not like the way Annie was flirting with you.",
        "Niles: No, she didn't, did she?",
        "Guy: In fact, she dragged Annie right off to her bedroom.",
        "Niles: I think I know what that means.",
        "Girlish laughter comes from Daphne's room.",
        "Guy: I think we both know. Daphne was jealous.",
        "Niles: [elated] She was jealous, wasn't she? I don't believe it!",
        "Guy: I am surprised by nothing. You know, I think you did not like Annie's flirting either.",
        "Niles: Oh, was it that obvious?",
        "Guy: Annie is not your... cup of tea?",
        "Niles: Well, [leans in; whispers confidentially] Just between us, my interests lie elsewhere this weekend.",
        "Guy: [suavely] Really?",
        "Frasier comes out of the kitchen.",
        "Frasier: Rum's ready!",
        "Niles: Ah. Guy, perhaps you could help my dad with the drinks?",
        "Guy: I am at your service.",
        "Frasier: Thank you, Guy.",
        "Guy goes to the kitchen. Niles excitedly goes up to Frasier.",
        "Niles: Daphne wants me!",
        "Frasier: She told you that?",
        "Niles: Well, no. But Annie was flirting with me, and Daphne dragged her off to her room in a jealous rage!",
        "Frasier: No, no, no, Niles, Annie was not flirting with you. She's hot for me.",
        "Niles: I think I know when I'm being flirted with.",
        "Frasier: Oh, please, Niles, you're going beyond the limit that time. You're delusional! Next thing, you'll be telling me that Guy's after you!",
        "Niles: All right, now you're dreaming things up...",
        "In the kitchen, Guy and Martin sample some of the rum.",
        "Guy: How do you like your rum?",
        "Martin: Well, it's kind of small, but it's got a nice view.",
        "Guy: [holds up his mug] No, your rum.",
        "Martin: [seeing] Oh, yeah, yeah. Could you speak up a little?",
        "Guy: [speaking louder] I wonder if it's clouded my judgment about something. Your son Niles - is it my imagination, or is he attracted to-?",
        "Martin: Hold it right there. It's not your imagination. He's got it bad.",
        "Guy: Really?",
        "Martin: Mmm.",
        "Guy: This is not a delicate subject for you?",
        "Martin: Oh, no, no. Niles has had those feelings for years. 'Course, I didn't encourage it during his so-called marriage, but now that he's free, whatever makes him happy - I say go for it!",
        "Guy: You are a wonderful father.",
        "Martin and Guy carry a tray of mugs into the living room. As they come in, Daphne and Annie come back down, both wearing nightgowns. Daphne's is covered by a robe, while Annie only wears a flimsy sheath over her shoulders.",
        "Martin: O.K., everybody, come and get it!",
        "Niles: Daphne, just in time.",
        "Frasier: Annie, that's a lovely gown.",
        "Annie: Daphne just gave it to me.",
        "Guy: [knowingly] I'll bet she did.",
        "Everyone takes a mug and sits around the coffee table.",
        "Frasier: [sipping] Mmm, Dad, this batch is even stronger than the last one!",
        "Martin: Yeah... first time I made this was for your mother. I'd been wanting to pop the question but I was afraid she'd say no. This gave me the nerve to ask her and I got myself a great big \"yes\"... and that wasn't the only \"yes\" I got from her that night either. [laughs] Still scares me to think how close I came to chickening out, though. You know, as you get older, it's not the failures you regret, or the times you made an ass of yourself. It's the times you never even tried, when you just lost your nerve.",
        "Frasier: Wise words.",
        "Niles: Hear, hear.",
        "Frasier: Faint heart never won fair lady.",
        "Annie: I certainly hope that if a man fancied me, he wouldn't be afraid to take a chance, go for a bold gesture.",
        "Wheels begin turning in Frasier's head.",
        "Niles: Yes, we must never be too timid to pursue our heart's desire.",
        "Guy: And not give a damn what the world thinks... right, Miss Moon?",
        "Daphne: Indeed. [giggles into her mug]",
        "Martin: Takes an hour to make one of these things, but it's worth it just to sit here and savor every sip.",
        "Everyone agrees. Then they all throw theirs back and replace their mugs on the table.",
        "Daphne: I'm done.",
        "Niles: Time for bed.",
        "Guy: I'm ready.",
        "Annie: Me, too.",
        "Frasier: 'Night, Dad.",
        "They get up and head for their rooms.",
        "Martin: What? You're not going to bed already, are you? Oh, fine. Goodnight.",
        "Guy: Enjoy your rum!",
        "Martin: Well, I'd enjoy it more if it had a TV in it.",
        "Martin turns out the lights in the living room. Guy exits to his room. Annie and Daphne, slightly tipsy, exit also - but to the rooms opposite the ones they took earlier. Frasier and Niles stop.",
        "Niles: I thought Daphne's room was...",
        "Frasier: They must have switched.",
        "Frasier and Niles exit to their rooms. Daphne and Annie come back out, giggling.",
        "Annie: I took the wrong room.",
        "Daphne: Yes, I thought we got that backwards.",
