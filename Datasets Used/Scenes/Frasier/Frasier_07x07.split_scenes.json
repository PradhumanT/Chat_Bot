        "Act One.",
        "Scene One - Caf\u00e9 Nervosa. Frasier enters the caf\u00e9 to find Roz at one of the front tables surfing the net on a laptop. Frasier sits with her.",
        "Frasier: Hello, Roz.",
        "Roz: Hey.",
        "Frasier: Oh, what are you up to?",
        "Roz: Oh, they put in phone jacks so you can go on-line. I was just talking to this guy who sounds really great. [Frasier sighs as if the idea is absurd] What? I'm a very busy person, how else am I going to meet people?",
        "Frasier: It just seems so impersonal, Roz. God, what ever happened to human contact? Engaging people, face to face, eye to eye.",
        "Roz: [points out Martin at counter] There's your dad.",
        "Frasier: Don't let him see me! [turns away as Martin crosses to the table]",
        "Roz: Hey, Marty.",
        "Martin: Hey, Roz.",
        "Roz: Hey.",
        "Martin: What you been up to?",
        "Roz: Oh, just surfing the net.",
        "Frasier: Hi, Dad.",
        "Martin: [ignoring his son] You know, I never got into that net stuff.",
        "Roz: Really? You really ought to give it a try. It's a great way to stay in touch with your friends and your family.",
        "Martin: Family? Gosh, you know, that's nice to know that some people still care about their family.",
        "Frasier: Dad, please!",
        "Martin: Well, I gotta go. I'm going night-fishing with Duke - and Eddie, of course! I wouldn't leave Eddie, you don't turn your back on your family!",
        "Martin exits the caf\u00e9.",
        "Roz: What is that all about?",
        "Frasier: Oh, our Cousin Dodie's wedding was last week. Oh, excuse me, Cousin Dodie's \"weddin'!\" A western theme. On the response card it asked for our chili preference: mild or \"kick ass!\" Anyway, Niles and I told her that we had a conference to attend at the Therapist's Guild.",
        "Roz: There is no Therapist's Guild, is there?",
        "Frasier: No. Dad found us out.",
        "Roz: Wait! Didn't you have a Therapist Guild conference on Alice's last birthday?",
        "Frasier: [changing the subject] The point is, it struck a nerve with Dad! [then] I'm sorry, Roz, it's just that he thinks we're ashamed of his family, it's been an issue with him for years, and now he hasn't spoken to me for days. Thank God, I don't have to deal with this tonight. I've already ear-marked a fine bottle of Chateau Beychevelle.",
        "Roz: Oh, hot date?",
        "Frasier: No, Niles is coming over to watch \"The Antiques Roadshow\" with me.",
        "Roz: [mocking] I guess you'll be coming in late, tomorrow!",
        "Frasier: It's our favorite show, Roz.",
        "Roz: Party!",
        "Frasier: All right, that's enough.",
        "Roz: Whoo!",
        "Roz carries on mocking Frasier as the picture FADES TO BLACK.",
        "Scene Two - Frasier's Apartment. The lift doors open outside Frasier's apartment. Niles and Frasier step off of and cross to the door. They are carry wine and nibbles.",
        "Frasier: I think the roadshow is from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania tonight. Amish country!",
        "Niles: Ooh, quilts!",
        "They enter the apartment.",
        "Frasier: I'll cork the wine, Niles, you set up the cheese cakes.",
        "However they are startled when Martin enters from the kitchen with some nachos and a can of beer.",
        "Frasier/Niles: Dad!",
        "Frasier: I thought you were going night fishing with Duke?",
        "Martin doesn't reply as he nestles in his chair with the remote.",
        "Frasier: Oh, for God's sakes, you can't keep this up forever, Dad. [no response] Well, all right, fine. I hope you don't mind, but Niles and I are planning on watching a television show.",
        "Martin: Oh, really? Well, I'm surprised you don't have a conference to go to!",
        "Frasier: Dad, we said we were sorry about Dodie's wedding.",
        "Niles: Yes, and we did send her a baby gift.",
        "Martin: Well, Duke cancelled out on me. You can have the TV in an hour. I just want to watch my game show.",
        "Frasier: Oh please, not a game show?",
        "Martin: Hey, I happen to like it, all right? People bring in all their junk from the attics and these experts tell them what it's worth.",
        "The brothers realize that this summary is very similar to the show they are about to watch.",
        "Frasier: Are you talking about \"The Antiques Roadshow?\"",
        "Martin: Yeah.",
        "Frasier: Well, that's the program Niles and I are going to watch!",
        "Martin gives a look of disbelief, so do the brothers.",
        "Niles: I'll just check outside and see if the world has ended.",
        "Niles enters the kitchen to set up the cheese cakes as Frasier heads to the couch opening the wine.",
        "Martin: Well, if you want to watch it, no one's stopping you.",
        "Frasier: Well, wonderful. [laughs]",
        "Martin turns on \"The Antiques Roadshow.\"",
        "Presenter: [v.o.] And you have no idea what this writing desk might be worth?",
        "Woman: [v.o.] No, my husband bought it at a garage sale.",
        "Frasier: That's a lovely piece. I'd say it's Sheridan.",
        "Presenter: At auction, this would bring in more than eight thousand dollars.",
        "Martin: Whoa-ho-ho! Ca-ching!",
        "Niles enters with the cheese.",
        "Woman: What about this chair? Is it an original too?",
        "Niles: It certainly looks it.",
        "Martin: Ah, no, they always do this. Set 'em up on the first one and then lower the boom on the second one.",
        "Niles: I think that carving looks authentic.",
        "Frasier: So does the inlay.",
        "Martin: No, no, no!",
        "Presenter: I'm sorry to say this chair is a reproduction, worth at best one hundred and fifty dollars.",
        "Woman: Oh, what a shame.",
        "Martin smiles at the disbelieving boys.",
        "Martin: Keep watching, boys. You'll get the hang of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Scene Three - Frasier's Apartment - Later. The three Crane men are getting very friendly at last. Niles is sat on the floor with a wine glass in his hand. Frasier's sat on the coffee table with a wine glass. Martin is in his chair with a can of beer. \"The Antiques Roadshow\" is still running.",
        "Presenter: [v.o.] But the real clue here is the veneer.",
        "The Crane men, playing their drinking game, all shout out \"veneer!\" and take a swig of their drinks.",
        "Presenter: And now for some background information on the beautiful city of Harrisburg.",
        "Martin: Mute!",
        "Frasier and Niles laugh as Martin turns the sound off. Daphne enters with a green box.",
        "Daphne: Evening, all. [they greet her] Wow! I don't see the three of you watching the same show very often. What's going on? Pavarotti jumping the Grand Canyon?",
        "Martin: It's \"The Antiques Roadshow.\" What you got in the box?",
        "Daphne: Oh, it's Donny's mother's wedding gown. He wants me to wear it at the wedding. What if I don't like it?",
        "Frasier: Daphne, if you want to try it on, we'll be glad to have a look.",
        "Martin: Just go put it on.",
        "Daphne exits with the box to her room.",
        "Frasier: Dad, Dad, turn it up. [he does]",
        "Sara Briggs: But the real masterwork is the unique art deco headboard. It features a variety of veneers.",
        "They all shout out \"veneer!\" and sip.",
        "Sara Briggs: Mahogany veneer... Once again.",
        "Sara Briggs: Burled walnut veneer... Yet again they swallow another swig.",
        "Sara Briggs: And zebra wood veneer. For the final time they take one last drink.",
        "Sara Briggs: And now back to our...",
        "Frasier: [recovering] Oh God... next week we gotta pick a different word. Need another bottle of wine, Niles.",
        "Martin: Yeah, me too, I love these educational shows.",
        "Frasier enters the kitchen with the old bottle of wine as Niles also brings in Martin's old beer cans. Frasier gets a new bottle as Niles gets another beer from the fridge for his father.",
        "Frasier: You know, I can't get over Dad. It seems this little rift between us has been mended.",
        "Niles: Can you believe he used the word \"craftsman,\" and he meant the architectural style, and not the rotary sander?",
        "Frasier: You know, that's uncanny.",
        "Niles: Well, you heard him.",
        "Frasier: No, not that, you just said \"rotary sander.\"",
        "They go back into the living room.",
        "Frasier: Dad, did we miss anything?",
        "Martin: Nah, just some bozo with a credenza who doesn't know a Biedermeier from an Oscar Meyer.",
        "They all laugh. The theme music for the show's end plays.",
        "Presenter: That's it for this week. See you next time on \"The Antiques Roadshow.\" Next Saturday the roadshow will be here in Seattle.",
        "Martin: Oh!",
        "Presenter: Viewers can bring their treasures to the convention center for a free appraisal.",
        "Martin: We oughta go, that'd be great.",
        "Frasier: Well sure, Dad.",
        "Niles: That does sound like fun.",
        "Martin: Yeah, I'm going to go and have a little root around in our closet. I bet I can find a nice little [correct pronunciation] objet d'art they'd be interested in.",
        "Martin exits to his room, leaving his sons gobsmacked again.",
        "Niles: It's as if that panhandler I gave money to was a genie granting all my wishes.",
        "Daphne: Would you marry me in this?",
        "We see that Daphne has entered. She is wearing the \"wedding gown.\" It consists of white go-go boots, a fluffy white veil and very little else. In fact, just a white miniskirt connected to a tight white bra by flimsy suspenders. Niles nearly faints.",
        "Frasier: [whispers] How much did you give him?",
        "Niles: It's attractive, Daphne. It's a bit unorthodox.",
        "Daphne: Yeah. That's what I think.",
        "Daphne picks up the phone and calls Donny.",
        "Daphne: Donny, I've just put your mum's wedding dress on. A mini- skirt? It's obscene! You can see my... What? No, I took the green box. [laughs] No problem, then. Bye. [hangs up] I took the wrong dress. This is from his mother's third marriage in 1968 in Las Vegas.",
        "Daphne starts laughing along with Niles. Daphne bends down trying to control her laughter. Niles peers over her and down her bra without her noticing.",
        "Daphne: Can you believe people used to actually dress like this?",
        "Niles: I wish I had a picture of it for whenever I needed a laugh.",
        "[tries to follow her to her bedroom]",
        "Frasier: Niles!",
        "Niles walks back sighing in fantasy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Scene Four - The Antiques Roadshow. Martin and Frasier are hanging around the set. Martin is holding a rather ugly pewter clock consisting of a small round dial set in the middle of a hideous bear.",
        "Martin: This bear clock's been in the family for generations, I can't wait to see how much it's worth. Do you think they'll put a dollar figure on it?",
        "Frasier: Sounds about right.",
        "Martin: Very funny, but you know, your grandpa passed this down to me and someday, when I'm gone, it'll be passed on to you.",
        "Frasier: Dad, please, I don't even want to think about that day.",
        "Martin: You know, I've got to see if I can go and get this baby appraised.",
        "Martin goes off to the appraisers as Niles enters.",
        "Niles: I am so sorry, but on the way in I had the most amazing",
        "celebrity sighting: Hans Dietrich.",
        "Frasier: [thrilled] The loveseat expert?",
        "Niles: The very same. He's much smaller in person than on television. He's that big. [holds a hand up to the bottom of his neck]",
        "Frasier: Get out!",
        "Martin: Boys, come over here, they want to put me and the clock on TV.",
        "Frasier: Good Lord, we can't appear on TV with that hideous thing.",
        "Niles: Everyone we know watches this program.",
        "Frasier: Thank God he didn't bring along that dreadful mounted jackrabbit's head with the antelope horns.",
        "Niles: The Jackalope! Texas's answer to the Minotaur.",
        "Martin: So what do you think of that, boys? They said they've never seen anything like it.",
        "Frasier: Dad, you know, this could go either way.",
        "Martin: Oh, I know. I'm not going to act like one of those saps I make fun of. Doesn't matter if it's worth two dollars or two thousand, I'm just gonna say, \"That's pretty much what I figured.\"",
        "The director shouts that tape is rolling so Niles and Frasier back off out of view from the camera. The bear clock is on a table in front of the camera. Martin and the appraiser are standing around the table.",
        "Martin: [calls to boys] Guys, which one of you wants to come and hold this?",
        "Frasier: No, no, Dad. We wouldn't dream of it.",
        "Niles: This is your moment.",
        "Director: Everybody ready? Action.",
        "Appraiser: So, Martin, what can you tell us about this pewter clock?",
        "Martin: [playing to the camera] Well, it is a clock set in the stomach of what appears to be a bear.",
        "Appraiser: Actually, it's much more than that. It's Russian, made in the mid-nineteenth century.",
        "Martin: That's pretty much what I figured.",
        "Appraiser: Actually, it's a stunning piece. It was made by Andr\u00e9 Krogyn, who worked for Tsar Alexander II.",
        "Martin: That is pretty much what I figured.",
        "Appraiser: I don't know if you're descended from the Romanovs, Martin, but all of Krogyn's known bear clocks were done exclusively for the Romanov family and are now in the Hermitage Museum.",
        "By now, Niles and Frasier, baffled by the findings, have walked into camera view and are standing alongside Martin.",
        "Appraiser: Martin, you may be surprised to learn that this clock at auction would easily bring $25,000.",
        "Martin: [excited] Ca-ching!",
        "He laughs and claps his hands excitedly, but Frasier and Niles calm him into acting reserved again.",
        "Frasier: What he means is, that's pretty much what we figured.",
        "Frasier reaches out and strokes the bear clock like a favorite possession while he and Niles smile into the camera.",
        "End of Act One. Act Two.",
        "Scene One - Frasier's Apartment. Martin, Niles and Frasier enter the apartment with the bear clock in hand.",
        "Frasier: After you, Dad.",
        "Martin: Thank you.",
        "Frasier: So, you know, Dad? I've been thinking, we should find an appropriate place for this clock. How about right here on this console? [puts it on table behind sofa]",
        "Martin: Oh, I get it! It doesn't look quite so bad to you guys now that it's worth twenty-five grand. Oh, I could kick myself for not bringing that Jackalope!",
        "Martin exits to the kitchen as Niles and Frasier give a look at each other.",
        "Niles: What an amazing day, eh?",
        "Frasier: It certainly was. You know, Niles, I was meaning to ask you about something. Remember the appraiser said something about the bear being from Russia, dad being part of the Romanov family?",
        "Niles: Yeah, yeah, you know, that struck my ear too.",
        "Frasier: Yes, although I don't seriously believe there's any real chance of that.",
        "Niles: [half-heartedly] No, of course not.",
        "Frasier: [dragging it out] It's a long shot.",
        "Niles: It's possible.",
        "Frasier: Although we do have the bear.",
        "Niles: I know.",
        "Martin enters back from the kitchen.",
        "Frasier: Oh, Dad. Niles just reminded me of something I completely forgot. When the appraiser mentioned that the bear was from Russia...",
        "Martin: Oh, yeah. Well, it probably got passed down through your great-great grandmother. She was from Russia.",
        "Frasier: A-ha, he said something about the Romanov family?",
        "Martin: Oh, yeah, that, eh? Are you sure you want to hear about this?",
        "Niles: [no question] Yes, Dad.",
        "Martin: Well, I guess you would have found out anyway after I died... We're royalty.",
        "Frasier and Niles are ecstatic.",
        "Martin: But I didn't want you to grow up spoiled, so I abdicated and took a job in Seattle on the police force. [the brothers realize his joke] It was kinda hard giving up that royal way of life, but I think maybe it's the swans that I miss most.",
        "Frasier: Very funny, Dad. Point taken. Sherry, Niles? [crosses to sherry]",
        "Niles: Please.",
        "Martin: I'm sorry to disappoint you. I know you'd rather be anything else in the world except Cranes!",
        "Frasier: Dad! Now that is just not true, we are proud to be Cranes. It's just innocent curiosity.",
        "Martin: Well, I gotta go call Duke. But don't get excited, he's not a real Duke.",
        "Martin exits to his room as Frasier brings the sherries across to Niles.",
        "Niles: Well, we stepped in it that time.",
        "Frasier: Yes, what the hell is wrong with us? Asking whether we are related to the Romanovs. We just got past this whole Crane shame thing.",
        "Niles: We should have known it'd just upset him.",
        "Frasier: Yes, and for what? Trying to find some distant connection to royalty.",
        "Niles: Even if we can prove it, what do we have?",
        "Frasier: Huh, a story to tell at parties.",
        "Niles: An occasional seat at a state dinner.",
        "Frasier: Some meaningless title. It's insane.",
        "Niles: Ridiculous... destructive.",
        "Frasier: Still, there is this grandmother.",
        "Niles: I'm right behind you.",
        "Frasier: You know, Niles, given our new pride in the Crane name, perhaps it would behoove us to research our family tree.",
        "Niles: Actually, in a way we'd be honoring Dad.",
        "Frasier: Yes, of course we wouldn't need to tell him.",
        "Niles: No.",
        "Frasier: Just a few hours on the internet, a trip to the library, we could sketch in the entire family tree.",
        "Niles: And if there should happen to be a connection [breathless with glee] to the Romanovs...",
        "Frasier: Well, what harm is there in that?",
        "[N.B. Famous last words.]",
        "Frasier: It is amusing to contemplate, isn't it, Niles? You, me, Dad - all part of an ancient noble family.",
        "Martin then bursts out his room holding the jackalope to his forehead and chasing Eddie into the kitchen, showing off the true noble spirit of the Crane family.",
        "Martin: Okay Eddie, the jackalope's gonna get ya! The jackalope is gonna get ya!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Scene Two - Caf\u00e9 Nervosa. Frasier is surfing the internet and tracing his family tree at the window seat as Roz enters wearing a red dress with a silk shawl.",
        "Roz: Hey, Frasier. How's the research going?",
        "Frasier: Oh, sit down, Roz. I'll bring you up to speed.",
        "Roz: No, thank you. [sits on another table] I'm meeting someone.",
        "Frasier: Good God! Not one of your internet dalliances?",
        "Roz: It's just coffee, okay? Listen, this guy's totally legit, he e-mailed me his picture. [holds it up]",
        "Frasier: A picture? Oh, for God's sakes, Roz, what can you learn from a picture? The man's probably a lunatic, a psychopath... [looks at picture] Oh, he's a pretty boy.",
        "Roz: Yeah.",
        "Frasier: Wait... I know this photo. It's the cover of this month's Bidwell's catalogue!",
        "Roz: Are you sure?",
        "Frasier: I'm positive, I ordered those socks and driving shoes!",
        "Roz: How could someone do this?",
        "Frasier: Well, it's probably some insecure would-be Romeo trying to lure you into a meeting.",
        "And then, as if in response to his description, in pops Noel.",
        "Noel: Hello, Frasier.",
        "Frasier: Noel.",
        "Noel: [to Roz] What have we here? An empty seat next to yours. May I?",
        "Roz: No! Of all the dumbass things you've done to get me to go out with you, e-mailing me this picture is just the most moronic!",
        "Noel: But, Roz-!",
        "Roz: Forget it, buddy!",
        "The man in Roz's photo enters Nervosa and watches the scene, as Roz backs Noel into the counter, hitting him with the picture.",
        "Roz: I ought to take your mouse cord and wrap it around your nerdy little neck until your eyes pop out like champagne corks!",
        "Noel: [looks at picture] But I didn't send you this.",
        "Roz: Yeah right, then who did?",
        "Noel: My guess would be... [points to man] that guy.",
        "Roz turns and gasps. The man leaves, disappointed with her.",
        "Roz: Oh my God! Oh, Noel, I'm so sorry. [gathers her things]",
        "Noel: How sorry?",
        "Roz: Not that sorry.",
        "Roz exits chasing after her date as Niles enters.",
        "Niles: I just saw the Bidwell's guy!",
        "Frasier: Yes. [Niles sits] Well Niles, how goes the research?",
        "Niles: Oh, I think you're going to be very pleased. According to this catalogue of Russian antiquities, the bear clock was last seen in Moscow in 1879.",
        "Frasier: Well, hold on to your fur hat, Niles. I just discovered that our great-great grandmother emigrated from Russia... 1879!",
        "Niles: My God, it's all coming together. I can practically picture the scene.",
        "Frasier: Yes.",
        "Niles: Our great-great grandmother, smelling revolution in the wind...",
        "Frasier: Secretly slips away in the black Russian night...",
        "Niles: Taking the bear clock with her to remind her of better days.",
        "Frasier: Yes! The ticking hands of time counting down her return, her royal power merely hibernating. [Frasier's mobile sounds, he answers] Yes? Yes, yes, I'll hold.",
        "Niles: Who is it?",
        "Frasier: It's Dr. Myshkin. He's an attach\u00e9 at the Russian embassy, also an expert on the Romanovs. [to phone] Yes, Dr. Myshkin. This evening would be fine. About seven \u00f3 clock. Yes, I live in the Elliot Bay Towers. I'll see you then. [hangs up] He has some important information for us. My God, Niles, this is it. The final link to our royal past. I'm going to issue a press release!",
        "Niles: Not before I shout it from the rooftops! [notices Martin entering] Here's Dad, hide everything!",
        "They quickly clean things off the table and shut the laptop as Martin enters.",
