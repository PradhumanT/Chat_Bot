    "Recap": [
        "Christmas is approaching, and everyone is in a festive mood. Roz is working at the Mall as \"Snowflake\", one of Santa's elves, and actually has her eye on Santa ( Dean Cain ) himself, even though she has yet to see him without the costume. Meanwhile, having dispatched Mrs. Moon on a cruise , Niles and Daphne invite Frasier and Martin to their place for Christmas. However, Frasier had already been making extensive plans for a family celebration at his apartment, and this leads to an argument between the brothers. Martin eventually loses patience with them and decides to work over Christmas. Hating the idea of spending Christmas without their father, Frasier and Niles apologize and organise a surprise for him, but not everything goes according to plan. A mix-up with the presents and a last-minute schedule change leaves the entire family locked out of the building where Martin works, staring in at the presents Frasier and Niles put around its Christmas tree."

        "[Act 1]",
        "[Scene 1 - Caf\u00e9 Nervosa Fade in. Frasier enters and sees Roz seated at a table next to the counter. There is a waiter at the table with reindeer antlers on his head.]",
        "Frasier: Oh, hey Roz. Can I join you?",
        "Roz: Sure.",
        "Frasier: [to waiter] Ah... May I have a latt\u00e9 to go, please? And I... I hope that they're paying you extra to wear that.",
        "[He takes the seat across from Roz.]",
        "Waiter: No, but I was hoping that it would help me with my tips.",
        "Frasier: Ah. Well, as you know my tipping policy stands firmly on the twin pillars of courtesy and efficiency. But today I shall include - [tips him] - whimsy. Merry Christmas.",
        "Waiter: God Bless You, sir.",
        "Frasier: Well... [The Waiter leaves.]",
        "Roz: I'm really surprised Frasier, I didn't think you'd go for something kitschy like that.",
        "Frasier: It's Christmas time I say let a thousand antlers bloom.",
        "Roz: Oh, well what a relief.",
        "[She takes off her coat to reveal an elf costume.]",
        "Frasier: Oh... oh, Roz.",
        "Roz: I'm working Santa's Toy Drive at the mall. I'm an elf.",
        "Frasier: Roz, if you needed extra cash you should have come to me. I've got plenty of odd chores around the house.",
        "Roz: [looks disgusted] It's not about money. I'm volunteering.",
        "Frasier: Oh! Well, good for you, yes.",
        "Roz: Yeah, visiting Santa Claus at the department store was one of my favorite memories as a kid.",
        "Frasier: Mmmm... I always found him terrifying - and inquisitorial.",
        "Roz: When I was seven - my mom and dad took me to the mall to see Santa...",
        "Frasier: Uh-huh.",
        "Roz: [continuing] They were going through their divorce at the time so they were barely talking. Anyway, when I sat down on his lap - I started to cry and he was just so nice, he made me feel safe and protected... I don't know, he just made me feel special. So if I can do that for just one little kid - you know? I'd like to do that. [She nods]",
        "Frasier: I'm sorry I laughed at you, Roz. You should be very proud of yourself.",
        "Roz: Thank you, and I better go before I'm late.",
        "[She gets up from her chair]",
        "Frasier: Oh, right. You know what, I'm going too, I'll walk with you.",
        "[He gets up from his chair as Roz picks up her coat from the back of her chair. As she passes Frasier, who is now at the counter, the bells on her costume jingle. He turns to see her at the door putting an elf hat on her head.]",
        "Frasier: Actually Roz, [She looks up] why don't you go ahead? I'm going to get myself a scone.",
        "[Roz leaves and Frasier turns back towards the counter as we fade out.]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Scene 2: Frasier's apartment. Frasier answers the door to Niles and Daphne. Martin is in his chair.]",
        "Daphne: Hello!",
        "Niles: Hello, Hello.",
        "Frasier: Oh, hi guys. Good to see you.",
        "[As they enter Frasier kisses Daphne on the cheek. Daphne goes into the living room, while Niles starts talking to Frasier.]",
        "Frasier: Come on in.",
        "Niles: Hey! Ah, we were hoping to uh, use your wassail bowl.",
        "[Frasier closes the door.]",
        "Frasier: Oh, I'm sorry. I've already loaned it to Lawrence Emerson and his mandrel-caroling group.",
        "Niles: Well you can kiss that bowl good-bye. Frasier, the Yule Tones are the bad boys of Renaissance Christmas music. Have you ever seen a church common room after one of their performances?",
        "Frasier: Oh...",
        "Martin: Why don't you just use the punch bowl?",
        "Frasier: Because then it wouldn't be wassail, it would be punch.",
        "Martin: What's the difference?",
        "[Niles makes noise in the background.]",
        "Daphne: Me dad used to say that punch would make you want to kiss the donkey in the manger scene and wassail makes you want to check into the inn.",
        "Frasier: That's very funny. [walks over toward her] Uh, listen Daphne, uh, I was just wondering, is your mum partial to a traditional Cornwell dressing? You see, I'm thinking it'd go splendidly with the 12-lb. Hungarian goose that I'm serving.",
        "[Martin gets up from his chair.]",
        "Daphne: [laughs and walks over to Niles] Mum is spending Christmas on a cruise, an early Christmas present from Niles.",
        "Niles: Yes, I didn't think she'd go for it, but apparently in international waters you can play single deck Black Jack.",
        "Frasier: Oh...",
        "Niles: Um, actually Frasier, Daphne and I... would like to have you over at OUR house for Christmas this year.",
        "Daphne: Yeah, we just put up our tree and everything looks so lovely and it is our first Christmas as a married couple.",
        "Frasier: Well, uh, as lovely as that sounds--",
        "Niles: [interrupting] Oh, come on, why not?!",
        "Frasier: Uh, well, Niles because it's a little late to be changing things, isn't it? Besides, we've always had Christmas here, it's a tradition.",
        "[Martin is standing by the desk wearing glasses and holding an open dictionary.]",
        "Martin: \"Wassail - a Christmas punch.\"",
        "[Martin closes the dictionary and places it back on the desk.]",
        "Niles: Frasier, you've had Christmas for the past nine years.",
        "Frasier: Yes, but we agreed that when you hosted Thanksgiving, that we would have Christmas here in its traditional setting.",
        "[Daphne starts to say something, but doesn't.]",
        "Niles: Well maybe it's time to start a new tradition.",
        "Frasier: But I've had new stockings loomed for everyone - now there, you see, you've made me spoil the surprise - and did anyone hear that I have ordered a Hungarian goose?!",
        "[Martin sits back in his chair.]",
        "Niles: Which you are more than welcome to bring to our place.",
        "Frasier: [shouting] It's not my date, it's dinner!",
        "[Niles looks irritated.]",
        "Frasier: [continued] Honestly Niles, I'm really quite affronted by this.",
        "[Walks over to the dinner table and sits down in a chair.]",
        "Daphne: [turns to Niles and whispers] If it means that much to him, why don't we just let him keep it?",
        "Niles: [holding her wrist as she sits down on the couch and then lets go] No, No! [walks over to Martin's chair] There is no reason why just this once we can't host Christmas at the Montana. Frasier's just being a churl.",
        "Frasier: You're the churl!",
        "Martin: [aggravated] You're both a couple of churls. How 'bout a compromise? Say... morning at one house, afternoon at the other.",
        "Daphne: Well, that's a wonderful idea... but who gets morning and who gets afternoon?",
        "[Frasier jumps out of the chair that he is sitting in.]",
        "& Niles: [both raise a hand] Morning!",
        "Daphne: [gets up from couch] I think Niles said it first.",
        "[Niles turns to Frasier and goes \"Ha!\" Frasier just gasps.]",
        "Frasier: Dad, who do you think said it first?",
        "Martin: I'm sick of everything being a contest between the two of you.",
        "Frasier: Alright then dad, you decide where we're having Christmas.",
        "Niles: I'm fine with that.",
        "[Daphne sits back down.]",
        "Martin: Alright... I will. I need a few days to think about it...",
        "[Niles quickly turns his head, like \"great.\"]",
        "Martin: [continues] In the meantime, decision-making is thirsty work, sure could use a beer.",
        "Niles: [runs towards the kitchen] Oh! I'll get it!",
        "Frasier: [runs after him] NO!!",
        "Niles: I got it!",
        "Frasier: Oh, will you shut up!",
        "[They both exit into the kitchen.]",
        "Martin: [turns to Daphne] A little trick their mom taught me.",
        "[We fade out]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Scene 3 - The mall. We see Santa and a line of kids in front of him Roz is sitting down in front of him in her elf costume.]",
        "Santa: Don't worry Margie, you don't need a chimney. Santa always finds a way in. You have a Merry Christmas now.",
        "Margie: Thank you Santa.",
        "Santa: Ho, Ho, Ho.",
        "[Roz helps the little girl get down. Frasier enters from the side with a bag.]",
        "Frasier: Roz! Hello.",
        "[Roz walks over to him.]",
        "Roz: Oh! Hi, Frasier, listen, when I'm at the North Pole my name is Snowflake.",
        "Frasier: It's a little on the nose, isn't it?",
        "[They both laugh.]",
        "Frasier: Anyway, I was at the mall and thought that I'd drop off a donation for the Toy Drive.",
        "[He hands Roz a present from his bag.]",
        "Roz: Thank you very much.",
        "[She places the present with the others she turns back to Frasier and notices another gift in his bag.]",
        "Roz: Is this for us too?",
        "Frasier: No, no, actually this is another \"Dancing Santa\" for dad. His other one got damaged.",
        "Roz: I thought you threw that thing over the balcony?",
        "Frasier: Yes, which damaged it.",
        "[A girl dressed in an elf costume walks over to them.]",
        "Santa: Ho, Ho, Ho. Well Polly, what would you like Santa to bring you?",
        "Girl Elf: He wouldn't have to bring me anything, just show up.",
        "Roz: Back off Twinkle, I saw him first.",
        "[Twinkle walks away.]",
        "Frasier: What's this? Do I sense a little office romance... here at Santa's Workshop?",
        "Roz: Oh, I wouldn't mind. His name is Rick and he's so... sweet.",
        "Frasier: And let me guess, he's also a hunk?",
        "Roz: Well I wouldn't know, I haven't seen him without his Santa getup yet. But based on those eyes, [looks at Rick, then turns back to Frasier] there's definite potential.",
        "[Twinkle returns with gifts and places them with the others.]",
        "Santa: Oh, Ho, Ho. Santa needs his favorite helper elf.",
        "Roz: Oh, see that, I'm his favorite. [laughs]",
        "Twinkle: Down Snowflake, I've got this one.",
        "Roz: Okay Twinkle, you go ahead. [then, gasps] Oh, no, is that a zit?",
        "[As Roz rolls her eyes then leaves, Frasier drops his mouth open, while Twinkle puts her hand to her face and glances up at Frasier.]",
        "[We fade out]",
        "[Scene 4 - Caf\u00e9 Nervosa. Frasier is sitting at the table next to the entrance. Roz enters with her costume in a garment bag.]",
        "Frasier: Oh, Snowflake. Over here.",
        "[Roz joins him.]",
        "Roz: Hi. I just got back from the costume shop, I had to get my toes re-curled. [Places her bag across her chair]",
        "Frasier: Ah, which reminds me. How are things with Mr. Claus, mm?",
        "Roz: Oh, I haven't had a chance to ask him out yet.",
        "Frasier: What's the matter? Low... elf-esteem?",
        "Roz: How long have you been waiting to say that?",
        "Frasier: Two days. I almost called you. [both laugh]",
        "[Martin enters and Frasier notices Niles sitting over by the counter. Martin goes over to Niles, who is dusting off his chair.]",
        "Frasier: What's this? Niles with dad. I knew it!",
        "Roz: Oh! You guys aren't still fighting about -- Christmas?",
        "Frasier: He's fighting. I'm not fighting.",
        "Roz: Oh, what is the big deal? Why don't you let him have Christmas?",
        "Frasier: Because it is just so unfair.",
        "Roz: What's not fair?",
        "Frasier: Oh, you wouldn't understand.",
        "Roz: Well come on Frasier, talk to me. Use your words.",
        "Frasier: Because, it's so egregious.",
        "Roz: Smaller words.",
        "Frasier: I don't know. Okay, look, it just seems that Niles is systematically emptying my home. We used to have Thanksgiving dinner there... gone! Daphne... gone! If I let him have Christmas, I'll have nothing left. Just end up some... doddering old bachelor sipping tea and keeping the apartment at a balmy seventy-eight degrees.",
        "Roz: And how is that different from now?",
        "[Frasier gives her a look when he spies Niles giving Martin a thermos with a bow on top, from a bag that is on the table.]",
        "Frasier: Excuse me. I smell skullduggery afoot.",
        "[He walks over to Martin and Niles.]",
        "Frasier: Hey, dad.",
        "Martin: Hey, Fras.",
        "Frasier: New thermos? Niles, I'd have never thought you'd stoop so low.",
        "Niles: I have no idea at what you're talking about. Just buying dad some coffee before driving him to work.",
        "Frasier: You are trying to bribe dad to have Christmas at your place!",
        "[Niles stands up.]",
        "Niles: Oh, and what about you? Buying him the Dancing Santa. A surprising gift, considering you threw his last one off the balcony!",
        "[Martin gasps and Frasier steps back.]",
        "Martin: You did what? That Santa never did anything to hurt you, all he ever did was dance and try to make people happy.",
        "Frasier: Yes, yes, alright dad.",
        "Martin: Why'd you do it--",
        "Frasier: Oh, alright!",
        "[N.B. Shouldn't Martin already know that Frasier threw his Dancing Santa off the balcony? Remember in the tag credits of Season Seven's \"The Fight Before Christmas,\" [7.11], Martin sees the hat on the balcony and looks down. He then turns around to see Frasier so he know that HE did it!]",
        "Niles: Why do you have to make everything so difficult?",
        "Frasier: Excuse me Niles, but I have news for you. Copernicus called and you are not the center of the universe!",
        "Martin: Alright, you two knock it off!",
        "Niles: Let's just settle this now. [whispering and motioning to Frasier] Sit down. Dad, make your decision.",
        "[Frasier sits down.]",
        "Martin: You know, I'm really disappointed in you guys. I thought that if I gave you a little time, you'd be mature enough to work this out on your own.",
        "Frasier: Well you were wrong!",
        "Martin: Alright, you know what? I just made my decision. I'm working Christmas. Jimmy Daily asked me to take his shift and I'm gonna do it because he'll be happier with his family than I am with mine.",
        "[Martin grabs his hat and new thermos and they all stand up.]",
        "Frasier: Oh, dad, you can't be serious?",
        "Martin: It's too late! [people start to look, walks towards door] And you don't have to drive me to work, I can call a cab. I hope you're happy! You've ruined Christmas!",
        "[Roz gives an \"uh-oh\" look, the cafe falls silent for a few seconds before people start shouting insults. Frasier turns back to Niles.]",
        "Waiter: [at counter] Not nice.",
        "[We fade out]",
        "[End of Act I]",
        "[Act II]",
        "[Scene 1 - Martin's Office. Niles and Frasier enter and Martin is at the desk.]",
        "Frasier: Dad, uh, Niles and I would like to apologize. It was untoward of us to... to argue of where to have Christmas.",
        "Niles: Our conduct was... was self-absorbed and boorish. Not that we deserve it, but please accept our apologies.",
        "Martin: Apologies accepted.",
        "Frasier: Uh, thank you dad. So you'll have Christmas with us?",
        "Martin: Oh, I'm afraid I can't. I promised Jimmy that I'd work, and I can't go back on it.",
        "[An elevator \"dings\" and an officer comes out.]",
        "Frasier: When do you start?",
        "Martin: Six A.M., twelve-hour shift. It's double time, so I'm not complaining.",
        "Niles: No, that's the whole day.",
        "[Martin shrugs his shoulders at them as his supervisor comes over to them.]",
        "Supervisor: Marty, I need you to let maintenance into the electrical closet on seven.",
        "Martin: Will do. See you boys later.",
        "[Martin leaves as the officer takes his place.]",
        "Frasier: Bye, dad.",
        "Niles: Wow. [sighs] Christmas without dad. This just won't be... Christmas.",
        "[As they talk the officer behind them eavesdrops on their conversation.]",
        "Frasier: I know. He's always the first one under the tree. Mom always said that he was the biggest kid, because he could never wait to open his presents.",
        "Niles: Ha, ha. [sighs] He always puts on a brave face, but I know he especially misses mom on Christmas.",
        "[Niles walks over to the door to leave, but Frasier stops him.]",
        "Frasier: Niles. Where is it written that we have to have Christmas at either of our homes?",
        "Niles: The Thanksgiving Accord of 2002.",
        "Frasier: No, no. What I am saying... is dad has to work. Why can't we bring the holiday to him?",
        "Niles: You mean just show up and surprise him? I like that. We can bring all our gifts and, and food.",
        "Frasier: Oh, better yet. What if the gifts were already here?",
        "Niles: But... [looks confused]",
        "Frasier: Okay, here's what I'm thinking.",
        "[They both walk over to the tree that is next to the door, looking down at the presents as they make their plan.]",
        "Frasier: We take the gifts that are here and put them under the tree at my house. Get the real gifts and bring them here, all unbeknownst to dad.",
        "Niles: Brilliant.",
        "Frasier: Can't you just see us casually stopping by on Christmas morning? \"Hello, dad. Merry Christmas, oh it's just a shame that you had to spend Chri- Hello? What's this I spy? A present for Martin?\"",
        "Niles: [imitating Martin] \"That's not for me, those are fake.\"",
        "Frasier: Well, here's another one. One for Niles. And one for Daphne.",
        "Niles: Oh, geez it's a miracle.",
        "Frasier: Oh, Niles. It'll be the best Christmas we've ever had!",
        "Niles: [looks at hand] Look I'm getting goose bumps!",
        "Frasier: [laughs then stops] Oh no, Niles that's your pine rash, you're too close to the tree.",
        "[As they leave Niles scratches his ear.]",
        "[Scene 2 - Cafe Nervosa. Roz and Daphne are sitting at a table. Rick is at the counter he turns around and notices Roz.]",
        "Rick: Hey! Hi, Roz.",
        "[Roz doesn't recognize him.]",
        "Rick: [continued] It, it's me, Rick.",
        "Roz: Oh my God, Rick, I didn't even recognize you.",
        "Rick: Ah, Roz and I volunteer down at the mall together.",
        "Roz: Rick plays Santa. Daphne, this is Rick - Rick, Daphne.",
        "Daphne: Oh, Roz has told me all about you. Would you like to join us?",
        "Rick: I'd love to, but I have to get back to my day job.",
        "Daphne: Oh, what do you do?",
        "Rick: I'm an investment banker. Could you excuse me for just one second?",
        "[He goes back to counter.]",
        "Daphne: Wow, Roz! You never told me he was so gorgeous.",
        "Roz: Oh, I've never seen him out of his costume, before.",
        "Daphne: He's successful and he's got great taste. Those shoes... Enrico Zangleones.",
        "[Roz looks surprised.]",
        "Daphne: [continued] Niles is teaching me.",
        "[Rick comes back with a to-go cup.]",
        "Rick: It's very nice meeting you, Daphne. [she smiles and nods] I'll see you tonight, Roz? Maybe we could take our break together. I stuck a bottle of schnapps in my locker.",
        "Roz: [doesn't seem excited] Yeah, maybe.",
        "Rick: Is something wrong? You don't like schnapps?",
        "Roz: No! No, it's just so strange to see you without your beard. You really should grow one. It would make your eyes twinkle.",
        "Rick: Eh, I tried once. Kinda came in... tough. I looked like a dog on Rogaine.",
        "[They all laugh. Rick's laugh is horrible.]",
        "Roz: What was that?",
        "Rick: I-I laughed.",
        "Roz: That's your laugh?",
        "Rick: Yeah.",
        "Roz: Wow, at the mall it's so booming.",
        "Rick: I--I know, I hate that. It really kills my throat. [turns to Daphne] Very nice to meet you.",
        "Daphne: Bye, Bye.",
        "Rick: [turns to Roz] I'll see you later.",
        "Roz: Bye.",
        "[He leaves.]",
        "Daphne: Why are you being so weird? He seems perfect. [glances out the window]",
        "Roz: I'd don't know, just wasn't what I was expecting. Something missing.",
        "Daphne: Like what?",
        "Roz: I don't know. Well, at the mall he has all this warmth and he's got this jolly sense of humor. Oh, you should see him when he laughs, his whole stomach shakes.",
        "Daphne: Oh, my God. You're in love with Santa Claus. [she giggles]",
        "Roz: [leans in] No, I'm not.",
        "Daphne: Well, it makes sense when you think about it. Santa's the perfect man. He's a good listener, he likes to travel, he gives great presents.",
        "[giggles again]",
        "Roz: Give me a break.",
        "Daphne: Admit it. You want the jelly belly. [giggles]",
        "Roz: Okay, don't be gross.",
        "[She grabs her purse from the floor and sets it on the table.]",
        "Daphne: You want to bang-boots with the big boy.",
        "[She laughs as Roz gets up from her chair and grabs her coat from it.]",
        "Roz: [puts her coat on] I have to get to work.",
        "Daphne: [gets up from chair] You want to get your paws on the Claus is more like it.",
        "[Daphne grabs her coat and purse]",
        "Roz: Stop it, Daphne! That's enough! [she exits]",

        "Frasier: Dad! [grabs coat from hook] What are you doing still sitting there? [walks over behind the couch] I told you ten minutes ago that we were going out for Christmas Eve ice cream.",

        "Frasier: Alright, what we need is a really good distraction. [thinks for a moment] I'll tell you what. Knock when you think of one.",

        "Frasier: No, you didn't.",
        "Niles: Yes, I did. I know, 'cause that's real and fake ones are in a pile by the door.",
        "Frasier: The elevator door?",

        "Niles: [he motions Frasier to place the presents under the tree] See, I told you, if you rearrange them they look fuller. [Makes it look like he was arranging them]",
        "Frasier: Yes, yes, I see what you mean, Niles. It's all a matter of perspective.",
        "Martin: Wow, it looks like twice as many. Uh, put them back the way they were and show me how you did that. [he motions with his finger]",
        "Daphne: [comes out of the kitchen] Got the Philips. Let's go.",
        "[She motions for them to \"move it along\" while Martin heads back to the bedroom.]",
        "Niles: He could be an assassin in those slippers.",
        "Daphne: Are you two going to switch the presents? Or are you going to argue about whose Christmas village is bigger? [she heads to the bedroom]",
        "Frasier: [gasps as Niles picks up a pile of \"real\" presents from under the tree] I knew it! You didn't compliment mine, because you have one too.",
        "Niles: [turns around with presents in hand] I didn't compliment yours, because yours is so poorly laid out!!",
        "Frasier: Alright, alright. We don't have time for this, now which ones are which?",
        "Niles: Oh, oh! I have them all organized. Here, take those out. [hands Frasier the pile of gifts and gets some for himself to take out]",
        "Frasier: Are you sure?",
        "Niles: Yes, absolutely. These-these are the real ones. These go to dad, out in the hall and we'll take them together. [both go to the hall]",
        "Frasier: Fine. alright, alright. [starts to mumble]",
        "Niles: Fine, then here. [sets gifts down in the hall] Now we're all set. [takes gifts from Frasier] All the fake ones are under the tree.",
        "Frasier: Yes, now you put those in the elevator. I'll tell Daphne the coast is clear.",
        "[Frasier shuts the door. Daphne comes out of the bedroom with Martin following, sounding sorrowful.]",
        "Daphne: Do you have any idea how much I paid for that?",
        "Martin: Well, it's not my fault. Those little plastic hinges snap off if you look at them.",
        "Daphne: Now what am I supposed to give as a gift, now?",
        "Martin: Oh, stop cryin'. Just put a little duct tape on it and it'll be good as new.",
        "Daphne: [shouting] It was new! [goes to kitchen]",

        "[Eddie is at the front door barking. Martin walks over to the coat rack.]",
        "Martin: What's the matter, boy? Too much eggnog, huh? [laughs] Okay. [yells to kitchen] Hey, Daph. Be sure and to use the silver duct tape, not the brown. The silver will match the camera- [goes over to the door] oop! - the present. I'm takin' Eddie for a walk.",
        "[Frasier runs out of kitchen to catch Martin.]",
        "Frasier: Wait, dad! I'll do that. You should just relax.",
        "Martin: No, that's alright. I need the fresh air. [opens door, we see Niles] Uh-oh. What's this, more presents? Is this why you were trying to keep me busy back there?",
        "Niles: [not sure of what to do] Yes.",
        "Martin: [laughs] Oh, ohh, why, you didn't need to do that. Bring 'em on in. Frasier, give your brother a hand.",
        "[Frasier goes into hall as Niles comes in with a pile of presents. They give each other looks.]",
        "Martin: [Frasier comes in with a pile] Mix them all up, so they'll look fuller.",
        "[Niles turns around at the tree to give Martin a look.]",
        "MERRY CHRISTMAS, STEVE!",

        "Niles: Hey. Hi.",
        "Frasier: Niles. So... how are you?",
        "Niles: Well, uh, tired and a little poorer. [Frasier sighs as he walks over to the coat rack] Had to bribe the maintenance man at dad's building to get him to stay late. Which reminds me, on your next show you have to give something called a Shout Out to a Steve Gomez. [he shrugs his shoulders]",
        "Frasier: [has coat in hand] Right. [walks to door]",
        "Daphne: [laughs] This is so exciting, I can't wait to see the look on your Father's face when we go over there and surprise him.",
        "[As they head out the door Martin comes out from the hall dressed in matching pj's and robe.]",

        "Frasier: Dad, uh, what are you doing here?",
        "Niles: [looks at his watch] Yes, aren't you supposed to be at work? [laughs slightly]",
        "Martin: [walks down the steps] Oh, the boss called, I don't have to go in. Seems he was feeling guilty about me missing Christmas with my family. [picks up a present] Ooh, heavy. This must be a good one, [walks over to his chair and sits down] unless it's a book.",
        "Daphne: But, who's covering the desk?",
        "Martin: Nobody, she's shut down tight 'til tomorrow. Now, I have just enough patience to wait for the cocoa before I start tearing into these.",
        "[The others look horribly sad.]",
        "Niles: Um... dad?",
        "Martin: [sad ] Don't tell me there's no cocoa.",

        "Daphne: [Frasier taps on the door, too] Hello? Hello?",
        "Niles: You'd think there'd be a custodian or someone in there.",
        "Martin: Nah, I knew it'd be a long shot. There won't be anyone in 'til tomorrow morning.",
        "Frasier: Sorry, dad.",
        "Martin: Oh, forget it. It was a really sweet gesture. Would have been terrific, but...",
        "[He places a hand each on Niles and Frasier's shoulders. Daphne turns and smiles.]",
        "Frasier: [looks up, then back down] You know, we could throw a brick through the glass, but they're all wrapped up under our tree. [they all smirk]",
        "[We fade out]",
        "End Credits: The family is sitting around the Christmas tree at the office. Martin hands Daphne a big red box, she lifts the lid and pulls out a pink robe, while Frasier, who is next to her opening a gift and finds the digital camera with duct tape on in. Someone passes Daphne, Niles and Frasier say \"hello\" and the camera pans up and we see a few more people pass. (It is the next morning) Martin gets up and takes off the robe that he has on and Niles looks at his watch. Martin then goes over to the front desk. The rest of the family stay and Niles picks up another gift."
