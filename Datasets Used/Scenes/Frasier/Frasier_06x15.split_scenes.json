    "Recap": [
        "Maris 's divorce lawyers have motioned to postpone the trial date for eight months, which will be ruinously expensive for Niles. Frasier recommends he find himself new lawyers, and Roz suggests an ex-boyfriend of hers, Donny Douglas . Donny is cheery, uncouth, and slobby, but aggressively deals with Maris' lawyers, who are cowed into submission. Donny is hired, and begins preparing the family for deposition . Maris' lawyers are claiming that Niles was in love with Daphne throughout the period that the marriage was breaking apart, and Frasier feels unable to lie under oath to deny it. As Niles prepares for the inevitability he may have to come clean to Daphne about his feelings for her, Donny discovers that Maris' family fortune was made from urinal cakes, rather than lumber as she had always claimed. To spare herself embarrassment, she agrees to a quick divorce to ensure Niles' silence. However, his happiness is quickly quashed upon discovering Daphne and Donny have started dating."

        "ACT ONE",
        "Scene One - Caf\u00e9 Nervosa Frasier gets his coffee from the counter person.",
        "Frasier: Thank you very much. He turns to Roz, who is sitting with some photos.",
        "Frasier: Well, Roz - oh! Baby pictures?",
        "Roz: Actually, these aren't the most flattering.",
        "Frasier: Oh, nonsense. Baby Alice couldn't possibly take a bad picture. [takes them and looks] Oh, well, that's just adorable, the silly little one with the jam all over her face.",
        "Roz: Well, actually that's not jam, Frasier. It's baby eczema.",
        "Frasier: Oh. Well, don't worry about that. That sort of thing is bound to clear up. [looks at next picture] Or spread.",
        "Roz: Just give them back!",
        "She snatches the photos. Niles comes in.",
        "Niles: Hello, all.",
        "Frasier: Niles.",
        "Niles: Ooh, baby pictures!",
        "Roz: Oh, I really don't want anyone to look at those!",
        "Niles: [looks anyway] Well, I don't know why not. Botticelli himself couldn't have painted a more perfect angel.",
        "Roz: Thank you, Niles! She is precious, isn't she?",
        "She gazes proudly at the photos. Niles throws a disgusted leer at Frasier, who mouths, \"I know.\"",
        "Frasier: Anyway, Niles, uh, how did things go with Maris's lawyers?",
        "Niles: [to waiter] Cappuccino, please. [sits down] Maris is determined to prolong my suffering. She's asked to postpone our court date another eight months.",
        "Frasier: Eight months?!",
        "Niles: Yes, last night I was in such a state I almost wished I had a piano to crawl under.",
        "Roz: What?",
        "Niles: Oh, uh, it's a habit I developed as a child to combat anxiety. There's something about the safe, dark, protective environment that seemed comforting to me.",
        "Frasier: Yes, the week before his first Little League trial, he practically lived under there.",
        "Roz: Well, we all did weird stuff when we were kids.",
        "She throws a concerned look at Frasier, who mouths, \"I know.\" The waiter brings Niles's coffee.",
        "Frasier: So, Niles, uh, how did your lawyers respond to this postponement request?",
        "Niles: Well, I can tell you they weren't very happy about it! They got on the phone, raised some hell, and got that postponement cut down to... seven months.",
        "Frasier: Niles, are you serious?! Do you think maybe it's time that you consider getting some new lawyers?",
        "Niles: Fire Harrison & Reed? They're the top firm in Seattle.",
        "Frasier: But they're bleeding you dry! Do you realize that they don't mind these postponements at all? You know the longer they draw this thing out, the more money they'll get paid.",
        "Roz: Oh, you know, I have the perfect person for you to call. My old boyfriend, Donny, he's a great lawyer!",
        "Niles: [snorts] No offense, Roz, but I highly doubt that your \"Donny\" is in the same league with Harrison & Reed.",
        "Roz: Don't be so sure. I mean, he's smart, he's tough, he doesn't take \"no\" for an answer - not that I ever tested that theory.",
        "Frasier: Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute, are we talking about Donny Douglas?",
        "Roz: Yes!",
        "Frasier: Oh my God, Niles, I've read about this guy! He's the one they call \"the Piranha,\" right?",
        "Roz: Yes, but that's partly because he has this night-grinding problem that makes his teeth really sharp and tiny.",
        "Frasier: Yes, well, anyway, Niles, I mean this guy just won a huge case. He might be just who you need.",
        "Niles: I appreciate your concern, but really my situation is not as dire as you're making it out to be.",
        "He opens his briefcase. Roz wrinkles her nose.",
        "Roz: What's that smell?",
        "Niles: What smell?",
        "Roz: The one coming out of your briefcase.",
        "Niles: Oh, I don't smell anything-",
        "Frasier turns the briefcase and looks in.",
        "Frasier: My God, is this your lunch? [pulls out] A baloney sandwich? [pulls out] And a fruit cocktail?! Oh, Niles. You see what these lawyers have reduced you to? Do you have any idea what they're having for lunch?",
        "Niles: I don't know. They don't itemize, they just bill me for the total.",
        "Roz and Frasier share a look.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "I GUESS YOU'D CALL THEM \"LEGAL BRIEFS\"",
        "Scene Two - Donny's Office Maria (Donny's secretary) shows Frasier and Niles in.",
        "Maria: Donny should be here any minute. Make yourselves comfortable.",
        "Niles: Thank you.",
        "Frasier: Thank you.",
        "Maria leaves.",
        "Niles: Frasier, you really don't have to stay.",
        "Frasier: Well, I didn't have to come at all. But if I hadn't, you never would have. Well, the office seems nice enough. Might have overdone it on the plants a little.",
        "Niles: Yes, it's excess like this that's destroying the plastic rainforest.",
        "Frasier: [warning] Niles...",
        "Niles reads the diploma on the wall.",
        "Niles: Oh, University of Las Vegas! No problem finding tassels for those mortar boards.",
        "Frasier: Will you stop being such a snob? Give this man a chance, for God's sake. And please, will you have a mint? I'm halfway across the room, all I can smell is baloney!",
        "Donny Douglas walks in. He's a short, stout man who nevertheless has a sort of \"lean and hungry\" look about him. His less-than- impressive stature is made less impressive still by the fact that he's dressed in sweaty gym clothes, having just returned from his workout.",
        "Donny: Whoa! Hey, how you doing? Donny Douglas. How are ya, who's who?",
        "Frasier: Mr. Douglas, I'm Frasier Crane-",
        "Donny: [shaking hands] You're Frasier Crane-",
        "Frasier: This is Niles Crane.",
        "Donny: [shaking Niles's] Oh, you're Niles Crane. Frasier Crane? You're Roz's buddy, aren't you?",
        "Frasier: Yes, yes.",
        "Donny: Oh, you got to do me a favor, O.K.? Tell Roz, finally I had my teeth capped. See?",
        "He spreads his lips with his fingers, showing his teeth in a way that gives credence to his nickname, \"the Piranha.\"",
        "Frasier: Oh yes, well, I'll tell her.",
        "Donny: Promise you won't forget?",
        "Frasier: Oh, not much danger of that.",
        "Donny: OK. Now I got to be in court in about, uh, twenty minutes, so sit down, let's get started.",
        "Frasier and Niles sit in armchairs in front of the desk. Donny removes his sweatshirt, leaving only a tank-top, and throws it in a corner.",
        "Niles: Well, as we discussed on the phone-",
        "Donny: Maria, I need my gray suit for court! [to Niles] Come on, come on, come on!",
        "As Niles speaks, Donny further distracts him by wiping his chest and armpits with a towel.",
        "Niles: Well, Maris is determined to exhaust my already-strained financial resources, and the real injustice-",
        "Donny: Yeah, and Maria, could you just cancel that four o'clock of mine? [takes off his socks and tosses them in the corner] And can you also put Joe Silva on my call sheet? [to Niles] I'm listening, I'm listening, come on, come on, come on!",
        "Niles: Yeah, well, Maris has no right to be angry with me-",
        "Maria comes in with a gray suit coat and a sandwich on a plate.",
        "Donny: Maria! You're the best, thank you so much, cool. [to Niles] What, what? Come on, come on, let's go! What?",
        "Niles: Uh... I'm sorry, I forgot what I was saying.",
        "Donny: Oh, don't worry, Maria has that effect on men all the time.",
        "Maria leaves the office, giving an \"oh, stop it!\" wave.",
        "Frasier: Niles, I think you were about to tell Mr. Douglas about Dr. Schenkman.",
        "Niles: Right. Well, uh, last year Maris and I were actually making progress in couples' therapy, when to my dismay I discovered that she and our therapist were-",
        "Donny: [mouth full] Oh, my God.",
        "Niles: That's right, they were-",
        "Donny: This is the best corned beef I have ever tasted. You've got to have a bite of this. Here. Come on, it's got spicy mustard!",
        "Niles: No, thanks.",
        "Donny: How about you?",
        "Frasier: Sorry, mustard allergy.",
        "As far as Niles is concerned, the interview is over. He gets up.",
        "Niles: Mr. Douglas, maybe we'll come back when you have more time.",
        "Donny: No, no, uh-uh! I got the gist. Your wife was doing your shrink, and now she's trying to bleed you with a long pre- trial. I get it. Who's her lawyer?",
        "Niles: Lockhart & Whalen.",
        "Donny: Maria, get me Lockhart! Or Whalen.",
        "Niles: Wait, wait, wait, you're calling them?",
        "Donny: Yeah. Listen, could we just cut through the formalities here?",
        "He pulls down his sweatpants, leaving only boxers underneath.",
        "Niles: Uh, OK.",
        "Donny: Niles, what you need is a guy like me representing you. What you're in here is a street fight, and you got to know who's covering your back. So, what I guarantee you is this:",
        "He wraps a towel around his waist, and then pulls his boxers down. As he makes the following points, he gestures with the hand holding them. They whip around, nearly hitting Frasier.",
        "Donny: You will never see me unprepared, you will never see me intimidated, and you will never, ever see me throw in the towel! You understand?",
        "Frasier: Let's certainly hope not.",
        "Donny looks at him blankly, then realizes the joke and laughs.",
        "Maria: [o.s.] I've got Geoff Whalen on Line One!",
        "Donny: OK, thank you!",
        "Niles: [to Frasier] May I have a word with you?",
        "Frasier: Yes.",
        "Donny puts on a headset phone.",
        "Donny: Whalen! Donny Douglas here, I'm calling about Niles Crane. Yeah...",
        "Niles pulls Frasier aside.",
        "Niles: I can't possibly let this man represent me. I'll be humiliated!",
        "Frasier: Niles, you have got to hear this man out. I'm sorry, this is exactly what you want in a lawyer, someone who's not afraid to show a little moxie!",
        "Niles: Oh, he's an inch away from showing us the Full Moxie!",
        "At the other side of the room:",
        "Donny: ...facing a counter-suit for deliberate infliction of pain and emotional distress. What, you don't think I can win? You call York & McFaddon. You see what those bastards had to pay for trying to pull this same crap on a client of mine!",
        "Frasier and Niles look at each other, surprised.",
        "Donny: Yeah, we're talking big numbers here, Whalen! You haven't seen so many zeroes lined up since Mr. Spock had a book signing! [covers the microphone] You got to hear this, come here, come here!",
        "They come over. Donny takes off the headset and hits Speakerphone.",
        "Whalen: [v.o.] Well, yes, of course it's important to be reasonable. Donny takes another bite of his sandwich and mimes Whalen shivering.",
        "Whalen: Um, I'm sure we can move a few things around and be ready for court by... next month?",
        "Frasier and Niles are amazed.",
        "Whalen: Mr. Douglas?",
        "Donny: Yeah?",
        "Whalen: Does this mean you're now representing Niles Crane?",
        "Donny looks at Niles, who gives him a thumbs-up. They shake hands.",
        "Donny: That's exactly what that means. And Whalen, I'll be in touch about a discovery schedule. [sarcastic] Have a nice day!",
        "He hangs up and makes a \"Ta-Da!\" gesture.",
        "Niles: Mr. Douglas, that was brilliant.",
        "Frasier: Yes. My goodness, almost makes me wish I was still married to Lilith!",
        "Donny: Now they're probably going to get rolling sometime this week with depositions. So, you know, pick a day, we'll get together, I will prepare you! But it's going to be very low-key, very casual, you know, over dinner, something like that.",
        "Maria comes in.",
        "Maria: You're due in court in ten minutes.",
        "Donny: O.K.",
        "Maria: And Donny?",
        "Donny: Yeah?",
        "Maria: [points to her cheek] Mustard.",
        "She leaves. Donny feels his cheek and finds a large spot of mustard.",
        "Donny: [laughs] Oh, oh, jeez, was that there the whole time? [Frasier and Niles shrug] That's so embarrassing!",
        "He lifts a corner of the towel to wipe his cheek. Niles and Frasier jerk their eyes away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "INHERIT THE LONG-WINDED",
        "Scene Three - Apartment Frasier is seated at the coffee table, Martin is in his armchair, Niles stands near him. Donny is also standing with some papers.",
        "Frasier: And indeed, I had high hopes for Niles and Maris, as is witnessed by my wedding toast, in which I combined my heartfelt sentiments with apt quotations from Shakespeare, jazz great Louis Armstrong, and the poet Catullus.",
        "Donny: [sarcastic] And so your answer would be, \"Yes, I attended their wedding.\" Once again, Frasier, could you try to keep your answers brief?",
        "Frasier: Well, I-",
        "Martin: Trust me, he did.",
        "Frasier: All right, all right. Look, I'll try to do better.",
        "Martin: I still don't understand why they're deposing Frasier before Niles.",
        "Donny: Oh, they like to question friends and family first so they can get as much \"information\" as they can to try and catch Niles out in a lie. Now, look, they're also going to allege that during the separation, Niles was wasteful with money.",
        "Niles: Wha...? She's calling ME wasteful?!",
        "Donny: Mmm-hmm.",
        "Niles: Do you recall what she used to do when one of our dogs needed a shampoo?",
        "Frasier: Yes, she'd fill the bathtub with Evian!",
        "Niles: Half the time she'd just get a new dog!",
        "Donny: Anyway, look, Frasier, they might ask you if you witnessed any examples of Niles throwing money around, and your answer would be...",
        "Frasier: [pauses, then] Yes.",
        "Donny: [exasperated] No, no, no! The answer is, \"not to the best of my recollection!\"",
        "Frasier: But I do recall! And I'll be under oath!",
        "Donny: Oh, please, not this again.",
        "Niles: As you've probably figured out, Frasier is a bit of a stickler when it comes to his ethics, and frankly I applaud him for it.",
        "Donny: Oh, great.",
        "Daphne comes out with a pot of coffee.",
        "Daphne: More coffee, anyone?",
        "Donny: No, thank you, Daphne. I think I'm just about done here. In fact, I've got a conference call back at the office. I'm just going to check to see if that's still happening. Frasier, why don't you see if there's any more questions in there we haven't done yet, all right?",
        "He picks up the cordless phone and goes to the window.",
        "Frasier: All right, uh... [looks through list] We've done those... Oh, here's one. [reads] \"Can you recall a specific incident when Maris lost her temper or behaved in a way you'd characterize as volatile or unstable?\"",
        "The four of them think about it, apparently lost in thought. Then they all burst out laughing at the obvious answer.",
        "Donny: [into phone] You're kidding! No, really, well, based on what? Oh, please.",
        "Niles: Something wrong?",
        "Donny: No, it's OK. [into phone] Yeah, no, thank you, thank you, Maria, no. [hangs up] Maris's lawyers, they kill me. I mean, all week long it's been one desperate ploy after another. This one, this is the best one yet! [laughs]",
        "Frasier: Well, what is it?",
        "Donny: Oh, now they're claiming \"alienation of affection.\"",
        "Martin: You're kidding me! After what she did?",
        "Donny: Yeah, believe it or not, now they're saying that during the marriage, Niles was in love with another woman.",
        "Daphne: Who?",
        "Donny: [casual] Oh, you.",
        "Daphne: Me?!",
        "Niles: [half happy, half surprised] Dear God!",
        "Daphne: That's absurd! [to Frasier] Have you ever heard anything so ridiculous?",
        "Frasier: Well... not to the best of my recollection.",
        "END OF ACT ONE",
        "ACT TWO",
        "Scene Four - Apartment Resume:",
        "Daphne: Why on earth would they think Dr. Crane's in love with me?",
        "Donny: Oh, something about a country club ball the two of you attended a few years back.",
        "Niles: This is all based on that?",
        "Donny: Yeah. You caused quite a stir on the dance floor, or something?",
        "Daphne: Yeah, we were just putting on a show for his snobby friends.",
        "Donny: You must have been very convincing, because they're going to subpoena you for deposition. Now, look, you know, we can just call their bluff right away. You can come tomorrow morning with Frasier.",
        "Daphne: Fine by me.",
        "Donny: OK, great. Now listen, Daphne, I'm gonna have to prepare you for this, 'cause lawyers, they can twist your words around. They get a judge to buy it, because of the pre-nup, Maris can really stick it to Niles. But I've got this conference call at the office-",
        "Daphne: I could come with you.",
        "Donny: Oh, great! We'll get it done in about an hour.",
        "Daphne: Just let me grab my coat. Don't you worry, Dr. Crane!",
        "Donny: Now, Frasier, I hope you realize they are going to ask you about this business too.",
        "Frasier: Me?",
        "Donny: Yes, but don't worry. This is one time when your compulsive truth-telling won't get us into any trouble. Bye.",
        "Martin: Bye.",
        "Daphne and Donny leave the apartment. His parting shot has comforted the Crane boys about as much as we'd expect.",
        "Niles: Well, that's it. It's over. It's over and I've lost. Maris has won. Maris always wins.",
        "Martin: Niles-",
        "Niles: Niles never wins! Niles always loses! That's why Niles lives at the \"Shangri-La\" and drives a hatchback!",
        "Martin: Niles, now get a grip! Maris's people are just fishing. We're the only one's who know how you feel about Daphne.",
        "Niles: Today! Tomorrow, everyone will know, including Daphne. And this is how she's going to find out. I wanted to whisper it to her over a candlelight dinner, not have it read back to her by a court stenographer!",
        "Martin: What are you talking about? Frasier's not going to tell!",
        "Niles: He's gonna be under oath! What if they ask him point blank?",
        "Martin: Well, he'll just say no. Right, Fras?",
        "Frasier is silent, unsure.",
        "Martin: [worried] Fras?",
        "Frasier: Well, it's not that simple! You heard what he said, I'll be under oath.",
        "Niles: Oh my God. I can't breathe. I can't breathe!",
        "He staggers, gaping like a landed fish. Frasier grabs his neck and bows him over.",
        "Frasier: Niles, here! Put your head between your legs! I'll get you some water!",
        "He rushes to the kitchen.",
        "Martin: Niles, you'll be all right. Just take a couple of deep breaths.",
        "Niles: If I could take deep breaths it would mean I could breathe!",
        "In the kitchen, Frasier fills a water glass. Martin comes in.",
        "Martin: You're really not going to go down there tomorrow and blow it for him, are you?",
        "Frasier: Dad, there is nothing more I'd like to do than to help my brother. But I would like to find a way to do it without violating my ethics!",
        "Martin: But Maris is responsible for this divorce! Niles's feelings for Daphne has nothing to do with it! Now, if you cover for Niles you won't be doing anything wrong.",
        "Frasier: Dad, we are talking about perjury! When is that ever acceptable?",
        "Martin: Oh, you want an example? Fine! Let's say, uh, what if there was a comet hurtling towards the earth-",
        "Frasier: Oh, for God's sake!",
        "Martin: And you were the only person who could save the earth, but the only way to do it is by lying under oath. Would you do it then?",
        "Frasier: Who am I lying to, the comet?",
        "Martin: Oh, just answer the question!",
        "Frasier: All right, I suppose in certain extreme cases-",
        "Martin: So, then you'd lie?",
        "Frasier: To save mankind from a talking comet, yes!",
        "Martin: But you won't lie for Niles.",
        "Frasier: Oh, for God's sake, you make me sound like some sort of insensitive lout who's not aware that his brother's out there in pain! [takes a sip from the glass]",
        "Martin: Isn't that Niles's water?",
        "Frasier: I'm just checking to see it's not too cold!",
        "They come out. Niles has disappeared.",
        "Frasier: Niles? Niles?",
        "Niles: I'm over here.",
        "He is sitting in a crouch under the piano.",
        "Frasier: The piano, Niles! Please, please, just come out from under there. Things are not that bad.",
        "Niles: Not that bad? Daphne is going to find out about this!",
        "Martin: Not if you crawl out before she gets home.",
        "Niles's look says that Martin's joke isn't funny.",
        "Frasier: Niles, please, come out here. Now, come on.",
        "Niles: Why should I? There's nothing for me out there. It's all lawyers and ex-wives and broken hearts. All I have to contend with under here is a couple of dust bunnies... some cobwebs... some kind of a nest. Dear God, doesn't your vacuum come with any attachments?",
        "Martin: Oh, all right. Just sit tight and I'll get you a wet cloth. [to Frasier] Well, look what you've done, I hope you're happy now!",
        "Frasier: Well, do you really want to see me lying under oath?!",
        "Martin: Well, it's better than seeing your brother lying under a piano!",
        "Frasier follows Martin in to the kitchen. Martin wets a cloth in the sink.",
        "Frasier: You know, I can't believe you're being so casual about this! Do you realize you're asking me to do something completely unethical?!",
        "Martin: Oh, for God's sake, nobody's even going to know!",
        "Frasier: Yes, but that's the point! Ethics are what we do when no one else is looking! For heaven's sake, I learned that from you! Are you saying you wouldn't have any trouble with this?",
        "Martin: Niles? Here. [throws him the cloth]",

        "Martin: [to Frasier] Let me tell you something. One time when I was on the force, I saw a guy shoot somebody. When we caught him, I started to read him his rights, but he slipped out of his cuffs and he swung at me so I didn't get a chance to finish. Two months later, I'm on the stand, and his lawyer asks me if I'd read his rights in full. Now, if I say no this guy walks, and this guy has been in and out of jail all his life, he could have read ME his rights! So I say, \"yes, I did. I read them in full.\" I lied under oath. Now you might think that I did an unethical thing but there's not a doubt in my mind that I did the right thing.",

        "Frasier: [firmly] Listen to me: the only reason that marriage lasted as long as it did was because of the effort that YOU put into it. From the moment that you slipped that ring onto her bony little finger and it slipped right off again! There is no way that this divorce is your fault.",
        "Niles: I wish I could be sure of that.",

        "Roz is showing Frasier pictures as Niles enters to reports that Maris's lawyers are trying to prolong his torture by putting off the court date by another 8 months. Frasier asks how Niles's lawyers responded, and Niles says they got it cut down to 7 months. Frasier says it's time to consider a new lawyer, and Roz suggests her old boyfriend, Donny Douglas. Frasier is enthused -- \"He's the one they call The Piranha, right?\" Frasier's argument is proven when he discovers that Niles is now packing his own lunch, while the lawyers are putting their lunches on Niles's legal bill.",
        "SCENE 2 - Donny Douglas's office",
        "Frasier and Niles show up at Donny's office. Niles is full of snobbery over the office decor, Donny's degree from a less than prestigious law school, etc. Donny comes in wearing sweats, fresh from a workout. He's in a rush and is due in court in 20 minutes. He encourages Niles to tell him the facts of the divorce, but as Niles attempts to do so, Donny begins to take off his clothes to change for court. Niles tries to continue but is understandably distracted by Donny's eating his lunch, taking his clothes off, etc. Niles is ready to walk out when Donny decided to get on the phone with Niles' lawyers, and in short order browbeats them into setting a court date one month away. Very impressed, Niles agrees that Donny should represent him. As they depart Donny tells them he will contact them soon to prepare them for pre-trial depositions, just a casual dinner or something to discuss the questions that will be asked.",
        "SCENE 3 - Frasier's living room",
        "Donny, Frasier, Niles, Martin and Daphne are having coffee and discussing the testimony Frasier will give in his deposition the next morning. [Frasier has great difficulty being brief, as we all know.] Martin asks why Maris's lawyers want to depose Frasier before Niles, and Donny explains that they will want to find out as much dirt as possible from the friends and family before taking Niles' deposition, so they know what questions to ask Niles.",
        "Donny continues to go over the questions Maris's lawyers will ask Frasier. He asks whether Frasier ever noticed Niles throwing money around during the separation. Frasier says yes, and Donny corrects him. \"No, no! Your answer will be, 'Not to the best of my recollection.'\" Frasier protests that he can't give that answer because it's untruthful and a violation of his ethics, and Niles agrees with him. Donny is exasperated and goes to the phone to check with his office for messages. To his disgust he learns from his secretary that Maris's lawyers are making yet another desperate, outlandish accusation -- alienation of affection. Maris is alleging that Niles was in love with Daphne during the marriage.",
        "Niles is shocked but looks almost happy to hear the secret out at last. Daphne is completely disgusted at the low-down lawyer tactics and asks Frasier, \"Have you ever heard anything so ridiculous?\" Frasier replies uncomfortably, \"Not to the best of my recollection!\"",

        "SCENE 1 - Frasier's living room - continuation of previous scene",
        "Daphne asks why Maris's lawyers have such a ridiculous idea about her and Niles. Donny replies that she and Niles had apparently caused quite a stir at a country club dance a few years back. Daphne protests that it was all for the benefit of Niles' snobby friends, but Donny tells her the lawyers will subpoena Daphne to give a deposition about it anyway. Daphne replies bravely that she is ready, and in fact will give her deposition the next morning right after Frasier. \"Don't you worry, Dr. Crane!\" she tells Niles stoutly. She departs with Donny to his office, where he will prepare her for the questions she will be asked. After their departure Niles is distraught because he believes he has just lost the divorce case.",

        "Niles: \"Today! Tomorrow everyone will know, including Daphne. And this is how she's going to find out. I wanted to whisper it to her over a candlelight dinner, not have it read back to her by a court stenographer.\"",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "But Frasier can't give Martin the answer he wants, and the two get into a bitter argument over Frasier's ethics versus his loyalty to his brother. Martin argues the divorce was due to Maris's behavior, not Niles' feelings for Daphne which have nothing to do with the case. But Frasier argues that, \"Ethics are what we do when no one else is looking. I learned that from you!\" Meanwhile, Niles regresses to his childhood and retreats under the piano to hide.",
        "SCENE 2 - Donny's office - the next morning",
        "Frasier is waiting tensely to be called for his deposition when Niles unexpectedly shows up. He tells Frasier he plans to admit everything to Donny, and in fact is having doubts that perhaps his feelings for Daphne did contribute to the breakup of the marriage. Frasier sternly reminds Niles that he did everything he could to save the marriage and has nothing to reproach himself for. Niles is grateful for the reassurance and as Donny comes in, Frasier departs to the conference room for his deposition.",
        "Donny says he's glad to see Niles alone for a moment, because he has discovered Niles has been less than truthful with him. Niles apologizes and is about to admit the truth about Daphne when Donny reveals that the new information he's discovered is not about Daphne. It seems that Maris's family money didn't come from the sale of timber, as she's told Niles and everyone else in Seattle society.",
        "Baffled, Niles takes the file Donny hands him and reads with growing delight. \"Urinal cakes?\" he marvels. A smiling Donny replies, \"I believe we now have what's known as a bargaining chip.\" Donny starts out of the office to reveal the new information to Maris's lawyers, but Niles stops him. \"There's some news you want to deliver yourself!\" Making himself comfortable in Donny's desk chair and propping his feet on the desk, Niles gloats as he dials Maris.",
        "SCENE 3 - Cafe Nervosa - later that day",
        "Niles and Frasier enter the cafe, Niles elated over the large settlement he's gotten from Maris. \"I'll be able to get my whole life back -- my apartment, my car.... And to think I owe it all to one amazing man.\" Niles continues to rhapsodize about Donny as, behind his back, Donny and Daphne enter the cafe. They sit down at a table very obviously affectionate with each other. A downhearted Frasier points this out to Niles, who abruptly falls silent as they move to the window table to greet Daphne and Donny. Daphne tells Niles, \"Oh, Dr. Crane, I'm so happy for you.\" Niles puts on a cheerful face as Donny and Daphne reveal that they're dating. They seem genuinely happy with one another.",
        "Donny is obviously infatuated as he leans and sniffs Daphne's hair. \"Mmm, that scent is wonderful. What is that?\" As Niles turns away he answers quietly to Frasier, \"Cherry bark and almonds.\" The brothers return to their table and Niles sinks sadly into his chair with Frasier's hand on his shoulder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Frasier is seated at the dining table reading a book. He gets up to pour himself a glass of sherry and pours a second one as well, which he hands to Niles who is under the piano again."

Two months later, I'm on the stand, and his lawyer asks me if I'd read his rights in full. Now, if I say no this guy walks, and this guy has been in and out of jail all his life, he could have read ME his rights! So I say, \"yes, I did. I read them in full.\" I lied under oath.
