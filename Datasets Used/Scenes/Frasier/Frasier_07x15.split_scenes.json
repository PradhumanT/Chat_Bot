        "It is Valentine's Day . Niles cancels a night out with Frasier at the opera to be with his girlfriend Mel. Frasier persuades Martin to go instead, and at the opera they meet Emily ( Marg Helgenberger ) and her mother Helen ( Mary Louise Wilson ), during intermission. Helen tries to ask Martin out on a date, but tells her he is gay to let her down gently. That evening, Emily brings her gay uncle, Edward ( Brian Bedford ), to Frasier's apartment, hoping to set him up with Martin. When Martin realises, he pretends that he and Niles are an item."

        "Act One.",
        "Scene One - Frasier's Apartment. Martin enters the apartment with Eddie. Daphne is on the sofa with some video tapes. Roz enters from the kitchen with a tray of wine.",
        "Roz: Hey, Martin. Happy Valentine's Day.",
        "Martin: Oh thanks, Roz. So you're with us tonight, huh?",
        "Roz: Yeah, we rented a couple of sad chick movies.",
        "Martin: Oh, it's not like you not to have a date on Valentine's Day.",
        "Roz: Tell me, I usually try for a second seating! [Martin laughs]",
        "Daphne: And you'd think that being engaged, I'd have a guaranteed date. But no! Donny had to go to Florida, his grandmother. She'd do anything to come between us.",
        "Martin: Oh, what did she do this time?",
        "Daphne: She died.",
        "Frasier enters in his suit.",
        "Frasier: Good Lord, where is Niles? I don't want to be late for the opera.",
        "Roz: Are you going out with Niles on Valentine's Day?",
        "Frasier: Well, it's a subscription series, you see. We got these tickets months ago, we had no idea what day this fell on.",
        "Daphne: [hopeful] So Dr. Crane's not spending tonight with Mel?",
        "Frasier: No, she's going out of town, some sort of medical conference. [doorbell sounds] You know, actually I'm sorry for Niles, but I'm rather glad to be having an old-fashioned boy's night out.",
        "Frasier opens the door to Niles on his cell phone.",
        "Niles: [into phone] I can't wait either, I'll see you in twenty minutes, Valentine. [kisses into phone and hangs up]",
        "Frasier: That had better be the seat duster in our opera box!",
        "Niles: No, it was Mel. At the last minute she decided to skip her conference.",
        "Frasier: So, I'll be going to the opera by myself?",
        "Niles: Oh, well here's a thought. If you give Mel your opera ticket then you won't have to be alone. You can stay here and watch fun movies with Roz and Daphne. [looks at titles] Ooh, \"Dying Young\" - it's a... classic.",
        "Frasier: I am surprised by your gall! At the last moment you not only bail on me, you expect me to give up my own ticket!",
        "Niles: Please, Frasier, put yourself in my shoes. I have to do something for Mel. Every restaurant in town's been booked for weeks. I ran into Archie Wilfong today. He told me he had to settle for two seats at the counter at \"The Salad Experience!\" What would you suggest I do?",
        "Frasier: Bring your own wine and order the Spicy Caesar!",
        "Niles: [stalks to the door] May your opera box be full of cellophane crinklers and the stage swarming with standbys.",
        "Frasier: Get out!",
        "Niles leaves, slamming the door.",
        "Frasier: He goes too far!",
        "Roz: [sarcastic] Yeah, some nerve - ditching you to spend Valentine's Day with his girlfriend.",
        "Martin: Look, Fras, I don't blame you for being a little jealous cause he's got someone and you don't...",
        "Frasier: I am not jealous, Dad, I'm simply appalled by his rudeness. I was looking forward to this evening. [pouring himself a sherry] Nice drink, lovely opera. Then a late supper, perhaps a beautiful bottle of wine, delightful desert souffl\u00e9... Oh God, I need a woman.",
        "Daphne: Remember my friend Rowena? She's much prettier since her surgery! You look at her face and you can't even tell where it used to be.",
        "[N.B. In an earlier draft the line was, \"you look at her face and can't even tell where the extra one was.\"]",
        "Frasier: Thank you, Daphne. But actually, I already have someone in mind. You see, there's a stunning woman who comes to the opera on the same nights we do. She has the box right across from ours. We've flirted a bit from a distance. I have laughed with her during \"Figaro,\" cried with her during \"Tosca,\" I even had a dream about her during \"Einstein On The Beach.\"",
        "Roz: Well, don't just stare at her, make a move!",
        "Frasier: I will, Roz. Tonight's the night. By the final\u00e9 I will have made my overture. Dad, would you please come with me?",
        "Martin: To the opera? What do you need me for?",
        "Frasier: Dad, I can't go with a woman because then she'll think I'm on a date, and if I go alone she'll think I couldn't get a date.",
        "Roz: He would look pretty pathetic.",
        "Martin: Oh, geez!",
        "Daphne: Or you could stay home with us and watch sad movies.",
        "Frasier: [reads a title] \"Sophie's Choice.\"",
        "Martin: I'll say it is!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Scene Two - Opera Box. Frasier and Martin are sat in the box.",
        "Martin: Is she here yet?",
        "Frasier: No, not yet. That's her box over there, the empty one.",
        "Martin: Well, I'm not going to sit through a whole opera for some woman who's not even here.",
        "Frasier: Oh, for God's sake, Dad, give it a chance. You might actually learn to like it if you'd listen to one.",
        "Martin: Hey, your mother dragged to me a lot of these things when we were dating and they were all stupid. These stories make no sense whatsoever.",
        "Frasier: Oh, that is not true!",
        "Martin: Oh, all right, what's this one about?",
        "Frasier: Well, it's about Rigoletto, the hunchbacked jester in the court of the Duke. He has a daughter, Gilda, who's secretly living with him. But everyone thinks that she's his mistress. In this opening scene, Rigoletto mocks the Duke's enemy, who puts a curse on him.",
        "Martin: A cursed hunchback dating his daughter - well, nothing screwy so far!",
        "Frasier: He is not dating his daughter! Gilda is being courted by the Duke, who is disguised as a humble student.",
        "Martin: You see, that's what I mean. The whole thing's so unrealistic. Everybody's in love, pretending to be somebody they're not. And they're all swooning and gasping-",
        "Frasier, looking over at the other box, gasps loudly.",
        "Martin: Exactly, who acts that way?",
        "Frasier: Dad, she's here! She's here, and she's not on a date. That must be her mother.",
        "Martin: [looks and gasps] Wow, you're right, she is a looker all right.",
        "Frasier: All right, don't gawk, don't gawk, she'll notice.",
        "Martin: Well, I thought that was the point. You've got to get her attention.",
        "Martin begins waving until Frasier stops him.",
        "Frasier: No, Dad, please, don't wave! Just keep your eye on the stage.",
        "Martin: All right, but I bet you that gets results.",
        "The opera begins and the lights dim. Frasier and Martin applaud.",
        "Frasier: [looks] You're right, Dad, it did.",
        "Martin: [looks and gasps in horror; through a clenched jaw] Oh God, I wasn't waving at her, I was waving at the daughter!",
        "Frasier: That's not what the mother seems to think. [laughs] I think she likes you, wave back.",
        "Martin: No, I don't want to.",
        "Frasier: Wave back! You started it, wave back to her.",
        "Martin: Oh, geez! [reluctantly waves back]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Scene Three - Theatre Lobby. Martin and Frasier arrive from the box.",
        "Martin: Hunchback's got kind of a nice voice, but the daughter's kinda screechy!",
        "Frasier: Yes, well, she's no Renata Tebaldi. Gosh, I don't see them, do you?",
        "Martin: Oh, I bet you the old one's in the ladies room putting on more war paint!",
        "Frasier sees the two women coming towards them.",
        "Frasier: Here they are. Just try to be nice, Dad! If you are rude to the mother you will ruin my chances with the daughter! [they come over] Well, we finally meet.",
        "Emily: I feel like we're practically old friends.",
        "Helen: I'm Helen Browning, this is my daughter, Emily.",
        "Frasier: I'm Frasier Crane, this is my father, Martin.",
        "They greet him.",
        "Frasier: Well, can we get you some champagne?",
        "Emily: Oh, we'd love it, thanks.",
        "Martin: Oh well, let me give you a hand.",
        "Frasier: No, no, you know what, Dad, we can manage. Er, why don't you two stay and have a nice little chat?",
        "Frasier and Emily leave Martin and Helen alone.",
        "Helen: Lovely production, isn't it? I adore Verdi.",
        "Martin: Oh, he's my favorite.",
        "Helen: Though the woman singing Gilda's a bit off.",
        "Martin: She's no Renata Tebaldi.",
        "Helen: You know, if you like Verdi so much, I happen to have a spare ticket to \"Aida\" next week.",
        "Martin: Oh, that sounds great, but, er, if it's a week from tonight, I'm busy, I'm sorry.",
        "Helen: Actually, it's next Thursday.",
        "Martin: Oh, Thursday? Oh, you know there's this thing at my... at my wine club.",
        "Helen: That's all right, Martin, we just met, I shouldn't have asked.",
        "Martin: No, no, no, Helen, it's got nothing to do with you, it's me. I'm afraid I've given you the wrong impression of myself. You see, the truth is, I'm... [thinks]",
        "Helen: Gay.",
        "Beat.",
        "Martin: Uh, right, gay.",
        "Helen: I thought you might be. How many straight men remember Renata Tebaldi?",
        "Martin: [looks over at Frasier] Not many! [laughs]",
        "Helen: Well, I'm sorry if I was too forward, it's just that sometimes it's so hard to meet nice men.",
        "Martin: Tell me! [laughs]",
        "Frasier and Emily arrive with the champagne.",
        "Frasier: Here we are, Dad. Actually, good news, Emily has agreed to join me for a night cap after the opera. Cast her eye over my African art collection.",
        "The bells sound for act two.",
        "Frasier: Oh, well...",
        "Helen: Very nice meeting you.",
        "Martin: Nice meeting you, too.",
        "Frasier: [to Emily] I'll see you later.",
        "The Brownings depart for the stairs.",
        "Frasier: So how did it go with Helen? You didn't offend her, did you?",
        "Martin: No, not at all. It turns out I'm not her type.",
        "Meanwhile, Helen and Emily chat.",
        "Emily: Well?",
        "Helen: Opera Queen.",
        "Emily: Oh, sorry.",
        "Helen: Still, you know who he'd be perfect for?",
        "Emily: [excited] Yes! You know, he's here tonight! I'll bring him.",
        "Frasier and Martin walk towards the exit.",
        "Frasier: Right, Dad, we better hurry up. Don't want to miss the second act.",
        "Martin: Oh, who cares? It'll be just more goofy stuff that never happens in real life.",
        "Frasier and Martin exit.",
        "[N.B. John Mahoney is, in real life, a big opera buff.]",
        "End of Act One. Act Two.",
        "Scene One - Frasier's Apartment. Daphne and Roz are sobbing over a movie on the VCR as Frasier and Martin enter. Martin leaves to the kitchen.",
        "Daphne: How was the opera?",
        "Frasier: Lovely. Get out! [turns television off]",
        "Roz: Hey, that movie's not over.",
        "Frasier: Too bad, Roz. There's a stunning woman on her way over here, I don't want her thinking I'm running some sort of maudlin sorority house. Now, come on, shake a leg.",
        "Roz: [stands] You actually spoke to her, you didn't wimp out?",
        "Frasier: You have never seen me so suave.",
        "Roz: [goes to door] Some Valentine's Day! First my date bails on me and now I owe Daphne fifty bucks!",
        "She exits, as Daphne exits to her room. Frasier is not amused. Martin enters holding his beer up.",
        "Martin: [to his beer] Well, hello there. Will you be my \"Ballantine\"?",
        "Frasier: Dad, will you go get a glass, please?",
        "Martin: Oh, all right. [exits to kitchen]",
        "Frasier: [doorbell sounds] And drink it quickly. The last thing I need tonight is some third wheel cramping my style.",
        "Frasier opens the door to Emily on the arm of a very English and very camp Edward.",
        "[N.B. Brian Bedford appeared in \"Tales of the City\" with Dan Butler.]",
        "Edward: Hello! [laughs]",
        "Frasier: Hello.",
        "Emily: I hope you don't mind. Edward here was at the opera too, he's my partner.",
        "Frasier: [miffed] Your partner?",
        "Edward: At the gallery. I'm also her uncle.",
        "Frasier: Oh, [laughs] when you said partner, I thought you meant romantic partner.",
        "Edward: [horse laughs] Hardly!",
        "Frasier: I'm Frasier.",
        "Edward: [enters] Pleasure. What a marvelous view! [goes upstage] May I?",
        "Frasier: Yes, please.",
        "Edward exits to the balcony.",
        "Emily: Your father, is he dating anyone at the moment?",
        "Frasier: Well, no, but if you're thinking about your mother, I'm afraid they're not really right for each other.",
        "Emily: [laughs] Yes, I know. I meant Edward.",
        "Frasier: [surprised] Your uncle?",
        "Emily: Yes.",
        "Frasier: ...and my father?",
        "Emily: They're both single, they love opera and they were both married with kids when they came out of the closet. Your dad told my mother all about it.",
        "Frasier: Oh, did he?",
        "Emily: Well, she asked him out and he had to be honest with her.",
        "Martin enters and notices Edward, who has just entered from the balcony.",
        "Martin: Hi, there.",
        "Frasier: Yes, nothing like a little honesty to diffuse an awkward situation.",
        "Martin notices nothing unusual about Edward. To the contrary, he's pleased to meet someone his own age.",
        "Martin: Hi there, how are you?",
        "Frasier: [taking Emily's coat] Let me take your coat. Dad, this is Edward, Emily's uncle, he's her partner in her art gallery. Er, Edward, this is my father, Martin.",
        "Edward: [shaking hands] Pleased to meet you, Martin.",
        "Martin: Same here, and my friends call me Marty.",
        "Edward: Then Marty it is! I love what you've done with this place, it's the perfect blend of sleek elegance and [pointedly at chair] audacious whimsy!",
        "Martin: Oh, you like it, huh? Do you know, Edward's my favorite name.",
        "Edward: Really?",
        "Martin: Yes, I even called my dog Eddie. [calls] Eddie! [Eddie rushes in] Here he is.",
        "Emily: Oh, a Jack Russell! He loves Jack Russells.",
        "Edward: I have three of them. [to Eddie] All girls.",
        "Martin: Oh, well, we ought to get them together. Who knows, maybe a little romance'll bloom. [Edward reacts]",
        "Frasier: You know, Dad, maybe we should go fetch our new friends some drinks.",
        "Emily: I'd love some white wine.",

        "Frasier: Boy, you are really something!",
        "Martin: What?",
        "Frasier: You actually told Emily's mother that you were gay.",
        "Martin: Well, you said not to offend her, I thought that was a pretty good way to get her to cool her jets without hurting her feelings.",
        "Frasier: Dad, there's something you don't understand. You see, she told Emily.",
        "Martin: She got a problem with it?",
        "Frasier: Oh no, she's pretty okay with it.",
        "Martin: Oh, I get it, you're worried she'll know I'm straight, find out I've been lying to her mother.",
        "Frasier: Dad...",

        "Emily: [looks at knickknacks] Frasier, these pieces are wonderful, you've exquisite taste!",
        "Martin: Oh, he gets that from me. Yes, it was worth all the hours I dragged him around to the museums and the antiques shops teaching him about art and, you know... upholstery.",
        "Edward: Were you in the arts?",
        "Martin: Oh, well, actually, Ed-",
        "Frasier: Dad was a cop.",
        "Edward: Really? [nudges him] The, er, uniform and everything? [laughs]",
        "Martin: Yeah, in fact, er, that's what happened to my hip. I took a bullet trying to break up a robbery. Yeah, I called for back-up but it never showed up.",
        "Emily: [sighs in sympathy] Because you were gay.",
        "Martin: [takes her hand] Don't think I didn't wonder about that!",
        "Frasier gives him a look.",
        "Martin: Yes, that was the day I came out. Lying in that alley, covered with blood, bullet in my hip and I said, \"That's it! I'm gay, I like myself and I'm not living a lie anymore.\"",
        "Edward: I had exactly the same experience when I came out.",
        "Edward puts his hand on Martin's knee, to his surprise. Martin's eyes bug out as he looks at the hand, then to Frasier, then back to the hand again. Frasier just smirks at him.",
        "Edward: Not, exactly, perhaps. Yours was a bullet in the hip. For me, it was a Lufthansa steward named Gunther.",
        "Emily: [holds Frasier's hand] What did I tell you? I knew they'd hit it off.",
        "Frasier: [laughs] Yes, I had a feeling myself.",
        "Martin: And you didn't say a word, you scamp! Er, Frasier, why don't you come help me get some snacks for everybody?",

        "Martin: He's English, they all seem gay.",
        "Frasier: Lord!",
        "Martin: Well, we're just going to have to tell him the truth.",
        "Frasier: Oh, what? You found her mother so unattractive you pretended to be gay?! Dad, Emily is the most fabulous woman I have met in ages. If you screw this up for me, I will never forgive you, so just be nice, all right?",
        "Martin: But what if he asks me for a date?",
        "Frasier: I have news for you: You're on a date!",

        "Emily: [re: Edward] He's the exact same way. He'll watch anything.",
        "Daphne: [re: Martin] With him it's mostly sports. Just give him a bunch of sweaty men chasing each other around the field and he...",

        "Martin: Oh, yeah. I've let Frasier drag me to all kinds of places I didn't want to go to, just so that I could spend some time with him. You know, sometimes it's hard to humor your kids but...",

Finally he softens and leans over to sniff the flowers, then reaches out and plucks one stray flower from the bouquet and replaces it in a better location. He smiles with satisfaction and goes off to watch television."
