    "Recap": [
        "Frasier plans to work his charms on Charlotte to tempt her away from Frank ( Aaron Eckhart ), so he invites her for what she assumes to be a working dinner at a high-quality restaurant. For him, Frank also turns up. This becomes the first of several occasions on which Frasier ends up spending time with Charlotte and Frank, and at no point does Frank suspect that his intentions are less than honorable; on the contrary, he thinks of Frasier as a real friend. There is, however, tension between him and Charlotte, and matters come to a head one evening when Frasier has cooked dinner for Charlotte and Frank turns up unannounced. The couple have an argument and Frank walks out, leaving Frasier with just the opportunity he was hoping for. Martin plans to give Ronee her engagement ring, but when Daphne and Roz discover that it is the same ring he planned to give to Sherry , they insist that he sell it and buy one especially for Ronee. This he does, and the new ring is very impressive, but its origins are somewhat unexpected."

        "Niles: You would not believe the morning I...",
        "Frasier: Niles, would you be terrible offended if I asked you just not to not talk about it and sit quietly?",
        "Niles: Can I at least tell you...?",
        "Frasier: Shhh, shhh, please, I do not have time for your folderol today. I am meeting Charlotte for lunch and I'm planning my strategy on how to win her over.",

        "The waiter brings Niles' coffee.",
        "Niles: Thank you. So, what's your plan to get around him?",
        "Frasier: I'm merely going to present myself as the anti-Frank.",
        "Niles: Ah. So you're going to be not rugged and not handsome? Interesting.",
        "Frasier: No.",
        "Niles: You're also going to be not passionate and not committed.",
        "Frasier: Very funny.",
        "Niles: Maybe she'd like you if you were not interesting and not informed.",
        "Frasier: Niles!",
        "Niles: Well you said my day was folderol!",
        "Frasier: Sometimes it is!",
        "CUT TO: Roz and a man talking at the window table.",
        "Roz: I don't believe you.",
        "Steve: It's true. My roommate and I used to listen to your show Every day just for you. We fell in love with your voice.",
        "Roz: Really? [in a dusky tone] It's just a voice.",
        "Steve: Well, all the guys on my floor listen to you.",
        "Roz: To our show?",
        "Steve: Yeah.",
        "Roz: Boy, things sure have changed since I was in college.",
        "Steve: Well, it wasn't exactly college, more like prison.",
        "Roz: So was mine. So where'd you go?",
        "Steve: Prison.",
        "Roz: Oh. So... you fell in love with my voice?",
        "CUT TO: Niles and Frasier as Charlotte walks in.",
        "Charlotte: Hi. The boys rise.",
        "Frasier: Charlotte, hi. You remember my brother Niles.",
        "Niles: Yes, Charlotte, how are you?",
        "Charlotte: Oh, hello. Well, frustrated. Been selling this guy all over town, but no one's buying.",
        "Niles: [sitting] Well, perhaps if you threw in a toaster.",
        "Charlotte: I just have to call Frank before we head out.",
        "Frasier: Oh, right. So everything's settled between the two of you?",
        "Charlotte: Oh, yeah. He came over last night, I don't even remember what we were fighting about.",
        "She walks back to the payphone as Frasier grumpily turns to Niles.",
        "Frasier: You know what THAT means, don't you? [sitting] They had a long night of acrobatic make-up s*x.",
        "Niles: I just thought of another way you could be the anti-Frank.",
        "Frasier glares for a moment, then gets a gleam in his eye.",
        "Frasier: Niles.",
        "Niles: Mmm?",
        "Frasier: Keep an eye out for her, will you?",
        "Niles: What are you doing?",
        "Frasier: Research.",
        "Frasier opens Charlotte's purse and begins looking through it.",
        "Niles: Frasier, Frasier? Foul play!",
        "Frasier: Yes, all is fair in love and war. That's interesting. An anthology of Irish plays. Perfect!",
        "Niles: What do you know about Irish plays?",
        "Frasier: Nothing. But not for long. There's one area where no man",
        "has ever bested me, Niles: homework!",
        "Charlotte comes back and Frasier gets to his feet.",
        "Frasier: Charlotte, listen, I was just beeped by a patient who's desperate to see me, so do you mind if we just switch lunch for dinner?",
        "Charlotte: Actually, that's better for me. I have four new clients",
        "coming in. Just think: the woman of your dreams may be sitting in my office this afternoon.",
        "Frasier: Indeed she may.",
        "Frasier smiles, then turns and hurries out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Scene 2 - A Restaurant Fade in. Frasier hurries up to the Maitre D', Georges.",
        "Georges: Ah, Monsieur, so nice to see you again. Your special table is ready for you.",
        "Frasier: And the wine?",
        "Georges: As you requested, monsieur.",
        "Frasier: Right. And the roses?",
        "Georges: I'm so sorry, monsieur, I felt that the scent would distract from the wine's distinctive bouquet.",
        "Frasier: You forgot them, didn't you?",
        "Georges: Yes, forgive me.",
        "He hangs his head.",
        "Frasier: For God's sake, Georges. All right, send a busboy out to pick some wild flowers, please.",
        "Georges: Very good sir.",
        "He heads off as Charlotte comes in the front.",
        "Charlotte: Gee. You kinda sprinted ahead of me, there.",
        "Frasier: So sorry. I just wanted to make sure that we could get a table. Here, come and sit.",
        "Charlotte: This place is kinda fancy for a working dinner.",
        "Frasier: Yes, well, after the rigors of your camping trip with Frank, I thought you deserved a little elegance.",
        "Charlotte: Thank you. [She gets her notebook.] So, good news: I met this great woman today. How do you feel about dating someone a little taller than you?",
        "Frasier pours the wine.",
        "Frasier: How much taller?",
        "Charlotte: I don't know exactly, but I did have to turn off the ceiling fan.",
        "Frasier: Well, let's just put her in the maybe pile, shall we?",
        "Frank comes in and over to the table.",
        "Frank: Hi, sweetie.",
        "Charlotte: Hi.",
        "Frank: Sorry to interrupt. I know you're working.",
        "Charlotte: Frank, you know Frasier.",
        "Frank: Yes.",
        "Frasier: Yes, yes, good to see you, Frank.",
        "Frank: I just need the key to your apartment. I left my blue field notebook there and I want to double-check some whale songs I copied down.",
        "Charlotte: Oh, sure.",
        "Frank: We were in a boat all day, recording whale songs. I think we may have had a really big interpretive breakthrough.",
        "Frasier: Oh, you should tell us about it sometime.",
        "Frank: That's a great wine. Can I steal a glass?",
        "Charlotte: Yeah, here. [to Frasier] You don't mind, do you?",
        "Frank sits.",
        "Frasier: No, no, not at all. Although as the Irish say: \"A man takes a drink, the drink takes a drink, the drink takes the man.\"",
        "Frank: That's very good. \"As the old cock crows, the young cock learns.\"",
        "Frasier: Yes, well, wasn't it O'Casey who once wrote: \"The Irish treat a serious thing as a joke, and a joke as a serious thing.\"?",
        "Charlotte: You'd really have to ask Frank about that. He's the one who loves Irish literature. He lent me an anthology, but I haven't made much of a dent in it. I'm sorry, honey, I'm trying.",
        "Frank: I know you are, baby.",
        "He kisses her cheek as Georges brings a vase of wild flowers to the table.",
        "Georges: Your flowers as requested, monsieur. [noticing Frank] I'm sorry, I thought you were to be deux.",
        "Frasier: Yes, well now we are trois. Thank you, Georges, could you bring us another glass, please.",
        "Georges: [knowingly] Yes, I understand, monsieur. It is most sophisticated of you.",
        "He walks off.",
        "Charlotte: Frasier, you ordered these flowers?",
        "Frasier: Well, the table just looked so bare.",
        "Frank: These are great choices, man. These are Washington wild flowers, remember from our hike? Foxglove, fine toothed penstemon, harsh paintbrush. Ah, remember this one?",
        "Charlotte: Oh, it's on the tip of my tongue...",
        "Frank: Monkey-flower.",
        "Charlotte: Monkey-flower!",
        "Frasier: Yes, often confused with the chimp-pansy.",
        "They all laugh.",
        "Charlotte: Frank made the same joke this morning.",
        "Frasier: Oh.",
        "Frank: Great minds.",
        "Frasier: Yes, yes.",
        "George brings the menus, Frasier speaks to him in French.",
        "Frasier: Just two menus, Georges. This fellow is only staying for a drink.",
        "Frank: [in French] No, no. I'll take a menu. We're having fun. And to tell you the truth, I'm starving.",
        "Frasier: Oh, terrific.",
        "As Frasier glares at his menu in frustration, the word \"Merde\" appears in the subtitles.",
        "[N.B. Georges is meant to be French, but if you listen carefully you hear a hint of a Cockney accent.]",

        "Scene 3 - Frasier's Apartment Fade in. Niles and Daphne are on the couch. Martin opens the front door for Roz.",
        "Martin: Hi, how ya doin'?",
        "Roz: Hi. Hey, look at you, Mr. Handsome.",
        "Martin: Thanks. I'm gonna go hear Ronee sing at the Rendezvous. And then afterwards I am going to give her her engagement ring.",
        "He shows it off with a flourish and Daphne takes the box.",
        "Daphne: Oh, Martin, it's beautiful.",
        "Roz: She's gonna love this.",
        "Martin: Thanks. I forgot I had it. I bought it years ago for Sherry, but then we broke up.",
        "Daphne: You can't give Ronee a used ring!",
        "Martin: Sherry never touched it.",
        "Roz: Well, it doesn't matter. Ronee deserves something you picked out just for her.",
        "Martin: Well, she'll think I picked this out just for her.",
        "Daphne: But you didn't.",
        "Martin: But she'll think I did.",
        "Daphne: But you didn't. You'll have to sell that and buy Ronee a new one.",
        "Martin: Oh, what's the difference? Niles, come on, back me up here.",
        "Niles: You can't be serious!",
        "Martin: Oh, geez.",
        "He heads for his room.",
        "Martin: Fine, back in the vault.",
        "Daphne: Some vault. It's an old cigar box with a bunch of silver dollars and Eddie's baby teeth.",
        "[N.B. See [5.11], \"Ain't Nobody's Business If 'I Do.'\"]",
        "Frasier comes in from his room and grabs his jacket.",
        "Frasier: Oh, hey, Roz. What are you doing here?",
        "Roz: Oh, hi. I was just shopping around the corner, thought I'd stop by.",
        "Frasier: Oh, gosh, well unfortunately I have a date.",
        "Roz: That's okay, I have one myself. With Steve.",
        "Frasier: Oh, yes, your convict friend. Do you think that's wise?",
        "Roz: The man made one mistake. Besides, I don't know any guy who's not a little fascinated by fire.",
        "Frasier: Yes, and a felon now knows where you live.",
        "Roz: I'm not a total idiot.",
        "Her cell phone rings and she answers it.",
        "Roz: Hello? Oh, yeah, hi, Steve. I'm grabbin' my coat, I'll be right down.",
        "She walks past an outraged Frasier to the door.",
        "Frasier: You...?! She leaves.",
        "Niles: So, you have a date tonight.",
        "Frasier: Yes, yes, actually Charlotte and I have been out three times this week. We've been wine tasting, beach-combing, and we actually shared a blanket in a horse-drawn carriage.",
        "Daphne: I take it Frank's off in the mountains again?",
        "Frasier: Oh, no, he was there, too.",
        "Martin comes back out.",
        "Martin: Let's go. The others get up.",
        "Niles: You mean, it's been the three of you all week?",
        "Frasier: Well, it's not exactly how I wanted, but the more time I spend with them, the less time they spend alone together.",
        "They follow Martin out the door.",
        "Daphne: It doesn't bother Frank, you tagging along on their dates?",
        "Frasier: Frank? No. In fact, he's quite taken with me. It doesn't even occur to him that I might be a rival. Galling, yes, but it does give me more time to work my magic on Charlotte.",
        "CUT TO: the hallway as they wait for the elevator.",
        "Frasier: In another week, you can kiss Frank goodbye.",
        "The elevator opens to reveal Frank and Charlotte in a passionate embrace.",
        "Niles: Maybe we'll wait until there's not a line. Frank and Charlotte come off the elevator.",
        "Frank: Hi, guys.",
        "Niles: Hello.",
        "CUT TO: the living room as he passes Frasier in the doorway.",
        "Frank: Gangsta!",
        "Frasier: What it is.",
        "Charlotte comes in as Frank plops down on the couch.",
        "Frasier: So, uh, what's going on? I thought we were meeting downtown.",
        "Charlotte: I know, I'm sorry, but can we stay in tonight? I've got to get up early and catch a flight to Chicago for some divorce stuff, and Frank's beat.",
        "She sits next to him.",
        "Frank: Yeah, I was at the beach all day cataloging the stomach contents of a dead elephant seal. It was like all you can eat down at the Lobster Pot. I'm sorry, the collapse of our coastal fisheries is no joke. I'm just punchy.",
        "Charlotte: We brought some movies. We couldn't agree on which one to watch, so you break the tie.",
        "She holds out the DVDs and Frasier sits on the coffee table to look at them.",
        "Frasier: Hmm... \"The Perfect Storm\" or \"When Harry Met Sally.\" I guess I'm going to have to go for \"When Harry Met Sally.\"",
        "Frank: YES! He'll have what I'm havin'!",
        "Frasier just shrugs with his \"I can't win\" expression.",

        "MENAGE A HUH?",
        "Scene 4 - Frasier's Apartment Fade in. Charlotte is waiting in the hallway. When the elevator opens, Martin and Ronee get off. They notice that Charlotte's hair is unkempt.",
        "Charlotte: Oh, hi. We keep passing each other.",
        "Martin: Yeah. We got some dessert here, if you wanna stay.",
        "Charlotte: Oh, no thanks. I've got to catch an early flight, but tell Frasier I'll call him?",
        "Martin: Sure. Bye.",
        "Charlotte: Bye-bye.",
        "The elevator closes.",
        "Ronee: Do I know her? He unlocks the door.",
        "Martin: Yeah, she's the woman Frasier's been after. She has a boyfriend already, but maybe somethin' happened.",
        "Ronee: I'll say. You don't get that hair-style sitting up.",
        "CUT TO: the living room as they come in and Martin turns on the light. Frasier is asleep on the couch, Frank is asleep and curled against his shoulder.",
        "Martin: Oh, geez! He heads off to his room.",
        "Ronee: Well, so long as he's happy.",

        "Martin: Oh, hi guys.",
        "Niles: Hey, Dad.",
        "Frasier: Hey, Daphne, Niles. Listen, the opera tickets are right there by the phone. Wish I could use them myself.",
        "Daphne sits down, Niles hangs up his coat.",
        "Niles: You know, if you'd gotten a third, you could take that couple you're dating.",
        "Frasier: Yes, that's very droll. Frank injured himself on our hike, so I've got Charlotte all to myself this evening. I'm not going to waste this opportunity. I'm going to make her a romantic dinner and then tell her how I feel about her.",
        "Martin: Wow, really?",
        "Niles: Are you sure she's ready for that?",
        "Frasier: Well, I don't know, but I can't stand this ridiculous threesome anymore. You know, the worst part is how completely unthreatening Frank finds me. As if I'm some sort of a harem eunuch.",
        "He grabs some bags and his keys and gets ready to leave.",
        "Daphne: How'd he hurt himself, anyway?",
        "Frasier: Well, he strained his back carrying me over a brook.",
        "Niles: You wounded him and you're stealing his woman in the same day?",
        "Frasier: Well, I didn't ask the man to carry me! He simply hoisted me over his shoulder before I could stop him. That's not something you get used to, no matter how many times it happens.",
        "Martin: Don't you worry about it. You just do what you gotta do.",
        "Frasier: Thanks, Dad. Wish me luck. I'm making her beef bourguignon from a new recipe.",
        "All: Good luck.",
        "Niles: Flour the beef.",
        "Frasier takes spirit from this, then closes the door behind him.",

        "Daphne gets up and Niles crowds in.",
        "Daphne: Oh, let's have a look.",
        "Martin: I sold the old one and got this new one this morning.",
        "Daphne opens the box and Niles reels back a little.",
        "Niles: Dad, it's huge.",
        "Daphne: Oh, it's beautiful, Martin.",
        "Martin: Yeah.",
        "Ronee comes in the front.",
        "Ronee: Hi.",
        "Martin: Hey.",
        "Ronee: What's goin' on?",
        "Martin: Nothin'. Oh, you look lovely tonight. But you know, I think your hand is kinda underdressed.",
        "He holds the ring out to Ronee who takes it excitedly.",
        "Ronee: Oh, my God! Marty, it's gorgeous. I love it and I love you, in that order.",
        "She hugs him.",
        "Ronee: Oh, thank you. Listen, I've got to go wash my hands. I was eating Cheetos all the way over.",
        "Martin: I love this lady.",
        "Ronee hurries off, Daphne takes the ring again.",
        "Daphne: Oh, let's have a look. Oh, it's brilliant. Oh, you had it inscribed!",
        "Martin: I did?",
        "Niles: \"Lil' Cupid. Til Def Do Us Part.\" What is that?",
        "Martin: Let me see that.",
        "Daphne: Isn't \"Lil' Cupid\" that obese rapper? The one they arrested for drugs?",
        "Niles: Where did you get this ring?",
        "Martin: At an auction! [off their looks] A police auction.",
        "Niles: You can't give that to her!",
        "Martin: Well I can't take it back, she loves it.",
        "Daphne: Well, what are you going to tell her?",
        "Martin: Well, just relax, I'll handle it.",
        "Ronee comes back in.",
        "Martin: Well, there's my lil' cupid. All beautiful and clean. All you need is a bow and arrow, Lil' Cupid.",
        "Ronee: Why are you calling me that?",
        "Martin: I always call you that.",
        "Ronee: No, no you don't.",
        "Martin: Well, uh, maybe I mostly say it when you're not around.",
        "He looks at Niles and puts the ring on her finger.",
        "Niles: Oh, yes. It's always \"Lil' Cupid said this.\" or \"Lil' Cupid did that.\"",
        "Daphne: It looks beautiful on you.",
        "Ronee: Thank you.",
        "Martin: Now, promise me you'll never take it off, Lil' Cupid.",
        "Ronee: Okay, okay. I promise if you'll stop calling me that.",
        "Martin: Deal.",
        "They kiss.",
        "Ronee: I'm gonna go look at this in the mirror. She goes to the powder room.",
        "Daphne: How did you get it to fit her? Lil' Cupid's as big as a house.",
        "Martin: Keep your voice down. It was a toe ring.",
        "He smugly sits back in his chair with a beer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Scene 2 - Charlotte's Apartment Fade in. Charlotte is sitting at her table, Frasier comes in with two plates.",
        "Frasier: Here we are. Beef bourguignon with saut\u00e9ed fiddlehead ferns and walnut chutney.",
        "Charlotte: It's exactly what I need after the day I've had.",
        "Frasier: Well, maybe I could give you a neck rub while it cools.",
        "He starts giving her a massage.",
        "Charlotte: Oh... oh, you're the best. You know, I am so sorry you've had to put up with all this business with me and Frank.",
        "Frasier: What business?",
        "Charlotte: Well, you know, all this tension between us.",
        "Frasier: There's tension?",
        "Charlotte: He's a great guy, we just seem to be... I don't know...",
        "Frasier: Fighting? Growing apart? Not clicking?",
        "There is a knock at the door.",
        "Frank: Darling. Charlotte gets up quickly, snagging her hair.",
        "Frasier: Oh, gosh, I'm sorry, it's my watch. It's caught.",
        "Charlotte: Oh, got it?",
        "She turns around in his arms, while he reaches up and tries to release her hair. Frank comes in while they're in this compromising position.",
        "Frank: Shoulda known. The minute I'm laid up, you're over here making my lady dinner. You're true blue, buddy.",
        "He walks over and kisses Charlotte on the cheek.",
        "Frank: Hi, baby.",
        "Charlotte: Hello, Frank.",
        "He snatches a bite from Frasier's plate.",
        "Frank: Mmm, walnut chutney, that's daring. Frasier finally gets untangled and helps Charlotte to her seat.",
        "Frank: Were you giving her a back rub?",
        "Frasier: Uh, was I? Yes, I suppose I was, yes.",
        "Frank: Would you mind doing me? I took an aspirin after the hike, and my neck's still a little tight.",
        "Frasier starts massaging Frank's shoulders.",
