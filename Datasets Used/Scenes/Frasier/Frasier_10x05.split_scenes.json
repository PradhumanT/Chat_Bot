    "Recap": [
        "The Halloween season has come round again. Bulldog is bathed in glory after playing a practical joke on Frasier by replacing his BMW with a replica that had been smashed up. Frasier is humiliated and determined to get his revenge. His initial plan, which involves using a red balloon to cause Bulldog gradual psychological distress, meets with scorn when he explains it to Roz. He then decides to set up a terrifying scene in the KACL basement where Bulldog is working now, involving actors dressed as zombies . Martin and Roz help with the preparations, but they both agree that practical jokes are not Frasier's strong point, so this is bound to fail. After some thought, Frasier realises one way in which he can stage the greatest practical joke ever, even if it means changing direction in his plan. Meanwhile, Gertrude Moon challenges a child named Jason (who was also the main trick-or-treater, in Frasier's building in past seasons) who comes to Niles' apartment trick-or-treating . This leads to a childish prank war between the two; when Niles, Daphne, and Jason's parents step in, though, the two team up to play jokes on them."

        "ACT ONE",
        "Scene One - KACL Roz is in Frasier's booth, setting up for the show. The room is decorated for Halloween. Bulldog comes into the booth, laughing.",
        "Bulldog: Hey, Roz...",
        "Several employees pass by the open door laughing and congratulating Bulldog.",
        "Bulldog: Hi, hi, hi. Roz, you just missed the classic prank of all time. I'll admit it, this was my masterpiece.",
        "Roz: [excited] Oh, who, who? Who'd you get?!",
        "Bulldog: OK...",
        "Before he can begin he is interrupted by a passing female staffer.",
        "Employee: Way to go, Bulldog! He barks at her. Then Kenny comes in, laughing.",
        "Kenny: There he is! [slams chests and slaps hands with Bulldog]",
        "Bulldog: I got this friend down at the impound lot, who came across a smashed-up BMW, same make and model as Frasier's.",
        "Roz: You didn't! You got Frasier!",
        "Bulldog: I had his car towed from the garage, the wreck went in its place.",
        "They all laugh.",
        "Kenny: The doc totally freaked when he saw it. First he started swearing, and then he implored the heavens, and just when his lip started trembling, Bulldog comes out, tells him it's all a prank.",
        "Bulldog: Hey - Bulldog observes the mercy rule. Besides, I got the whole thing on tape.",
        "He proudly holds up the tape. Then Frasier comes in, stone-faced. Kenny runs out while Roz hastily turns back to her work.",
        "Bulldog: Admit it, Doc, I got you good.",
        "Frasier says nothing. He stares through Bulldog and starts setting up for the show. Roz ducks into her booth.",
        "Bulldog: Come on, [slaps Frasier's backside] say it: Bulldog's the best. [no response] OK, OK, how 'bout the bitch dance I taught you? [giggles, still nothing] Well, at least give me one up high!",
        "He raises his hand up for a high-five. Frasier grabs his wrist, twists his arm behind his back, and pushes him out of the booth.",
        "Bulldog: Come on - oh, come on, don't leave me hanging, Doc! Where's your Halloween spirit?",
        "Frasier shuts the door in his face and sits at his console. Bulldog re-enters, hand still raised.",
        "Bulldog: Don't worry, it'll be here waiting for you.",
        "He leaves. Frasier gets up and stalks into Roz's booth, stamping each word out of cold steel.",
        "Frasier: For the record, I knew immediately it was not my car. Mine has a bumper sticker on it that says, \"I AM PRO OPERA AND I",
        "VOTE!\"",
        "Roz: Frasier, you've got to admit, it was clever.",
        "Frasier: I admit nothing. That is the last we shall discuss of it, we have a show to do.",
        "Roz: OK.",
        "Frasier goes on the air. As he speaks, he removes some books from his briefcase and starts flipping through them.",
        "Frasier: Good afternoon, Seattle, and welcome to the Halloween edition of the Dr. Frasier Crane Show. Today we will be discussing the topic... of fears. Are they irrational hindrances, or evolutionary tools? Hmmm... the surprising answer, after these words.",
        "He goes to commercial. But someone has loaded the wrong cart into the player...",
        "Frasier: [on tape; wailing] My car! Ohhhh, no - my caaar! What did they do to you?! Oh, my bay-beee...!",
        "Frasier glares at Roz, who holds up her hands to show she had nothing to do with it. Frasier stabs the stop button on the player.",
        "Bulldog re-enters, hand still raised.",
        "Bulldog: Whenever you're ready.",
        "He leaves, waving goodbye with his raised hand. Frasier glares after him as Roz tries to control her laughter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "IS IT OCTOBER 31ST AGAIN?",
        "Scene Two - The Montana Niles's apartment at the Montana, Halloween night.",
        "Someone is ringing the doorbell insistently and knocking as well. Niles does not answer, instead he just peers through the spy hole. Daphne tiptoes in carrying a bowl. They both whisper to each other.",
        "Niles: Did you find something?",
        "Daphne: Do you think they'll take soy sauce packets?",
        "Niles thinks, then shakes his head. Gertrude strides in, not knowing why she should keep her voice down.",
        "Gertrude: Who keeps ringing the doorbell?",
        "Daphne: Shh! It's trick or treaters.",
        "The doorbell stops ringing, and Niles looks through the peephole.",
        "Niles: OK, they're gone.",
        "Gertrude: Well, why didn't you let them in?",
        "Daphne: Because someone forgot to get Halloween candy.",
        "Niles: Although, someone else could have picked it up since she was already in the store.",
        "Daphne: But, that would override the duty list that someone insisted on implementing. [smiles]",
        "Beaten, Niles cozies up and kisses his wife.",
        "Gertrude: If this is what you two call a fight, you're not fit to be married. I once held your father's head underwater, and-",
        "Someone rings the doorbell again.",
        "Daphne: Shh!",
        "Gertrude: Oh, for heaven's sake! [through the door] We haven't got any candy, shove off!",
        "Niles: Great, now they know we're here.",
        "Another doorbell.",
        "Gertrude: That is precisely what's wrong with this country, everyone's afraid to stand up to the children.",
        "She opens the door to Jason, a boy in some kind of space cadet costume.",
        "Jason: Trick-or-treat!",
        "Gertrude: Didn't you hear? We've got no candy!",
        "Niles: [clearly scared] We can offer you hotel soaps.",
        "Jason: But it's Halloween. I dress up, you give me candy.",
        "Gertrude: That costume's supposed to be scary?",
        "Jason: No, is yours?",
        "Niles bites his fingers, afraid of what the boy is stirring in his mother-in-law.",
        "Gertrude: Oh, a nice bite into an onion is what that mouth of yours deserves.",
        "Jason: If you don't have treats, you're going to get a trick.",
        "Gertrude: Do your worst! I'm not afraid of you. [shuts the door in his face] Honestly!",
        "She goes off to her room.",
        "Niles: OK, well, maybe I'll go get some candy after all.",
        "He heads toward the door, but freezes when he hears the unmistakable sound of EGGS whapping against the door. He hears three whaps, then nothing. He cracks the door and slowly opens it... and jerks backward as a fourth egg hits the door. He shuts it and walks up the stairs.",
        "Niles: OK, I'm going to need my slicker and my squash goggles!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "OKAY, WHAT IF",
        "THE BALLOON WERE BLUE?",
        "Scene Three - Caf\u00e9 Nervosa Roz is sat at a center table. Frasier comes in with his briefcase.",
        "Frasier: Good morning, Roz. May I join you?",
        "Roz: Sure, Frasier. Well, I'm glad to see you're not sulking today.",
        "Frasier: Yes, well, I had a little time to think about it, and I've decided to put Bulldog's prank behind me...",
        "Roz: That's very mature.",
        "Frasier: I'm not finished! - by visiting upon him a prank that is ten times more dastardly. Look at this.",
        "He opens his briefcase and shows her a legal pad, on which he has carefully drawn a picture of a car with a red balloon tied to the antenna. Roz stares, wondering if she's missing something.",
        "Roz: Looks like a car with a balloon tied to it.",
        "Frasier: Precisely. I will tie a red balloon to the antenna of Bulldog's car every time his precious Seahawks-",
        "He flips to the next page of the pad, showing what looks like a football strategy chart, the kind that a coach would draw on a locker room blackboard.",
        "Frasier: -lose a game. Over time, the conditioned response will become ingrained in his psyche. Eventually, the mere sight of a red balloon-",
        "Flip to the next page, featuring an enlarged picture of a red balloon.",
        "Frasier: -will bring about in him an inexplicable sense...",
        "Flip to the last page, showing a picture of Bulldog's face with tears streaming down it, attached to a thought bubble with a red balloon inside it.",
        "Frasier: ...of loss. [drops the pad into his briefcase] Check-and-mate!",
        "Roz: [stares for a second, then:] Isn't that... kind of out there?",
        "Frasier: That's the point. Well, of course, I could go with any one of your basic pranks - hand in warm water, and whatnot - believe me, I have an intimate knowledge of all of them. But what I'm looking for is something unmistakably ME. A signature prank, if you will.",
        "Roz: Why don't you just forget about revenge and give him his two minutes in the sun?",
        "Frasier: What, at my expense?",
        "Roz: Look at his life! You guys used to be equals, now he's stuck downstairs in that dark, musty archives room. You must have some sympathy for him, don't you?",
        "Frasier: \"Dark, musty archives\"... I think I could use that!",
        "He grabs his legal pad and starts drawing on a fresh page. Niles, Daphne, and Gertrude come in.",
        "Niles: Hello, all.",
        "Frasier: Hello, Niles.",
        "Gertrude: Why do we have to stop here? I could make coffee at home.",
        "Niles: Now, now, it's good to get out of the house, get some fresh air, exercise those lungs.",
        "Gertrude: My lungs are as strong as ever. Just yesterday, I finished a whole cigarette in two drags. [off their shocked looks] One off me record!",
        "Daphne: [sees Frasier's pad] What's this?",
        "Frasier: I'm devising the ultimate prank, to get my revenge on Bulldog.",
        "Niles: Ah, well just beware the dangers of juvenile one-upsmanship. Only last night, Mrs. Moon challenged a trick-or-treater, and he responded by pelting our door with eggs.",
        "Gertrude: Yeah, but I got the little monster back, by putting a big, greasy glob of Vaseline on his doorknob!",
        "Frasier chuckles with her, but Niles and Daphne are appalled. Clearly, they didn't know about this.",
        "Niles: You said you'd put an end to it!",
        "Gertrude: Hence the Vaseline.",
        "Daphne: Mum, he's a child!",
        "Gertrude: Well, it's time he learned you don't mess with Gertrude Moon without incurring my wrath. Now, excuse me, I require cocoa.",
        "She moves off to the counter with dignity.",
        "Frasier: You know, I think she has the right attitude. If I expect Bulldog to leave me alone, I've got to show him that he's dealing with a superior intellect.",
        "Roz: Show them the balloon car.",
        "Frasier glares at her, then drops the pad into his briefcase and primly snaps it shut.",
        "Frasier: I'm sure Da Vinci's early notes were full of laughs too! [gets up] Excuse me, I have devising to do!",
        "At the counter, Gertrude receives her cocoa from the Barista (the same unflappable one from [9.19] \"Deathtrap\"), who then refers to a bill.",
        "Barista: That'll be... $32.03.",
        "Gertrude: For one drink?!",
        "Barista: Your grandson ordered a bunch of cakes, and he said it was all on you.",
        "He points over her shoulder. She turns and sees Jason, laden with BAGS and grinning.",
        "Jason: Thanks for the treats, Grandma!",
        "He runs out, with a livid Gertrude in hot pursuit. Daphne and Niles moan and droop in their seats.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Scene Four - The Montana Back to Niles's apartment.",
        "Gertrude comes in, cackling to herself. She's wearing heavy gloves and an oil-stained mechanic's smock, carrying a BICYCLE'S FOOT PEDAL ASSEMBLY, with the chain still dangling from it.",
        "Gertrude: Oh, let's see the little sod get to school without these. Oh, this should settle it!",
        "She goes to her room, laughing evilly... not noticing the HUGE GOB OF SHAVING CREAM dripping out of the air vent above the hallway.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "STORAGE ROOM OF TERROR",
        "[Over the black screen we hear the boom of thunder, and the screen flashes white two times.]",
        "Scene Five - KACL Storage Room The storage room in the basement of KACL where Bulldog now works. It is pitch dark.",
        "Martin slowly opens the door from the stairwell and comes in hesitantly.",
        "Martin: Is anybody there?",
        "FOUR ZOMBIES rise from behind the stacked boxes and stagger towards him.",
        "Martin: [acting] Oh, zombies... the living dead. Help, help!",
        "Frasier: Everyone, hold please.",
        "The lights come up. The four zombies - three men and one woman - are actors, wearing tattered costumes and cadaver makeup.",
        "Frasier is standing in the corner of the room, behind a viewing screen on a tripod. The screen is connected to a camera mounted in a corner of the ceiling. Wires crisscross the floor, connected to the screen and other film set devices.",
        "Roz comes down the stairs and stands next to Martin.",
        "Frasier: Zombie Number Two, what are you doing?",
        "Zombie 2: I'm scaring Bulldog?",
        "Frasier: I see. Is that what zombies do, they scare people?",
        "Zombie 2: Um...",
        "Frasier: Wrong. They eat brains, and THAT'S what scares people. Now, look, this is our dress rehearsal, let's please try to get this right. Bulldog comes in, he hears noises, zombies go after his brain, and his terror is caught on videotape for us all to enjoy at a later date. Now, let's try this again. First marks, please.",
        "Martin: Oh, jeez, Fras, this is the fourth time through. Can somebody else play Bulldog now?",
        "Frasier: Dad, you said you would help me with this.",
        "Martin: Well, that's because you said we were gonna do a practical joke. I thought it would be fun.",
        "Frasier: Whatever gave you that idea? [to one of the actors] Todd, I am getting \"dead\" from you. But I am not getting \"undead.\"",
        "Todd: [bored] Still?",
        "Frasier: Let's try this then. After rehearsal, I want each of you to write a paragraph detailing who your character was when he or she was alive, how they died, and why they're now after Bulldog's brain.",
        "Martin and Roz trade a disbelieving look.",
        "Frasier: Honestly, Roz, you know, you haven't given me much to work with here. These are the worst actors I've ever seen.",
        "Roz: [annoyed] Well, I'm sorry, but the Royal Zombie Company just left town with its all-zombie production of \"Hamlet\"!",
        "Martin: How many more times are we going to do this?",
        "Frasier: Why is it that whenever Bulldog pulls off a practical joke, you all applaud him, as if he'd won some sort of bowl or cup or other sports dish? But when I ask you to give up a single Sunday, all I get is complaints?",
        "Martin: Well, because you keep turning it into work! This is supposed to be fun! Like a day at the beach! Oh, you do this kind of thing all the time.",
        "Frasier: Like when?",
        "Martin: Well, the last time we went to the beach!",
        "Frasier: A lot of people bring rakes!",
        "Roz: Look, Frasier, it's not too late to back out of this. Face it, jokes just aren't your specialty.",
        "Frasier: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Martin: Well, what she means, son, is that we all have our different blessings. And Bulldog's good at jokes and fun, and you're good at... reading, and, uh... telling people about the things you read.",
        "Frasier: Are you saying that you think I can't pull this off?",
        "Roz: Oh, I wouldn't put it that way.",
        "Martin: I would.",
        "Frasier: But I've worked this out to the last detail, nothing can go wrong!",
        "Roz: Everything's gonna go wrong! For one thing, Bulldog's gonna know something's up, 'cause Kenny hardly ever makes him work at night! And then look at all these cameras and all these wires, I mean, what if he spots these?",
        "Martin: And the zombies, as soon as he sees them he's gonna know it's a prank, because he just pranked you! [composure cracks] And there are no such things as zombies!!!",
        "Frasier slowly raises his arm, and imperiously points to the door.",
        "Frasier: You, sir... are released! Martin nods gratefully and walks out.",
        "Frasier: [to Roz] And you as well!",
        "She leaves, following Martin up the stairs. Frasier sticks his head through the door and yells up the stairs.",
        "Frasier: I'll pull this thing off by myself, proving you don't know what you're talking about! I don't need any of you!",
        "Taking this to be their cue, the zombies start to file out.",
        "Frasier: Wait, zombies, I do need you! [up the stairs] But no one else! I'll show all of you! You mark my words, tomorrow night I get my revenge!",
        "As if to mark his point, a crack of thunder comes from one of the machines sitting on a box, which then starts to blow misty smoke.",
        "Frasier: Ah, good, the effects machine's working again. [claps hands] All right, everyone, back to your first marks.",
        "The zombies wearily resume their places as Frasier returns to the camera.",

        "Scene Six - The Montana At Niles's apartment, Gertrude is pacing in the living room when someone knocks on the door. She opens it to a Courier.",
        "Gertrude: Where have you been?",
        "Courier: I'm sorry, I had a hard time finding this place. I checked the directory for \"Crane,\" but it had \"Old Bat\" next to this apartment number.",
        "Gertrude turns to a large toy box sitting next to the door.",
        "Gertrude: [to herself] A little obvious, but not bad. She picks up the box and gives it to him.",
        "Gertrude: I want you to deliver this \"Baby-I-Have-To-Tinkle\" doll to Jason White, Floyd Middle School. [gives him a paper] This is the address. I mean, he should be in gym class about now.",
        "Courier: I don't think I'm allowed to just walk into his school, ma'am.",
        "Gertrude: No, it's OK. I'm his grandmother. [points to the paper] And you have to say this.",
        "Courier: [reading] \"Your mommy said, bring this to you at school to lift your spirits. See? A dolly has accidents too.\" You really want me to say that?",
        "Gertrude: Yes, and very loudly. The poor thing's hard-of-hearing.",

        "Frasier: Todd, take off that baseball cap. You're undead, not uncouth.",
        "On the screen, Todd removes his baseball cap and signals acknowledgement at the camera. Behind Frasier, Martin and Roz enter the booth.",
        "Frasier: All right, everyone, step lively, look sharp. It's almost showtime. Give me a final room tone check, please, and... take your marks.",
        "Martin: Hey, Fras.",
        "Frasier: Well... hello. You've come to watch me fail, I suppose.",
        "Roz: No, we just want to come join you.",
        "Martin: Yeah, we're sorry about that stuff we said yesterday.",
        "Roz: Yeah, we came to see you have your day. It's long overdue.",
        "Frasier: Maybe I don't want you here.",
        "Roz: What do you mean?",
        "Frasier: You abandon me in my hour of need, now you're here to revel in my success, just like in Boswell's \"Life of Johnson.\"",

        "Frasier: All right, apology accepted. You may observe - in silence. Make yourselves comfortable.",
        "They stand behind him, eyes on the screen - and struggling to hide their smiles. Frasier focuses evilly on the screen, looking for all the world like Dr. Frankenstein as he manipulates his control panel.",

        "Beverly: [out into the hall] Jason, get back here! [to Niles] It seems our children have been feuding. We're very embarrassed.",
