    "Recap": [
        "Frasier, Daphne, Niles, Mel and Martin return from the funeral of Morrie, the doorman of Elliott Bay Towers. Martin bears a final gift from Morrie; a rare bottle of wine. Niles confesses to Frasier that he feels anxious about his relationship with Mel. After Niles denies that he still possesses feelings for Daphne, Frasier urges his brother to seize the moment and move on. Daphne reveals to Frasier that she knows about Niles' seven-year crush on her and she has fallen in love with him. When Niles returns from a retreat, however, he announces that he and Mel are married. Frasier tells Niles that Daphne knows how he feels towards her, and that there is a possibility she shares his feelings. The night before Daphne's wedding to Donny, Niles tells her that he loves her, and they kiss. Daphne then tells Niles that they have made too many commitments to others to back out now. The next morning, Niles sits in the Winnebago, unable to watch Daphne be married. Martin and Frasier join him and prepare to enjoy the rare bottle of wine, only to discover that it is undrinkable. Frasier and Martin leave Niles alone, until Daphne appears in her wedding dress, and asks if he wants to go on a date."

        "Scene One \u0096 Hallway Outside Frasier's Apartment",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Roz is standing at the door to Frasier's apartment when the elevator opens and Frasier, Daphne, Niles and Mel get off. All four are dressed in black.",
        "Frasier: Oh, hi, Roz.",
        "Roz: Oh, there you are. I brought something for Daphne and I was just gonna leave it with the doorman. [Daphne begins to cry]",
        "Frasier: Oh, lord.",
        "Reset to: Living Room They go in. Daphne heads into the powder room.",
        "Roz: Did I say something?",
        "Frasier: Well, actually our doorman, Morrie, passed away this week. We just got back from the funeral.",
        "Roz: Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry. Is she going to be all right?",
        "Frasier: Well, you know, she's been a little high-strung all week, even before he died. I guess it's just wedding stuff, you know.",
        "Roz: Yeah.",
        "Daphne comes back.",
        "Daphne: Ooh, sorry 'bout that. So, you brought me something, Roz?",
        "Roz: Well, yeah. I figured you couldn't get married without wearing something borrowed. [Hands her a small box]",
        "Daphne: Oh! What a beautiful garter! Look at all the lovely detail.",
        "Niles: I especially like the little odometer.",
        "Roz backhands him in the stomach as he grins.",
        "Daphne: Thank you so much, Roz.",
        "Mel: Does anybody besides me feel like a cup of coffee?",
        "Frasier: Oh, I'll brew a pot.",
        "Mel: Oh, don't be silly. I've been here enough times to know how to get the coffee made. Daphne, make us some coffee. [Then] Kidding!",
        "Niles laughs. She heads for the kitchen.",
        "Roz: [picking up a folder] The Wayside Inn. This is where you're having your wedding? Oh gosh, it's just so beautiful.",
        "Daphne: I hope it is, the planning's been a nightmare. I spent an hour today on the seating charts. Everyone has some demand. \"Don't sit me near the band\", \"Do you mind if I bring a friend?\"...",
        "Roz: Oh my God, you can't seat me next to him.",
        "Daphne: Exactly! Every selfish, whiny little thing...",
        "Roz: No, you cannot seat me next to Tim Walsh. I dated him all last summer and he dumped me.",
        "Daphne: He's going with my bridesmaid Annie. I have to seat the bridesmaids together.",
        "Roz: This always happens to me. Is there no place I can go without running into some guy I've dated?",
        "Niles: I was reading about a Trappist monastery in the Amazon that they somehow built into the treetop.",
        "Roz: Shut up, ya big doily! This is gonna be awful! Here I am at a wedding, sitting next to a guy who dumped me!",
        "Frasier: Oh, come on Roz, you won't be alone. You'll be on the arm of a well-known Seattle boulevardier and radio star.",
        "Roz: Frasier, I can't go with you. I mean, going to a wedding with your boss is like going to the prom with your brother.",
        "Frasier: Niles and I did not go to the prom together! Our dates were sick and we went stag!",
        "Niles: In retrospect, yes, we should have canceled the horse-drawn carriage, but hindsight is 20/20.",

        "Martin enters carrying a gift bag.",
        "Martin: Hey, Roz.",
        "Roz: Hi, Martin. I'm really sorry to hear about your friend Morrie.",
        "Martin: Oh, thanks. Yeah, his wife just did the nicest thing. I guess she knew Eddie and I'd stop by and shoot the breeze with him, so she gave us something to remember him by.",
        "Frasier: Oh, well. [Reading the tag] \"For Martin and Eddie.\" Gee, isn't that nice?",
        "Martin: Yeah, I think it's some kinda wine.",
        "Frasier: Well, yes I'd say so, but...",
        "He pulls out the bottle, reads the label, and gasps.",
        "Frasier: My God, Dad! This is a 1945 Chateau Petrus!",
        "Martin: Oh, yeah? She said he got it from his uncle who was in France after the war.",
        "Frasier: Well, it's one of the rarest bottles in the world!",
        "Martin: Well, if you're good, maybe Eddie'll give you a glass out of his half.",
        "Martin exits to the kitchen as Niles comes over to examine the bottle.",
        "Niles: I've never even seen a '45 Petrus!",
        "Roz: Oh, poor Morrie. He probably waited his whole life for an occasion special enough to open that bottle.",
        "Frasier: Yes. Perhaps this should be a lesson for us all. Morrie might be standing guard at the door to heaven right now, but he's buzzing us with one last message: Live life now. I'm reminded of a parable...",
        "Knock on the door.",
        "Daphne/Niles/Roz: Come in!",
        "The door opens and Simon (Daphne's obnoxious brother) enters with a duffel bag.",
        "Daphne: Simon!",
        "Simon: Hello, sis.",
        "Daphne: I thought you were in California.",
        "Simon: Yeah, well, those friends I went to surprise were out of town. So I decided to housesit for 'em, which was lovely. 'Til they came home last night. I don't know what all the screaming was about, I was the one in the tub! Where should I put this bag?",
        "Frasier: By the door so you don't forget it when you leave.",
        "Simon: Right. I think I know everyone here. [spots Roz] Or do I? And what would your name be then, Miss?",
        "Roz: Simon, you low-life idiot! You made a date with me last week and you stood me up!",
        "She crosses toward the door.",
        "Simon: Sorry, love, I need a bit more to go on.",
        "Roz: Maybe this'll refresh your memory.",
        "She slams the door in his face.",
        "Simon: Roz! Of course!",
        "Martin: [entering from kitchen] Well, look who's back!",
        "Simon: Well, who's this then? I'd say it was Marty Crane, but he's a bit too young and trim, eh?",
        "Martin: Oh, go on! Can I offer you a beer?",
        "Simon: Oh, I hate to drink alone, could I have a sandwich with that?",
        "Martin and Simon exit to the kitchen.",
        "Frasier: If that beer-swilling boomerang thinks he's staying here, he's got another thing coming.",
        "Niles: Better get a move on, he's already got your address on his duffel bag.",
        "The phone rings, Daphne gets it and goes to her room. Mel enters from the kitchen with a cup of coffee.",
        "Mel: We'd better get going if we're going to reach the cabin by dark.",
        "Frasier: Cabin?",
        "Niles: Yes, Mel and I are celebrating our six-month anniversary by taking a little mid-week getaway to her friend's country place.",
        "Mel: Yes, no phones, no stress, just two days of rest and relaxation. I do have to pick up a little anniversary gift, though, so give me nine minutes and pick me up at the northwest corner of Pike and Elm at 4:42.",
        "Mel and Niles refer to their watches.",
        "Mel: Coming up on 4:33...",
        "Niles: Synchronizing...",
        "Mel: Now! [Then] Good, I'm relaxing already.",
        "She kisses Niles and leaves. Martin and Simon enter from the kitchen.",
        "Simon: Thank you Marty, it's most hospitable of you.",
        "Martin: Well, you gotta have a place to stay...",
        "Frasier: Stop right there! He cannot stay here! The man is loud, ill-mannered, and the last time he stayed here he killed a ficus tree on the downstairs neighbor's balcony by means which are best left to the imagination!",
        "Martin: Frasier, I invited Simon to stay in my Winnebago! Come on Simon, I'll show you your new digs.",
        "Frasier: Oh, lord. Simon, you know I...",
        "Simon: Oh, no, forget about it. It's no worse than what I was just sayin' about you in the kitchen.",
        "Frasier: [chuckles] Good one.",
        "Simon: [sotto to Martin] He thinks I'm joking.",
        "Simon and Martin leave.",
        "Niles: Join me in a sherry, Frasier?",
        "Frasier: Oh, I think I will, Niles.",
        "Niles: You know, I have to admit, I'm a little bit nervous about this trip. I have a feeling Mel may make another push for us to live together.",
        "Frasier: Oh, my.",
        "Niles: She's been bringing it up quite a bit lately. She says it's a good way for us to test our relationship.",
        "Frasier: You're afraid you'll discover things about each other that you won't like?",
        "Niles: Oh, no. No, no. We're past that stage. She knows my likes and dislikes. I've come attuned to her various quirks... eccentricities... bugaboos.... b\u03bate noirs... night terrors. It's the fun of being in love. I don't know what's bothering me.",
        "Frasier: Is it possible that your foot-dragging might have anything to do with some lingering feelings for Daphne?",
        "Niles: Frasier, uh, you must realize I put that behind me months ago.",
        "Frasier: Just asking.",
        "Niles: I'm very happy with Mel.",
        "Frasier: Well then, what's your problem?",
        "Niles: Uh, well, let's see. I just got through with a rough divorce. I do have a tendency to be overly cautious...",
        "Frasier: This could be a chance to change all that.",
        "Niles: So you're in favor of it?",
        "Frasier: Well, I've never really been the president of the Mel fan club, but she does seem to make you happy. And as we were reminded this morning, life is not to be taken in baby steps. Ask not for whom the doorman buzzes...",
        "Niles: Thank you. All right. That was much-needed therapy.",
        "He gets up to leave.",
        "Frasier: Well, it was my pleasure. You're my brother, you get the family rate.",
        "Martin comes in as Niles gets to the door.",
        "Martin: Hey, guys. Got all the way down to the Winnebago and realized I had the wrong keys.",
        "Niles: See you guys in a couple of days.",
        "Martin: All right.",
        "Niles leaves, Daphne enters from her room on the phone.",
        "Daphne: You don't say, mum. Your phlebitis again? She looks pleadingly at Frasier and holds the phone out.",
        "Frasier: [bellowing] Daphne!",
        "Daphne: Got to go now, mum, Dr. Crane's on the warpath again. Bye. [Hangs up, then to Frasier] Thank you!",
        "Martin: Daph, I'm glad you're here, because I was thinking about that wine of Morrie's. You know, that's something really for a special occasion. So, I'd like you to have for the wedding, enjoy it on your honeymoon.",
        "Daphne: [starting to cry] Oh, Mr. Crane!",
        "She hugs him and cries on his shoulder.",
        "Martin: Oh, Daphne, come on. Come on now, it's only a bottle of wine. I don't even know that much about it. Frasier? Help me out here, will you?",
        "Frasier: Well Dad, Chateau Petrus is a premier crux Bordeaux...",
        "Martin: No, no, no. No, I mean with Daphne.",
        "Frasier comes over and holds Daphne.",
        "Martin: There you go.",
        "Frasier: Oh, Daphne.",
        "Martin leaves.",
        "Daphne: I'm sorry to get so emotional like this.",
        "Frasier: It's all right. The funeral must've really upset you.",
        "Daphne: It's not that. Dr. Crane? I've wanted to talk to you about this all week, but I haven't known what to say. You promise you'll keep this just between us?",
        "Frasier: Of course.",
        "Daphne: It's about your brother. You see, I know.",
        "Frasier: Know what?",
        "Daphne: I know about his feelings for me.",
        "Frasier: My God! How did you find out?",
        "Daphne: It's not important.",
        "Frasier: Somebody blabbed, didn't they? Why can't people just mind their own business? Who was the nattering gossip? Roz? Dad?",
        "Daphne: You.",
        "Frasier: What?",
        "Daphne: You were taking those pills for your back and you blurted it out while I was giving you a massage.",
        "Frasier: Oh, well, they were very strong pills, you see...",
        "Daphne: Needless to say, it completely took my breath away. At first, I tried to forget about it, put it out of my mind.",
        "Frasier: Well, the bottle said just to take one, but I'm a big man...",
        "Daphne: Oh, will you shut up about those pills?!",
        "Frasier: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.",
        "Daphne: Anyway, after a while, I couldn't put it out of my mind anymore. I find myself thinking about him all the time.",
        "Frasier: Daphne... are you saying that you have feelings for Niles?",
        "Daphne: I think I do. Oh, I don't know! Even if I did, he may not feel that way about me anymore, he's with Mel now!",
        "Frasier: I-I don't know what to tell you, Daph. Uh, I, I, think the best thing is for you to, to try to find a way to talk with Niles.",
        "Daphne: Ugh. That's not an easy conversation to have.",
        "Frasier: It's easier now than after you're married.",
        "Daphne: You're right, I have to talk to him. And right away. I'm already making myself sick over this. If I leave it any longer, I'll be a complete basket case. Uh, did he mention if he was going home?",
        "Frasier: Well, ah, actually, um, ah, he's going, ah, somewhere else first. Um...",
        "Daphne: Where?",
        "CUT TO: the hallway. Martin and Simon are getting off the elevator.",
        "Martin: Get you some towels and you'll be all set down there.",
        "Simon: Right.",
        "They enter the apartment, Daphne is again sobbing on Frasier's shoulder.",
        "Martin: Oh, geez, Daphne! It's just a bottle of wine!",
        "END OF ACT ONE",
        "ACT TWO",
        "ABSENCE MAKES THE HEART GROW FATTER",
        "Scene One - Frasier's Living Room. The doorbell rings.",
        "Daphne: [v.o.] I'll get it!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Daphne is in the apartment, eating cookies from a large bag. She puts the bag down, composes herself... and opens the door to reveal Frasier holding a lot of packages.",
        "Daphne: Oh. Dr. Crane! I didn't even know you'd gone out. I thought you might be your brother.",
        "Frasier: Well, I went down to get the mail and got all these wedding gifts for you. But don't worry, Niles called and said he'd be coming by this afternoon.",
        "Daphne: [picking up the bag and eating another cookie] I don't even know how I'm going to begin this conversation.",
        "Frasier: Well, I'm sure those chocolate-chip blackened teeth'll be a nice icebreaker.",
        "Daphne: I've been so nervous lately, I've done nothing but stuff myself with junk food.",
        "Frasier takes the bag and the doorbell rings.",
        "Daphne: Oh, it's him!",
        "Frasier: All right, all right, fine. You're gonna be just fine. Okay? Remember to speak from the heart.",
        "She goes to the door, composes herself... and opens the door to Martin.",
        "Daphne: Mr. Crane!",
        "Martin: Thanks! Eddie started doing his \"I don't know how much longer I can hold this\" dance and I just ran out without my keys. Have you ever seen him do that dance?",
        "Frasier: Just the droll impression of it you do at parties, Dad.",
        "Daphne: [again eating cookies] You know, Mr. Crane, Eddie seems awfully fidgety. I don't think he got enough exercise on that walk.",
        "Martin: Anybody needs any exercise, it's you, the way you're eating now. You know, when they put \"Party Size\" on that cookie bag, they don't mean party of one.",
        "The doorbell rings again. Frasier takes the bag and Daphne composes herself again \u0096 then opens the door to Simon.",
        "Daphne: Simon! What do you want?",
        "Simon: Well, I've just come to borrow a pen so I can fill out this job application.",
        "Frasier: What? Oh, you're applying for work? Well here, allow me. [Gives him a pen] Gosh, we'll miss you around here, but onward and upward! [laughs] So, what's the job?",
        "Simon: Doorman.",
        "Frasier gasps and staggers, as Daphne supports him.",
        "Frasier: Dear God.",
        "Simon: Well, it's ideal for me, really. Nice cozy chair, plenty of time to think the long, long thoughts of youth. Not to mention what the uniforms do for the ladies, ah? [laughs] If memory serves, a certain bellhop back in Manchester found that out with a young lady who will remain nameless.",
        "Daphne: Simon! [to Frasier] I tell you, I'm this close to just poppin' him one!",
        "Frasier: Now, now Daphne. Daphne, you just have to calm down. Here, have a cookie. [Gives her the bag, she eats one]",
        "Simon: What is up with your appetite lately? What, are you knocked up or somethin'?",
        "Daphne: Of course not!",
        "She storms toward him, Frasier grabs her.",
        "Simon: Now, now, you wouldn't be the first person in our family to be walking down the aisle carrying more than just a bouquet.",
        "Daphne lunges at him, with Frasier holding her back. The doorbell rings again.",
        "Frasier: Uh, Simon, why don't you finish filling that out in the kitchen and help yourself to a beer?",
        "Simon: Well, great!",
        "He goes to the kitchen. Frasier takes the bag as Daphne composes herself again... and opens the door to-",
        "Daphne: Roz!",
        "Roz: Hi, guys! Hey, Frasier? I felt kinda bad about the other day, dumping you as my wedding date...",
        "Frasier: You want me back, don't you?",
        "Roz: And I'm sick about it. But I can't find anybody else.",
        "Frasier: Sorry Roz, I already invited somebody else, she's driving up on Saturday to join me.",
        "Roz: Well, get rid of her! I need a date! I'm desperate!",
        "Simon enters from the kitchen with a beer.",
        "Simon: Well, well, somebody here is singin' my favorite song.",
        "Roz: Simon? There's a guy who lives in the park across the street from me. He wears a cat suit and meows at people. If he's busy, maybe I'll call you.",
        "Simon: I'm prettying myself up, just in case. Speaking of which, Daphne, I borrowed your blow dryer for my job interview.",
        "Daphne: I spent an hour looking for that! I thought I was losing my mind!",
        "Simon: Well, that does happen to women in your condition. You know, in the family way.",
        "Martin: [entering] You're pregnant?",
        "Daphne: I AM NOT PREGNANT!",
        "Simon: What, just another scare, then? Like that time back in school with that Pakistani chap?",
        "Daphne: [lunges at him] Right, that's it, you pig!",
        "Roz ducks out of the way. Frasier gets in front of her, scoops her over his shoulder and heads for the door.",
        "Daphne: Oh, put me down!",
        "Frasier: Daphne and I are going out for a breath of fresh air, perhaps retrieve her blow dryer. Oh, if Niles should happen to stop by, keep him here. There's something important I need to discuss with him.",
        "He is going out into the hall as he says this.",
        "Reset to: Hallway He shuts the door.",
        "Daphne: Oh, for God's sake, put me down!",
        "Frasier: Not until you promise not to kill your brother.",
        "The elevator opens, he goes in and puts her down. There is a neighbor with a basket of laundry next to them.",
        "Daphne: Oh, all right! It's not as if he doesn't deserve it, telling everyone I'm carrying Donny's baby! Like I don't have enough to worry about today, waiting for Dr. Crane.",
        "Frasier: Daphne, Daphne, you have to calm down.",
        "Daphne: It's not easy. I don't even know how to begin with him. \"Would you like steak or salmon at my wedding? And by the way, I think I might be in love with you.\"",
        "Frasier: You'll find the words when the time comes, all right? [Glares at the neighbor] And don't pretend you're not listening, Mrs. Richman! Your laundry is not that interesting.",
        "[N.B. Mrs. Richman is Doris from [5.09], \u0093Perspectives on Christmas.\u0094]",
        "Back in the apartment, Roz is on the phone.",
        "Roz: Oh, come on George, I'm desperate here. I promise you a good time. I mean a REALLY good time, if you get my drift. [Pause] You might have mentioned I was on speaker-phone!",
        "She disconnects.",
        "Simon: Listen to what you're doing, Roz. It's not very dignified, is it?",
        "Martin: Come on Roz, give Simon a chance.",
        "Roz: So he can stand me up again?",
        "Simon: And miss my sister's wedding? Never! If you're worried about my appearance, I know where I can get my hands on some very nice Armani suits.",
        "Martin: Or you could just grab one out of Frasier's closet.",
        "Roz: What did you think he was talking about? All right. But Simon, just remember my ex-boyfriend will be there. If anybody asks, you're an internet millionaire.",
        "Simon: Right. I'll be the perfect, well-bred, up-market gentleman. Now, I'll walk you to the garage.",
        "Roz: Ah, you don't have to.",
        "Simon: No, it's no bother. I live there.",
        "They go to the door and open it to find (at last!) Niles. He is wearing a large grin.",
        "Niles: Roz!",
        "Roz: Niles.",
        "Niles: Simon!",
        "Simon: Well, by the look of that smile on your face, I'd say somebody got himself a bit last night. [gestures lewdly with arms]",
        "Niles: [looking shocked and appalled] I find that remark rude, boorish and IMPOSSIBLE TO DENY! [Breaks out laughing]",
        "Simon: Brilliant!",
        "Simon gives Niles a punch in the arm, knocking him back into the hallway. Roz just looks disgusted as they leave. Niles comes in.",
        "Martin: Niles, how was your trip?",
        "Niles: Oh, fantastic, Dad. Where's Frasier? I have some news.",
        "Martin: He'll be back in a bit. What's up?",
        "Niles: Oh, well, uh, I should wait for Frasier, it was really his idea. Do you mind?",
        "Martin: I can wait.",
        "Niles: Okay, I can't!",
        "Martin: What is it?",
        "Niles: I'm married!",
        "Beat.",

        "Frasier grabs Martin's arm and cane and starts dragging him to the door.",

        "Niles: Yeah, we'll all go. [He starts to follow]",

        "Frasier: Well, uh, it's just wedding stuff, I guess. Speaking of which, I understand you have some, some news? You're married?",
        "Niles: Yes. I guess Dad couldn't contain himself any more than I could.",
        "Frasier: Well, I thought you were just gonna move in together.",
        "Niles: Well, so did I! But then the strangest thing happened. As we talked about it, we got more and more excited about the idea of being together. And then I remembered your advice.",
        "Martin gives Frasier a very hooded look right here.",
        "Niles: To stop taking baby steps through life. Before we knew it, we were asking the waitress for a phone book so we could find a justice-of-the-peace.",
        "The doorbell rings, Martin gets it.",
        "Frasier: Well, what can I say, but... congratulations.",
        "Niles: Thank you!",
        "They hug. Martin opens the door, it is Mel with a bottle of champagne.",

        "Mel: Oh, we can't keep something like this a secret! [takes Niles's hand] We got married!",
        "Daphne: [freezes for a second, then] Did you?",
        "Behind Niles and Mel, Frasier looks heartsick.",
        "Niles: Yes, while we were out of town. But the last thing we want is to upstage you and Donny, so we are not mentioning this outside this room.",
        "Mel makes a little lip-locking gesture.",
        "Daphne: [coming to them and taking each of their hands] Well, I am just so happy for you both.",
        "Niles: We're having champagne. Would you like to join us?",
        "Daphne: Oh, I'd love to. But I have to get a check down to the caterers, they're closing early today.",
        "Frasier: Let me drive you over, Daphne.",
        "Daphne: Oh, no, I'm fine. Congratulations again. Oh, save a glass for me.",
        "CUT TO: the hallway. She goes out into the hallway. We follow as she pushes the button for the elevator. Her shoulders shake with sobs she is holding back.",
        "As the elevator doors open, her face breaks and she lets out a sob. Mrs. Richman is standing there with her basket. She puts it down, opens her arms and takes Daphne into a hug to cry on her shoulder.",
