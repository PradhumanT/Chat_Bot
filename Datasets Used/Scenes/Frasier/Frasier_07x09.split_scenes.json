    "Recap": [
        "Frederick is coming to celebrate Thanksgiving with his father, while Lilith spends the holiday with a colleague. At the last minute, this colleague cancels, and Lilith asks Frasier if she can join them. He concedes, acknowledging that the season should be a celebration of family, even though there is still some awkwardness between Lilith and Niles following their brief tryst. Lilith happens to be writing an article about raising a child after divorce , and Frederick suggests she collaborate with Frasier, and do so while she stays at the apartment. He then goes to some effort to bring his parents closer together, saying privately to each how much the other is missing them, setting up mood lighting and romantic music. They realise that they are being set up, and that Frederick does not wish for them to get back together but is attempting to manipulate them into giving him a more extravagant gift."

        "Act One.",
        "Scene One - Radio Station. Roz is organizing some carts with her baby daughter Alice in her arms. Alice is dressed in a cute turkey suit. Frasier enters her booth and greets them.",
        "Roz: Morning, Fras.",
        "Frasier: Hi, Roz. Roz, is baby Alice dressed as a little turkey or am I just very, very hungry? [laughs]",
        "Roz: We're flying home for Thanksgiving right after the show. I thought I'd make Alice look as cute as possible so if she cries on the plane, the other passengers can't get mad. Actually, what I like to do is keep her awake so she'll sleep on the plane.",
        "Frasier: You know, you should just do what I used to do. I used to tell the passengers that if Frederick cried, I'd buy them all a drink.",
        "Roz: And that worked?",
        "Frasier: Oh, yes. In fact, one time I awoke from a short nap, and the fellow sitting behind us was flicking the back of Frederick's little ear. Of course that was cheating, the man did not get his drink.",
        "They cross to Frasier's booth.",
        "Roz: So when is Frederick coming anyway?",
        "Frasier: Well, Lilith is dropping him off around noon and then she's off to visit a colleague for Thanksgiving in Vancouver. You know, come to think of it, do they even celebrate Thanksgiving in Canada?",
        "Roz: They will when she leaves!",
        "Frasier nods in agreement as they begin the show.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "AS ALL OF VANCOUVER KNEELS TO GIVE THANKS...",
        "Scene Two - Frasier's Apartment. The doorbell sounds. Frasier answers it to reveal Lilith and Frederick.",
        "Freddie: Hi, Dad. [hugs him]",
        "Frasier: Frederick, hi.",
        "Lilith: Hello, Frasier.",
        "Frasier: Hello. Oh, gosh, you know, I was starting to get worried about you. You're an hour late.",
        "Freddie: We saw a big accident on the freeway. Mom saved this guy's life.",
        "Frasier: Really?",
        "Lilith: Well, that's going a bit far. I simply applied a tourniquet.",
        "Freddie: She's a hero.",
        "Frasier: [skeptically] Yes, that's your mother all right, son.",
        "Freddie: Then the paramedics came and wanted to give mom a transfusion.",
        "Frasier: [jokily] Yes, that's your mother all right, son.",
        "Lilith: If you don't mind, I'd like to use the phone and call my colleague and tell him I'll be late.",
        "Frasier: Yes, of course. Who is this colleague anyway?",
        "Lilith: [crosses to the phone and begins dialing] He's the man who supplies me with lab rats. It's about time we got together socially. I've known him for over fifty-two generations.",
        "Frasier: Ah. Well, if the drumsticks are about this big [shows a couple of centimeters with his fingers], you'll know why.",
        "Freddie: Good one, Dad.",
        "Frasier: Thank you, son.",
        "Lilith has just connected.",
        "Lilith: Hello, Peter, it's Lilith. Listen, I'm running about an hour late, so... [pause] Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Well, take care of yourself. Okay. Goodbye. [hangs up]",
        "Frasier: What happened?",
        "Lilith: Peter's come down with something. He thinks he caught it from the rats.",
        "Frasier: Oh, now, nobody caught anything from a rat that wasn't resolved in a day or two, off you go.",
        "[N.B. History has taken it for granted that the Black Death, to which this joke is obviously referring, was bubonic plague, which would have been spread by ticks and fleas jumping off the hides of rats. However, recent research has suggested that the Black Death might actually have been a form of anthrax, in which case the rats were innocent and the cows were to blame.]",
        "Freddie: Gee, mom, why don't you spend Thanksgiving with us?",
        "Frasier: Yes, that's a very good one, Frederick. Go kiss your mother goodbye and unpack, all right?",
        "Frederick complies to his father's wishes and exits to his Dad's room.",
        "Lilith: Would it be so unbearable for me to be here for one meal? As soon as we're done, I'll go and check into a hotel. I can spend the weekend working on an article I've been writing.",
        "Frasier: Well, you know, Niles is coming this afternoon, and it'll be very uncomfortable, I think. You know, you two haven't seen each other since your little tryst.",
        "Lilith: Oh please, Niles and I are adults.",
        "Frasier: I suppose you're right. It would mean a lot to Frederick. After all, Thanksgiving is a time to celebrate family.",
        "Keys are heard jingling in the corridor. Frasier half opens the door to Martin who doesn't see the company.",
        "Martin: Is the witch gone yet?",
        "Frasier: Lilith's still here, Dad.",
        "Martin: [shocked then collects himself] Oh, in that case, I'll ask you too, Lilith. Has my twitch gone yet? [twitches] I had some very strong coffee this morning and...",
        "Lilith: Skillfully done, Martin.",
        "Martin enters, closing the door behind him, as Frederick appears.",
        "Freddie: Grandpa!",
        "Martin: Oh, Freddie! [hugs him] How ya doing?",
        "Freddie: So, Dad, is Mom staying for dinner?",
        "Lilith: Yes, Frederick, I am.",
        "Freddie: Isn't that great, Grandpa?",
        "Martin: [through his teeth] Great, Freddie! Real great! Isn't that great, Freddie?!",
        "Freddie: Are you okay, Grandpa?",
        "Lilith: [hanging up her coat] He's worried about his twitch!",
        "The doorbell sounds. Frasier opens the door to Daphne, arms full with grocery bags, trying to tug a stubborn Eddie inside.",
        "Daphne: Come on, Eddie, come on.",
        "Frasier: What's the matter?",
        "Daphne: Well, he was perfectly fine until a block from here. Then he started whining and trembling, like he senses an earthquake or a dark force or- [not really noticing her] hello, Lilith - a vortex of evil. [notices her properly]",
        "Martin takes Eddie and carefully takes him into the kitchen, shielding him from evil with his overcoat.",
        "Freddie: I'll help with the groceries.",
        "Daphne: [hands them to him] Hey, Freddie. Thank you. [kisses him] Well, let's see how the turkey's coming.",
        "Daphne exits to the kitchen with Frederick.",
        "Frasier: Yes, Daphne's preparing dinner.",
        "Lilith: Oh, should we tell her there's an extra person?",
        "Clatterings of groceries are heard in the kitchen.",
        "Frasier: No need.",
        "Lilith takes a seat on the couch as the doorbell sounds. Frasier answers it to Niles.",
        "Niles: Hello, Frasier.",
        "He notices Lilith and crosses to her, sitting on the couch. He becomes very monotone.",
        "Niles: Hello, Lilith. Lovely to see you again. [kisses her]",
        "Lilith: Nice to see you, too.",
        "Niles: I trust your flight was uneventful?",
        "Lilith: Up, down, bumpy over the mountains.",
        "Niles: Isn't that always the way?",
        "Frasier: Lilith is joining us for dinner, Niles.",
        "Niles: What a nice surprise.",
        "Lilith: It certainly is for me.",
        "Niles: Well, not as nice as it is for me.",
        "Frasier is becoming very agitated by all this \"nice\" conversation.",
        "Frasier: Oh, stop it, both of you! I refuse to spend the day listening to your distilled chatter!",
        "Niles: Well, how would you have us behave?",
        "Frasier: Well, why don't you try going back to your former relationship?",
        "Lilith: All we did was insult each other.",
        "Frasier: Yes! You're willing to throw all that away just because of one ill-considered night of passion?! It happened, take from it what you can learn, move on!",
        "Niles: Well, I learned if you kiss her too fast you get an ice-cream headache.",
        "Lilith: You also learned that I have twice your upper body strength, so shut your pie hole!",
        "Frasier: Was that so hard?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Scene Three - Frasier's Apartment. Later in the day Daphne is mashing the potatoes in the kitchen when Martin enters. Bits of dishes are laid out on the side including a plate of cranberry sauce.",
        "Martin: Wait, wait, what are you doing?!",
        "Daphne: I'm mashing the potatoes.",
        "Martin: By hand? You're supposed to whip potatoes, therefore every bite tastes the same.",
        "Daphne: Isn't that a bit bland?",
        "Martin: Hello? Welcome to potatoes! Could you just once cook a traditional Thanksgiving meal? I mean, look at this cranberry sauce. [points to a dish of nicely smoothed sauce] It's supposed to keep the shape of the can, quiver a little bit. What are all these little chunks in there?",
        "Daphne: Those are cranberries.",
        "Niles enters with a box from a baker's.",
        "Niles: Dad, here you are, one frozen pumpkin pie on request.",
        "Daphne: Honestly, wouldn't you rather I just bake a pie from scratch?",
        "Martin: Is it that you CAN'T learn or you WON'T learn?",
        "Martin exits in disgust as Frederick enters after laying a superb arrangement on the table.",
        "Freddie: I'm done setting the table.",
        "Niles: Oh, you did set the table... [looks] It looks very nice, very elegant, Frederick.",
        "Daphne: Oh yes, Freddie's been quite the little helper. Every time I bend over to check the turkey, there he is.",
        "Niles gives Frederick a sly look. Meanwhile, in the room Frasier and Lilith are chatting.",
        "Frasier: So, Lilith, tell me about this article you are writing.",
        "Freddie: [enters] It's about me.",
        "Lilith: Essentially, yes. I was talking to a friend that works at the New York Times Magazine about raising a child after divorce and she pointed out that as a psychiatrist, I might have a unique perspective.",
        "Freddie: You know, since it's about me, shouldn't I get something for it?",
        "Lilith: You're not getting a minibike.",
        "Freddie: But Mom...!",
        "Lilith: We have talked about this. You can get one when you are fifteen.",
        "Freddie: But all my friends have minibikes.",
        "Lilith: Yes, and if all of your friends decided to enter a Level Four biohazard area without their environmental containment suits, would you do that too?",
        "Freddie: This is different!",
        "Lilith: No, it's not.",
        "Freddie: Dad!",
        "Frasier: Sorry Frederick, I'm with your mother on this one.",
        "Daphne: [from kitchen] Dinner's almost ready!",
        "Lilith: Excuse me.",
        "Lilith gets up and leaves to the powder room.",
        "Freddie: You know what I think, Dad? You and mom should write this article together.",
        "Frasier: Well, I'm sure your mom can write it without my help.",
        "Freddie: But it was her idea, she told me on the plane how much easier it would be. I just don't think she knows how to ask you.",
        "Frasier: It is an intriguing idea.",
        "Daphne enters.",
        "Martin: [from kitchen] Frasier! I could use some help out here.",
        "Daphne: He's picking the raisins out of the stuffing!",
        "Frasier: Oh Lord! Coming, Dad.",
        "Daphne and Frasier exit back to the kitchen. Then Lilith enters back from the powder room and sits with her son.",
        "Freddie: You know, I think you and Dad should write this article together.",
        "Lilith: Together? Well, I think the last thing your father wants is to collaborate with me.",
        "Freddie: But it was his idea. He just told me how much fun it would be.",
        "Lilith: Well, it's an interesting notion.",
        "Niles and Daphne enter from the kitchen. Niles is carrying a carved turkey.",
        "Daphne: Beautiful job carving that turkey, Dr. Crane.",
        "Niles: Well, I picked up a thing or two in medical school. In case you're wondering, this bird appears to have died of a massive head trauma.",
        "Daphne and Niles share a laugh as Lilith guides Freddie to the table.",
        "Lilith: Did you wash your hands, Frederick?",
        "Freddie: Yeah. Uncle Niles even showed me how to open the door with my elbow so I don't need to touch the handle.",
        "Niles: What are uncles for?",
        "Lilith: Daphne, is your fianc\u00e9e joining us?",
        "Daphne: No, I'll be seeing him later. Donny has his own Thanksgiving tradition. He has a dinner for all the divorced men he's represented during the year. He's hosting twenty-five today.",
        "Lilith: Wow! Twenty-five lonely, bitter men.",
        "Daphne: It's been a good year.",
        "Niles pulls out the chair next to Daphne so that he can sit by her, however Freddie beats him to it.",
        "Freddie: Uncle Niles, mom's writing an article about me.",
        "Niles: Really?",
        "Lilith: It's about raising a child after divorce.",
        "Frasier: Yes, it sounds fascinating, doesn't it? It's a subject that's very near and dear to my own heart.",
        "Lilith: Are you suggesting we collaborate?",
        "Frasier: Well, if you think I might be helpful.",
        "Freddie: What a great idea, you can write it together.",
        "Frasier: I'd be willing.",
        "Lilith: Well, we certainly did well on our first collaboration.",
        "[glances at Frederick]",
        "Frasier: You know, Lilith, we could probably get most of it done in the time you're still here in town.",
        "Freddie: And if you stay here, you can finish the whole thing.",
        "Frasier: Well, I guess it would be alright by me.",
        "Lilith: Daphne, would that be too much of an imposition?",
        "Daphne: Not at all, I'll be spending the weekend with Donny. [rises] Now, where is your father with that gravy? [exits to kitchen]",
        "Lilith: Then I'll stay here. Although maybe we should run this by your father.",
        "The clattering of a gravy boat is heard from the kitchen.",
        "Frasier: No need. End of Act One. Act Two.",
        "Scene One - Frasier's Apartment. Lilith and Frasier working through some notes on the couch. Lilith's hair has been taken out of its bun and they are sharing a glass of wine.",
        "Lilith: Yes, but I think we should have something about non custodial parents and discipline.",
        "Frasier: Exactly! The weekend the father needn't be a weakened father.",
        "Lilith: [laughs] Frasier, you still have a direct line to my funny bone.",
        "Frasier: [laughs] Thank Goodness the line wasn't stop.",
        "Lilith: [laughs] Stop! Now, if we laugh all night, we'll never get any work done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Scene Two - Frasier's Bedroom. Meanwhile, Frederick is sat on Frasier's bed playing a video game on the television screen. He seems very much into it. There is a knock at the door and Niles enters and sits with him.",
        "Niles: Hey Frederick, I'm leaving. [notices screen] Whatcha doing?",
        "Freddie: I'm saving the universe. Do you want to help?",
        "Niles: [laughs] I wouldn't know where to begin.",
        "Freddie: It's easy, I'll show you.",
        "Niles: All right, what do you do?",
        "Freddie: [hands him controller] That's your guy, you've just escaped from an intergalactic maximum security prison pod.",
        "Niles: Like they could hold me.",
        "Freddie: Now once you leave this chamber, you can go left or right, and different things will happen to you.",
        "Niles tries to play and in an instant a scream in heard from the game.",
        "Niles: What happened?",
        "Freddie: Wow! I never saw the guy trip and fall before. Try it again, you have two lives left.",
        "Niles: Okay. [tries again but fails] I can't seem to get out of this room, is this some sort of advanced level?",
        "Freddie: No, this is like the training area. I didn't even know you could die here!",
        "Niles: [tries again but fails] I have to get out of this room!",
        "Freddie: The reset button's on the right. Do you want something to drink? [rises]",
        "Niles: Quiet!",
        "Niles carries on playing as Frederick slips out of the room.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Scene Three - Frasier's Apartment. A minute or two later, Frasier is washing the dishes in the kitchen. Frederick enters.",
        "Freddie: Hi, Dad.",
        "Frasier: Oh, hi son.",
        "Freddie: How's the writing?",
        "Frasier: Well, it's coming along nicely, thanks.",
        "Freddie: Oh, mom wants to know if you're bringing over the wine?",
        "Frasier: Oh, of course, yes. [picks up wine glass]",
        "Freddie: You know, it's great to see you and Mom working together. I think she kinda misses you.",
        "Frasier: Really?",
        "Freddie: Yes, she talks about you all the time. Y ou know, how wonderful you are and how she's never met another man like you. [pointing to glass of wine] You go take that out to her, I'll finish up in here.",
        "Frasier: Thank you, son.",
        "Frasier exits the kitchen and enters the main room. He hands the glass to Lilith but stands firmly away from her.",
        "Frasier: There you are.",
        "Lilith: [surprised] Oh, thank you. I've been rearranging this outline, why don't you take a look.",
        "Lilith holds up the piece of paper. Frasier, not wanting to get closer, briefly glances at it.",
        "Frasier: Looks fine.",
        "Lilith: Frasier, you can't see it from there, sit down. [he does] You know, I'm really enjoying this collaboration.",
        "Frasier: Me too.",
        "Lilith: Is it me, or is it getting warm? [takes her jacket off revealing her bare shoulders]",
        "Frasier: [shaken up] It is a little warm!",
        "Eddie then rushes out from the corridor and heads straight to the door. He scratches at the door with fury trying to get out as Martin follows him.",
        "Martin: All right, boy, I'm coming, I'm coming.",
        "Frasier: [rises] Dad, let me walk you out. There's something I want to discuss with you.",
        "Martin: You know, I've never seen him so eager to take a walk, I wonder what... [notices Lilith] Oh, right.",
        "Eddie, Martin and Frasier exit the apartment as Frederick enters from the kitchen.",
        "Freddie: Hey, mom. How's the article going?",
        "Lilith: Very well, thank you.",
        "Freddie: You know, I've never seen Dad this happy.",
        "Lilith: Oh, what do you mean?",
        "Freddie: Well, all he does is talk about you. How pretty you look and how smart you are and how much he misses you.",
        "Reset to: Hallway Meanwhile, Martin and Frasier are having a one to one in the corridor.",
        "Martin: What makes you think she's coming on to you?",
        "Frasier: Well, actually Frederick told me, but you know, it actually makes sense. I mean, this colleague of hers gets mysteriously ill and then she lassoes me into writing this article with her and then all of a sudden before I know it, the bun is off and she's waggling her bare shoulder at me.",
        "Martin: Hey, some of us just had a big meal!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Scene Four - Frasier's Bedroom. Niles is sprawled out on the bed intensely playing the video game. A knock is heard at the door.",
        "Niles: It's not your turn yet, I still have two more lives.",
        "Lilith: [enters] It's Lilith.",
        "As she says this the computer gives out a \"scream\" as Niles fails again which adds to the comic timing. Lilith enters, shutting the door behind her, and sits on the bed next to Niles.",
        "Lilith: I need to talk to you.",
        "Niles: Does the door have to be closed?",
        "Lilith: I thinks it's best, it's of a personal nature.",
        "Niles: What's this about?",
        "Lilith: Well, it's about an attraction that I thought was over and now I'm beginning to think, maybe it's not.",
        "Niles: Usually in my dreams, this is where I try to run and can't.",
        "Lilith: This isn't about you, you egomaniac. This is about Frasier. I think he wants us together again.",
        "Niles: He knows how I feel about you.",
        "Lilith: Not us! Me and Frasier! Is there a chair here I could talk to?!",
        "Once again Niles fails on his computer game, and the scream is heard.",
        "Niles: Well, what makes you think he wants you to get back together?",
        "Lilith: Well, first he offers to collaborate on this article, now he's plying me with wine and at this very moment I expect he's asking your father to clear out for the night.",
        "Niles: So he took a professional interest in your article and he offered you some wine on Thanksgiving. Now who's the egomaniac?",
        "Lilith: Perhaps I am overreacting. I'll just have to keep my eyes peeled for more conclusive evidence.",
        "Lilith takes over the game pad and starts playing on the computer. From the way she plays, you can tell she is a pro at the game.",
        "Niles: I didn't know there was a door there!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Scene Five - Frasier's Aparment. In the corridor, Frasier and Martin are still conferring.",
        "Frasier: Then again, maybe I've just made this whole thing up in my head. Tell you what, Dad. Take a minute and then come back in. See what you think's going on in there and then find some subtle way to tell me what you think.",
        "Martin: All right, okay. Just give me a minute.",
        "Meanwhile, inside the apartment, Frederick is lighting romantic candles. He then turns the lights down low and switches on some light, classical music on the stereo. As Frasier enters, his son runs off to his bedroom. Frasier is worried by this environment. He notices the bottle of wine on the table and quickly hides it away in the kitchen. Lilith the enters also noticing the aura of the room. She is slightly angered by this as Frasier enters. They confront each other.",
        "Lilith: Frasier.",
        "Frasier: Lilith.",
        "Lilith: [worried] Well, isn't this nice?",
        "Frasier: [worried] Yes, very nice.",
        "Then Martin enters, and swiftly takes in the music, the lights, the candles, and Lilith's hair and shoulders.",
        "Martin: Oh, excuse me again, I just came back to get an umbrella in case it rains. [picks one up] But I hope it doesn't, because Eddie's just dying to play this new game I taught him. I take off his leash and I say, \"Run for your life!\" That's exactly what I say, \"Run for your life!\"",
        "Frasier: Thank you, Dad.",
        "Martin: Okay. [starts to leave, then] Run for your life!",
        "Martin exits.",
        "Lilith: Frasier, we have to talk.",
        "Frasier: Yes, Lilith, we do.",
        "Lilith: I mean, I can't just sit here all night waiting for you to make your move.",
        "Frasier: Well, you've just got this all worked out, haven't you!",
        "Lilith: Well, let's see. Candlelight, wine, soft music. What else do I need?",
