        "(Scene 1 - The Radio Station. Fade in. Frasier is on the air.",
        "Frasier: Go ahead, Sophie, I'm listening.",
        "Sophie: [v.o.] Hi, Dr. Crane. My husband's having some of his friends over to watch the game Sunday, and I think it'd be nice if I could have some of my girlfriends over too.",
        "Frasier: Sounds reasonable.",
        "Sophie: Exactly. I mean, it's just football.",
        "Larry: [in the background] Not football, Einstein, the Super Bowl.",
        "Frasier: Ah, that would be your doting husband now.",
        "Sophie: Larry, this is a private conversation. And for God's sake, use a plate!",
        "Frasier: Sophie, why don't you put your husband on the line?",
        "Sophie: Pick up.",
        "Larry: Ah, geez. [picks up, louder] Hello!",
        "Frasier: Larry, I gotta tell you, I'm afraid I side with your wife on this one.",
        "Larry: That just proves you don't know the first thing about football.",
        "Frasier: What I do or do not know about football has...",
        "Larry: OK, how's this: My wife's friends can come over if you can answer even one little football question. Like...",
        "Frasier: Now, I don't see that that's in any...",
        "Larry: You're down by six, you're on your own forty, three seconds left, what do you do?",
        "Frasier: Well, all right, you would...",
        "Roz gets his attention and grabs two telephone handsets.",
        "Frasier: You would take your receivers, [Roz sets them together] and line them up, [she pretends to throw] and then throw a pass. [big throwing gesture] A long, long pass.",
        "Larry: Yeah, and what's the name for that?",
        "Roz gets down on her knees, crosses herself, and prays with an innocent look on her face.",
        "Frasier: A Hail Mary. [Roz gives him the thumbs up.] Sophie and Larry, I hope you enjoy the game. In the meanwhile, this is Coach Crane saying, I'm listening.",
        "Roz comes over to change some tapes on Frasier's console.",
        "Roz: I'm impressed you're so good at charades.",
        "Frasier: I'm impressed you could mime a virgin. So, Roz, you walkin' out?",
        "Roz: No, I got stuff I gotta do. I've got some carts to rack, and I want to put together some Best of Crane tapes.",
        "Frasier: Oh, your mother's still in town?",
        "Roz: In town, in my apartment, and when I left this morning, in my refrigerator, smelling my milk!",
        "Frasier: Oh, lord.",
        "Roz: I, I love her, I just wish I could get a couple of hours to myself one night.",
        "Frasier: Well, why don't you just ask her? She might enjoy a little time to herself. I know my dad does.",
        "Roz: You are so lucky. I wish my mother drank alone.",
        "They walk over to Roz's side.",
        "Frasier: You know, Roz, your mom's about the same age as my dad, isn't she?",
        "Roz: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Frasier: Does she date much?",
        "Roz: Since my father left, practically never... no, hang on...",
        "Frasier: No, no, hear me out, Roz. Now, Dad hasn't dated anybody since he and Sherry broke up, I'm starting to worry he's lost his nerve. A date with your mom could be a tremendous favor to him.",
        "Roz: I don't know.",
        "Frasier: Oh, come on, I'll tell you what: I know it's awkward but there's a way to minimize that. Niles and I are having dinner with him tonight. We'll take him to McGinty's, he'll feel comfortable, you and your mother can just happen by. We'll see what transpires, you know, they'll never even know it's a fix-up.",
        "Roz: Oh, what the hell, I'll give it a shot, I guess. How's five sound?",
        "Frasier: Five? Your mother is ready for dinner at five?",
        "Roz: I keep her on Wisconsin time, that way she's in bed by eight.",
        "Frasier walks out. FADE OUT.",
        "A.K.A THE LAST ONION",
        "OUT OF POMPEII",
        "(Scene 2 - McGinty's Fade in. Niles and Frasier are sitting at a table, Martin brings a plate over.",
        "Martin: Hey, look what I got here, boys! A Funion Onion. The chef sent it over with his compliments.",
        "Frasier: I wonder what his insults are like.",
        "Martin: [to a waitress] Hey, Bonnie!",
        "Bonnie: Hey ya, Marty. Oh, you must be Frasier, the big radio star.",
        "Frasier: Oh, yes. Hello.",
        "Bonnie: Your dad is so proud of you, he talks about you all the time. Who's your friend?",
        "Martin: Now, what's wrong with you? I told you about my other son.",
        "Bonnie: [shaking Niles's hand] Oh, of course, what am I thinking? Nice to meet you, Eddie.",
        "Martin: This is Niles. How 'bout some beers, Bonnie?",
        "Bonnie: Coming right up.",
        "Niles: Oh God, look. The group coming in the door, they're from the Shangri-La.",
        "A group of guys come over and punch Niles on the shoulder. He puts up his fists and weaves back and forth.",
        "Jimbo: Whoa, it's the Coyote!",
        "Niles: Evening, evening, Jimbo. Check you later.",
        "The guys go over to the bar.",
        "Martin: Wow, you got a nickname down there already. That's great! The Coyote?",
        "Niles: Yes.",
        "Frasier: And how did you earn that honorific?",
        "Niles: Oh, it was quite the merry road. Yes. It evolved from Niles to Nilesy to Niley to Nile E. Coyote and now simply \"The Coyote.\"",
        "The guys at the bar start howling at him.",
        "Niles: Oh, well, just when I thought it couldn't be refined any further.",
        "Roz and her mother, Joanna, come in.",
        "[N.B. Eva Marie Saint's first (and Oscar-winning) film role was as Edie Doyle, Marlon Brando's love interest in 1954's \"On the Waterfront.\"]",
        "Frasier: Oh, goodness, look who's here! Roz!",
        "Roz: What? We don't see enough of each other during the day?",
        "Frasier: Hello, Joanna.",
        "Joanna: Nice to see you again, Frasier.",
        "Frasier: Nice to see you again, too. Please, won't you sit down and join us?",
        "Joanna: Oh, no, we don't want to intrude.",
        "Frasier: Oh, no, no, please, the more the merrier.",
        "Roz: All right. Mom, this is Frasier's dad, Martin Crane. This is my mom, Joanna Doyle.",
        "Martin: Very nice to meet you. And this is my other son, Niles.",
        "Niles: How do you do?",
        "Joanna: It's a pleasure.",
        "DISSOLVE TO: after dinner. Martin and Joanna have cleaned their plates, while the others still have food.",
        "Frasier: Roz, will you just look at the two of them.",
        "Roz: How did you two manage to finish all that?",
        "Joanna: Oh, please. This is how our generation ate every day. I used to live on cigarettes, whiskey sours and bacon cheeseburgers.",
        "Martin: Yeah, and what about breakfast? Fried eggs, sausage patties, hash browns...",
        "Niles: My God, last night I ate a profiterole and lay awake 'til dawn waiting for my heart attack.",
        "Joanna: Those were simpler times, weren't they, Marty?",
        "Martin: Oh yeah, we didn't worry about dumb things like cholesterol. We worried about puttin' food on the table, keepin' the yard clean and the car shiny.",
        "Joanna: And the H-bomb.",
        "Martin: Well, yeah, that.",
        "Frasier: Say, Roz, we better be going if we're going to get that work done tonight.",
        "Niles: Oh, I should be going too.",
        "Roz: Mom and me are going to that jazz club on Fifth.",
        "Frasier: But we promised to finish those promos tonight.",
        "Roz: Oh, right. Mom, I'm sorry, I totally forgot.",
        "Joanna: It's OK.",
        "Frasier: Wait, I've got an idea. Uh, Dad, since I'm kidnapping Roz, why don't you take Joanna to the jazz club?",
        "Martin: Well, sure, I'd love to.",
        "Roz: Is that OK with you, Mom?",
        "Joanna: If Martin's game, I'm game.",
        "Frasier: Oh, well, perfect. OK, you kids just have some coffee, we'll see you back at the apartment later, OK?",
        "Joanna: All right.",
        "Niles: Very, very nice to meet you.",
        "Joanna: Thank you.",
        "Roz, Frasier and Niles go to pay the check.",
        "Joanna: Look at them. They think we don't know this is a setup.",
        "Martin: Well, how could we figure it out? We're just a retired detective and an attorney general. [they laugh]",
        "CUT TO: Roz and Frasier by the bar.",
        "Roz: You were absolutely right, they didn't suspect a thing.",
        "Frasier: I told you Roz, just leave it to the master.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "(Scene 3 - Frasier's Apartment. Fade in. Daphne is sitting in Martin's chair eating popcorn and watching television. Roz brings another bowl in from the kitchen. Frasier is on the couch.",
        "Roz: God, I thought they'd be home by now.",
        "Frasier: Roz, will you please relax and watch the pageant with us? They're right in the middle of the talent competition.",
        "[She sits next to him.]",
        "Daphne: It's shameless the way they're sucking up to the international panel of judges. Miss Germany just played \"Lady of Spain\" on a French horn.",
        "Frasier: Roz, you're gonna chew that nail right off. Stop it.",
        "Roz: I can't help it. I'm nervous. Do you think it's gonna turn out OK?",
        "Frasier: Who cares?",
        "Daphne: Not for Miss Brazil. Look at the tree trunks on her. She's her own little rain forest.",
        "Roz: I just keep worrying that she's gonna have a lousy time, and it will be all my fault. Screwing up, like always.",
        "Frasier: Oh, come on, Roz. Your mother doesn't think you're a screwup.",
        "Roz: Oh, yeah? In high school, I ran my own informal shoplifting clinic. In college, I dropped out of pre-law because it interfered with Bruce Springsteen's touring schedule. And now I'm an unwed mother. What would you call me?",
        "Daphne: Tramp.",
        "Frasier: Daphne!",
        "Daphne: It's Miss Venezuela. If that dress of hers was slit any higher, you could see Caracas.",
        "Frasier stares at the set, Roz has to nudge him to get his attention.",
        "Frasier: Oh, oh, Roz. You know what? So what if they don't get along? So we made a mistake.",
        "Roz: [getting up for some sherry] You don't understand. My mother doesn't make mistakes. She does everything well. She's smart, successful, classy... oh, what the hell was I thinking?",
        "Frasier: [rising] About what? Setting her up with my father?",
        "Roz: No, that's not what I meant.",
        "Frasier: That is exactly what you meant!",
        "Roz: Well, OK, Frasier. No offense, your father is a very nice",
        "man, but let's face it: My mother was the attorney general of Wisconsin.",
        "Frasier: Well I hope he remembers to curtsey before the Dairy Queen!",
        "Daphne: [getting up] This is ridiculous. I'm going to watch this in my room. Miss Finland just laid out her plan to end world hunger, and I missed it!",
        "She goes off to her room. There is the sound of the key in the lock at the front door.",
        "Frasier: Oh, lord. He and Roz hurry to sit on the couch.",
        "Frasier: Oh, Roz, that is the best promo of all.",
        "Roz: Oh, hi! How was your evening?",
        "Joanna: Oh, the jazz was first rate. But I'm afraid I talked Martin's ear off.",
        "Martin: Oh, you're crazy. Your mother tells wonderful stories, Roz. I could have listened to her all night.",
        "Joanna: You are either too kind or a little tipsy. But thank you. Come on, Lammy. I really had a lovely time.",
        "Martin: Well, I can't remember when I had a better time. We're gonna have to do this again.",
        "Joanna: Bye, Frasier.",
        "Frasier: Goodnight, Joanna. Lammy.",
        "They leave and Frasier turns to Martin.",
        "Frasier: [grinning] So... Tell me all about it.",
        "Martin: Well, being a gentleman, I don't want to go into the details, so suffice it to say, it STUNK!",
        "Frasier: What?",
        "Martin: [putting up his coat] That was the dullest evening of my life. The way she drones on and on. Do you know how many metric tons of eggs Wisconsin produces every year?",
        "Frasier: No.",
        "Martin: Well, I do!",
        "Frasier: Oh...",
        "Martin: Look, Frasier, I know you meant well, but if you ever set me up again, I'll kill you in your sleep. Goodnight.",
        "He goes off to bed. There is a quiet but insistent knocking at the door. Frasier opens it to reveal Roz.",
        "Roz: [excited] I told my mom to meet me downstairs. I just had to come up and tell you. She had the best time! She can't wait to go out with your father again. Will you tell him to call her tomorrow? Oh, Frasier, this whole thing worked out like a dream!",
        "Martin: [crossing to the kitchen] It's amazing! Her voice is still echoing in my head!",
        "Frasier: Yes, it's like a fairy tale over here, too.",
        "Roz leaves. FADE OUT. End of Act 1 Act 2",
        "(Scene 1 - Cafe Nervosa. Fade in. Frasier and Niles are standing at the counter.",
        "Frasier: I've just got to find some way to tell Roz.",
        "Niles: Why? It's just going to hurt her mom's feelings.",
        "Frasier: Her feelings are going to be hurt anyway. She's here 'til Sunday. She's expecting him to call. Oh, dear God. At least this way Roz can let her down easy.",
        "Their coffees come.",
        "Niles: Looks like both of us have difficult conversations ahead of us.",
        "Frasier: What's yours?",
        "Niles: All week long, I have been getting less coffee and more foam in my cappuccino. It's about time for someone to raise a little hell. Who's on steamer duty?",
        "Frasier: Well, it's that hulking fellow, Thad. The one who doesn't react when his arm touches the steamer nozzle.",
        "Thad comes from the back. He is huge.",
        "Niles: Where is that suggestion box? He walks over and Roz comes in.",
        "Roz: Oh, hey Frasier.",
        "Frasier: Hi, Roz.",
        "Roz: Double espresso to go, please. [Roz and Frasier sit.] Listen, I really need to thank you again. My mother had the best time last night. And when we got home, WE started talking. We ended up staying up half the night.",
        "Frasier: Oh, Roz I'm glad for you, but...",
        "Roz: It was like a wall came down. She just opened up to me. She started talking about how hard it was on her when my dad left, and how lonely she's been, and it was like she was talking to a girlfriend instead of her screw-up daughter. So, has Martin called her yet?",
        "Frasier: No. But he will. Soon. Uh, he had a really busy morning.",
        "Roz: Well, how does this weekend look? 'Cause she's leaving Sunday night.",
        "Frasier: Sunday? Oh, well let's see, tonight is poker night, that's no good. Saturday he's made plans to, uh, drive Duke to Tacoma for that all day... Tacoma-Fest.",
        "Roz: Well, on Sunday we go to a matinee and then I drive her to the airport.",
        "Frasier: Oh, darn.",
        "Roz: Wait a minute. I can give my ticket to Martin and they can go together.",
        "Frasier: No, no, Sunday's no good, because that's the, uh...",
        "Roz: Oh right, it's the Super Bowl!",
        "Frasier: Right, the Super Bowl. You know how Dad is about football, it's like a religion with him. In fact, he's made Niles and I promise that we'd watch it with him this year.",
        "Roz: Oh, well, OK. Let's just forget about the tickets and we'll come over and watch the game. Is there any reason why that won't work?",
        "Frasier: Not that I can come up with.",
        "Roz: That's great, my mom's going to be so excited. [She turns to pay her bill, Niles takes it and puts it on the counter.] Oh, thank you, Niles. I'll see you Sunday at your Super Bowl party.",
        "She leaves and Niles sits.",
        "Niles: [sitting] I see you told Roz the news and she went insane.",
        "Frasier: Couldn't do it. Told her we were watching the Super Bowl with Dad and she and her mother are coming over.",
        "Niles: This is a nightmare!",
        "Frasier: I know. I've got to find some way to tell Dad.",
        "Niles: I have to watch the Super Bowl?!",
        "Frasier: I suppose the sooner I tell him, the better.",
        "Niles: Oh, not necessarily.",
        "Frasier: What do you mean?",
        "Niles: Well, you know Dad. If you warn him Joanna's coming over, he'll just bolt to McGinty's. If I were you, I'd wait until five minutes before game time and then spring it on him. That way he has no choice but to stay.",
        "Frasier: I think I owe him more than five minutes' warning. Besides, Dad would never deliberately hurt Joanna standing her up. He is first and foremost a gentleman.",
        "Martin comes in.",
        "Martin: I saw Roz, so I hid outside in case that old gasbag of a mother was with her. Well, I guess she wasn't, everybody's still awake.",

        "ROUGHING THE PASSER",
        "(Scene 2 - Frasier's Apartment Fade in. Martin is watching the pre-game as Frasier paces nervously.",
        "Martin: Look at those guys in the locker room. Nervous, hearts pounding, probably a little sick to their stomachs, poor kids.",
        "Frasier: Yes. Until I got out of high school, I didn't there was any other way to feel in a locker room.",
        "Martin: What's the matter with you? You keep looking at your watch.",
        "Frasier: Was I?",
        "Martin: Yeah. Is there something on your mind?",
        "Frasier: No, no, but there's something I wanted to talk to you about, but now's not the time.",
        "The doorbell rings.",
        "Frasier: Now's the time.",
        "Martin: Just let me get the door.",
        "Frasier: No, Dad, Dad, that's what I have to talk to you about. You see, that's going to be Roz and her mother.",
        "Martin: What?",
        "Frasier: Well, Joanna had such a good time with you the other night, and you did say that you would see her again, and rather than send her home with her feelings hurt, I had to tell her you wanted her here.",
        "Martin: What, like a date?",
        "Frasier: Well, that's the beauty of it. It's like a date, but it's not a date. Just, you know, make small talk, you pass the dip.",
        "Martin: No, Frasier, you don't understand...",
        "Frasier: Now, Dad, I know you found her a little less than scintillating, but please, it'll be over before you know it.",
        "Frasier opens the door, Bonnie is there.",
        "Bonnie: Hey, Frasier.",
        "Frasier: Hi, Bonnie.",
        "Bonnie: Martin.",
        "Martin: Hey, Bonnie, glad you could make it. Let me hold this. See, this is what I was trying to tell you, Frasier, I invited Bonnie.",
        "Frasier: [taking her coat] Oh, how nice.",
        "Martin: Well, what do you got here?",
        "Bonnie: Oh, it's my special deviled ham in the shape of a football. But I still need to put on some macaroni laces.",
        "Martin: Oh, the kitchen's right down there, just holler if you need anything. [She heads over.]",
        "Frasier: What did you invite her for?",
        "Martin: Well, because I like her, and I thought I might want to ask her out, and I thought if she came over for the game it might be a step in the right direction. I mean \"like a date but not a date.\"",
        "The doorbell rings again.",
        "Frasier: Now that's gonna be Roz and her mother.",
        "Bonnie: Should I put some coffee on while I'm in here?",
        "Martin: You better, we're gonna need it.",
        "Frasier: Would you come on, Dad? Would it kill you to be civil for the length of one Super Bowl? What is that, an hour out of your life?",
        "He opens the door to Joanna and Roz. Alice is with them.",
        "Martin: Hi! [The ladies shush them and motion to the baby.] Sorry. Come on in.",
        "Joanna: Thanks so much for inviting us.",
        "Martin: Wouldn't be fun without you.",
        "Roz: Frasier, could you show Mom where Alice can finish her nap?",
        "Frasier: I'm sure Dad would love to.",
        "Martin: My pleasure, just come this way, Joanna. So, you a big football fan?",
        "Joanna: No, actually I've never even seen a game. I was hoping you'd explain as we go along.",
        "They head down the hall, Martin pauses to glare at Frasier.",
        "Bonnie: [coming from the kitchen] OK, who's hungry? Oh, hey, I'm Bonnie.",
        "Roz: Hi, from McGinty's. I didn't know you were coming.",
        "Bonnie: Yeah, Martin invited me. He was real cute about it. He checked with all the waitresses to find out if I was single.",
        "Roz: Oh. [She looks questioningly at Frasier.]",
        "Frasier: Yes, well you know how Dad is always trying to, ah...",
        "Niles comes in.",
        "Bonnie: Hey, the Coyote!",
        "Frasier: Find a new girl for Niles. Niles, you remember Bonnie. She waited on us at McGinty's.",
        "Niles: Oh, of course. I'll have a vodka martini, very dry.",
        "Frasier: Don't be silly, Niles. Bonnie is here as our guest.",
        "Roz: Yeah, your dad thought you two might hit it off.",
        "Niles: [not enthused] Oh.",
        "Bonnie: [even less enthused] Oh.",
        "Niles: The Superbowl and a date. Hot diggity!",
        "Bonnie: Well, come here, you're just in time for my specialty.",
        "Niles: Oh, I... [She pops a cracker in his mouth.] Mmmm! Isn't that interesting! Something formerly ham.",
        "Daphne: [coming from her room] Well, I'm off to the cinema.",
        "Niles: You're not staying for the game?",
        "Daphne: Sorry, but Ameican football's not for me, and they're showing \"Wuthering Heights\" downtown. I think it's the most romantic movie ever made.",
        "Niles: You're going alone?",
        "Daphne: Yes, unfortunately. It's more fun to go with someone, except of course it always ends the same way: Me weeping all over me date's shoulder while he does what he can to comfort me.",
        "Bonnie: Oh, you should have seen me cry putting onions in this ham loaf. I must've gone through a whole roll of toilet paper.",
        "Daphne: Well, enjoy your game.",
