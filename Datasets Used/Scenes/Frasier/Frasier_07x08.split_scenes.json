        "Frasier and Niles have a minor car accident and end up at the hospital. While waiting for Frasier to be seen, Niles discovers that Maris' plastic surgeon , who is still sending him the bills for Maris' botox treatments, is based here. He takes the opportunity to confront this Dr. Mel Karnofsky, and finds that she is a young-looking, attractive divorc\u00e9e with a fussy nature akin to his own and an interest in the arts. Later that day, a local news report announces Frasier's death, a case of mistaken identity caused when he left the hospital early, and the person who took his place in the line suffered a fatal heart attack . When reading his obituary in the newspaper, Frasier reflects on his life, and all the things he has yet to achieve. Martin, meanwhile, enjoys the attention and free drinks he receives from everyone who thinks he has just lost his son."

        "ACT ONE",
        "Scene One - Frasier's Car Niles and Frasier are enjoying a ride in the BMW, and I use the word \"enjoy\" loosely. Frasier is driving, Niles is whining in the passenger seat with his raincoat collar turned up around his neck.",
        "Niles: I can't believe how cold it is in here.",
        "Frasier: Niles, the climate control is on, it's perfectly comfortable.",
        "Niles: Oh, really? Touch your tongue to the seat belt, I dare you.",
        "Frasier: I'm starting to regret I even asked you to this exhibit. I wanted to invite Regan, but after the disaster I made of our first date I just felt too ashamed to even ask.",
        "Niles: Well, you can't avoid her forever, she's your neighbor. Ask her again, what's the worst thing that can happen?",
        "Frasier: She'd ask me to stop harassing her, which would mean I'd have to spend the next six months riding in the service elevator with Guillermo and his three-legged cat!",
        "Niles: How is little Wobbles?",
        "Frasier: Fine.",
        "Niles slowly turns up the heating control.",
        "Frasier: I see what you're doing, Niles! If you're so cold there's a scarf in the glove compartment.",
        "Niles: Oh, really? I thought that's where you kept the butter and the eggs.",
        "Frasier: Well, now it's burning up in here! I'm gonna take this coat off.",
        "Niles: Are you insane?",
        "Frasier starts taking his coat off, not concentrating on the road.",
        "Niles: At least wait until we've stopped... They start arguing about the road.",
        "Frasier: Take the wheel!",
        "Niles: I'll take the wheel but... Frasier, stop. [looks into road] Stop!",
        "Frasier: No, it's almost off.",
        "Niles: No, I mean brake, brake!",
        "Frasier crashes into the next car in a minor fender bender. The airbags deploy and squash the Crane boys.",
        "Niles: Are you all right?",
        "Frasier: Yes. Thank heavens your fist softened the blow of the airbag!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Scene Two - Accident & Emergency Frasier and Niles are waiting to be called. Frasier is holding a blood-stained tissue to his nose. A man, Phil, is sitting next to them.",
        "Phil: Hurt your nose?",
        "Frasier: [looks at Niles] Yes.",
        "Phil: That's what I figured. Right when you came in, I said, \"That guy hurt his nose.\" So how did you, you know...",
        "Frasier: Excuse me.",
        "Frasier leaves him and goes to the receptionist.",
        "Frasier: Yes, hello, this is Dr. Frasier Crane here. I was just wondering, I filled out my paperwork about half an hour ago.",
        "Receptionist: They'll call you. We're seeing people in order of importance.",
        "Frasier: Oh really, well, I do have my own radio show.",
        "Receptionist: The importance of the injury!",
        "Frasier: Yes, of course.",
        "Niles: [to receptionist] Do you know, are there any plastic surgeons on call?",
        "Frasier: Oh Niles, that's not necessary.",
        "Niles: Can't be too careful, could be broken.",
        "Receptionist: Don't worry, the best plastic surgeons in town have their offices here. Dr. Rab, Dr. Karnofsky and Dr. Burke.",
        "Niles: Karnofsky? Mel Karnofsky?",
        "Receptionist: That's right.",
        "Niles walks back to Frasier and explains.",
        "Niles: Maris's plastic surgeon. Would you believe that charlatan is still picking my pocket a year after my divorce?",
        "Frasier: Good Lord, for what?",
        "Niles: Oh, for Maris's botox injections. They use those botcholeanen toxins that you put in the forehead, it deadens the muscles and takes away the wrinkles. I gave it to her as a gift one year for our anniversary.",
        "Frasier: Oh, yes, probably your tenth. That's toxins, isn't it?",
        "Niles: Anyway, Karnofsky keeps billing me for her follow-up injections.",
        "Frasier: Good Lord.",
        "Phil has already crept onto the scene.",
        "Phil: So you're divorced, huh?",
        "Niles: Yes.",
        "Phil: Me too, I'm Phil. [puts his hand out, Niles doesn't reciprocate] Fourteen years together. Came home one day and... oh hell, I probably shouldn't even talk about it.",
        "Niles: Okay.",
        "The brothers walk away.",
        "Frasier: You know, Niles, seeing as how we're here, why don't you go and find this Karnofsky and straighten this whole thing out?",
        "Niles: No, no, I can't leave you here injured.",
        "Frasier: That's all right, Niles, I'll be fine.",
        "Niles: Are you sure? I may just pay Dr. Karnofsky a visit.",
        "Frasier: You know, it really is outrageous what these scalpel jockeys get away with; convincing women like Maris to spend fortunes on their exterior, when frankly what they need is to take a good look at the woman inside.",
        "Niles: Right. Well, she did have one chemical pill where you could see her kidneys for a while.",
        "Frasier: [laughs] Off you go. Good luck, Niles.",
        "Niles: Thank you.",
        "Niles walks off down the corridor. Frasier looks over at Phil who is now sat down reading the newspaper. He slowly edges to the seat next to him, making sure he is not seen over Phil's paper. Frasier thinks he's safe until...",
        "Phil: [lowers paper] Not a pretty woman, my wife, but when she danced you couldn't keep your eyes off her.",
        "Frasier: You know, actually I'm feeling a lot better, goodbye!",
        "Frasier gets up and runs out of the hospital. Then the nurse comes to the front desk and calls.",
        "Nurse: Frasier Crane? [no response] Frasier Crane, we're ready to see you.",
        "Phil: That's me!",
        "Phil gets up to go with the nurse.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "WHAT, ME WORRY?",
        "Scene Two - Mel Karnofsky's Office. The office is decorated well with objets d'art. Niles is admiring the art as a man in a lab coat enters with a large, heavy box of files.",
        "Niles: Ah, Dr. Karnofsky, I see you've decided to make time for me!",
        "Clerk: Sorry, I'm from Records. I was told to bring over Maris Crane's files. [places the box on the desk] That's this year.",
        "The man then exits as a woman in a white lab coat enters from another door.",
        "Mel: Dr. Crane?",
        "Niles: [turns around] Yes.",
        "She puts down her clipboard and holds out her hand.",
        "Mel: I'm so sorry to keep you waiting. Melinda Karnofsky.",
        "To Niles's surprise, Mel Karnofsky is not just a woman, but a rather attractive one - with fine pale features, curly dark hair, and an ultra-fastidious air that he always thought was his exclusive province.",
        "Niles: [taken aback, shakes her hand] Oh, yes, of course, Niles Crane. About this billing issue...?",
        "Mel puts her hand on the box, then pulls it back. It is a little bit dusty.",
        "Mel: Oh my God, this box is filthy.",
        "She takes a wet wipe from her drawer and cleans her hands, which seems to fascinate Niles.",
        "Niles: Yes, the problem is I have received three invoices over the past six months.",
        "Mel: Yes, I'm so sorry about that. And I'm so sorry about all this dust. Do you mind, I'll have to turn on my hepafilter?",
        "Niles: Oh, you have a hepa... [notices and gasps] You have a Svenson!",
        "Mel: Yes. They're great, aren't they? [turns it on]",
        "Niles: Not to mention impossible to get in this country, I've tried.",
        "Mel: Well, I once did a favor for Mrs. Svenson. Oh, it's a long story.",
        "Niles: I'm all ears.",
        "Mel: So was she. Anyway, I've spoken to the accounting department about your bill and it was clearly our mistake. Please accept our apology, we'll take care of it.",
        "Niles: I appreciate that.",
        "Niles notices a print on the wall. It is a portrait of a woman done in the typical Cubist fashion of Picasso.",
        "Niles: Oh, I like that print very much. However, Mel seems to be obsessing with her coat.",
        "Niles: Everything all right?",
        "Mel: I'm sorry, I just noticed a smudge on my jacket. [points to an invisible mark]",
        "Niles: It's barely noticeable.",
        "Mel: You're being kind.",
        "Mel takes her jacket off - showing him a slender waist and an alluring pair of bare shoulders - and pops it in the bin.",
        "Mel: I got that print at the last museum show.",
        "Niles: Oh, I thought you looked familiar. Perhaps I've seen you there.",
        "Mel: Perhaps. I go to all of the openings, I'm on the museum board.",
        "Niles: Really? Well, congratulations. All the exhibits this year have been...",
        "Mel opens her wardrobe to reveal several identical white lab coats hung in seamless order. Niles notices.",
        "Niles: [passionately] Perfection!",
        "Mel: Well, thank you.",
        "Niles: I particularly like the Picasso. I'm a big fan of his Cubist period.",
        "Mel: Oh, striking, isn't she? Yes, I'd like to think if she came in here I could have actually helped her. [Niles laughs] You must think I'm terribly fussy.",
        "Niles: [passionately] Yes.",
        "Mel: Anyway, it was very nice meeting you.",
        "Niles: Likewise.",
        "Mel and Niles go to shake hands but before they do, Mel's phone beeps.",
        "Nurse: [v.o.] Dr. Karnofsky, Mrs. Magreshack has a question for you in room three.",
        "Niles: Helen Magreshack?",
        "Mel: Oh, I really can't say.",
        "Niles: Oh. [turns away, then leans in] She's finally having it removed?",
        "Mel: Why did she wait?!",
        "Niles: I don't know!",
        "They laugh. Mel exits as the man enters again. This time he has several file boxes stacked on a hand truck.",
        "Clerk: Found '98.",
        "Niles: Actually, that's all been settled. [picks up photo on desk] Can you tell me, is that her husband?",
        "Clerk: No, she's divorced. That's her son.",
        "Niles: Really? Dr. Karnofsky's so young, she must have had him when she was a child.",
        "Clerk: [skeptical] Okay.",
        "The man leaves as Mel enters again. She is surprised to see Niles.",
        "Mel: Oh, was there something else?",
        "Niles: Er, no. [walks away then] Er, no. Well-",
        "Mel: Yes?",
        "Niles: Mel, er... I was wondering, I, er...",
        "Niles strikes the box with his hands. Mel hands him a wet wipe.",
        "Niles: Thank you. Er, I'm not really sure how to ask.",
        "Mel: I think I know what it is.",
        "Niles: A-ha.",
        "Mel: And you've got no reason to be nervous.",
        "Niles: Oh, really?",
        "Mel: Yes. Just a few quick injections and those nasty little wrinkles in your forehead will disappear.",
        "Beat.",
        "Mel: Well, that is what you were going to ask, isn't it?",
        "Niles: [laughs] Yes.",
        "Mel: Well, it's a very simple procedure. Although your forehead will be numb for a while. I can fit you in at four-thirty.",
        "Niles: Oh good, that gives me time to do something I need to do.",
        "Mel: Excellent... [exits]",
        "As soon as she's gone, Niles throws a barrage of slaps at his own forehead in anger at himself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "DEAD MAN WATCHING",
        "Scene Four - Frasier's Apartment. Martin is sat in his chair reading the paper. Frasier is sat watching the news, holding a cold compress to his nose. The doorbell sounds. Daphne answers the door to Niles.",
        "Daphne: Hello, Dr. Crane.",
        "Niles: Hello, Daphne. I was on my way home, I thought I'd see how the patient was doing.",
        "Frasier: Oh, I'm fine, thank you, Niles.",
        "Niles: You have no idea how guilty I'm feeling. [to Daphne] I suppose he told you it was my fist that struck in the inadvertent yet powerful blow.",
        "Frasier: So how did things go with the nefarious Dr. Karnofsky? Did you give him a piece of your mind?",
        "Niles: Actually he turned out to be a she, and quite a reasonable she at that. [sits next to Frasier]",
        "Frasier: Really? That's quite a turnabout.",
        "Niles: Yes, well...",
        "Daphne notices something on Niles.",
        "Daphne: Dr. Crane, don't move.",
        "Niles: Why?",
        "Daphne: There's a mosquito.",
        "Niles: Where?",
        "Daphne: On your forehead.",
        "Niles: Uh-oh! [pats about acting on his head] Get off, get off.",
        "Daphne: It's already gone.",
        "Niles: Oh.",
        "Daphne: Oh dear, looks like it bit you.",
        "Niles: All right... [acting] Ow!",
        "Frasier: Niles, wrinkle your forehead for me, will you?",
        "Niles: Why would I do that?",
        "Frasier: Just do it. Wrinkle your forehead.",
        "Niles attempts but fails. He stands up in protest.",
        "Niles: I'm not your marionette!",
        "Frasier: You got a botox injection! You've got a forehead full of poison right now, don't you?",
        "Niles: I do not!",
        "Daphne: [looking at the floor] Well, that's strange. The mosquito fell right out of the air, dead. [picks it up and bins it]",
        "Martin: What's a botox injection?",
        "Frasier: Oh, it's a cosmetic procedure they use to eliminate facial wrinkles.",
        "Martin: Oh great, my kids are having plastic surgery. That's a nice age to get to.",
        "Frasier: I can't believe you let Maris's witch doctor work her magic on you.",
        "Niles: Mel is a perfectly lovely person! In fact, I was screwing my courage up to ask her on a date when she noticed this little flaw and I lost my nerve.",
        "Frasier: Yes, and most of the feeling in your face as well!",
        "Daphne notices something on the television.",
        "Daphne: Dr. Crane, look, your picture's on the news.",
        "Frasier: Well, turn it up, Dad, turn it up.",
        "We then see a close-up of the television. Over the newscaster's shoulder is a studio portrait of Frasier, with the caption, \"Frasier",
        "Crane: 1952 - 1999.\"",
        "Anchor: After checking into the hospital with what appeared to be minor injuries from a fender-bender, radio psychiatrist Frasier Crane died suddenly today. I'm sure it goes for all of us here at KYLL when I say he'll be sorely missed. [cheerful] But this rain won't be missed, will it, Flip?",
        "The three are watching it, gobsmacked.",
        "Frasier: Dear God!",
        "Martin: What the hell?",
        "Daphne: That's unbelievable!",
        "Niles: [flat face, shocked voice] Outrageous!",
        "[N.B. Frasier's birth year is given here as 1952 - three years before Kelsey Grammer's actual birth date. Thus, at this time Grammer is forty-four but Frasier is forty-seven.]",
        "END OF ACT ONE",
        "ACT TWO",
        "Scene One - Caf\u00e9 Nervosa Frasier is talking to Roz on a front table.",
        "Frasier: As it turns out, after I left the hospital some poor devil used my name to jump the line and he dropped dead of a heart attack. I must say, it does seem a bit strange having plunged all of Seattle, albeit temporarily, into so much grief.",
        "Roz: I know, I'll never forget where I was when I heard you had died. I was out on the street. There was this crowd watching a television through a department store window, and before I knew it, we were weeping and hugging each other.",
        "Frasier: Very amusing, Roz!",
        "Roz: And then it began to rain, and I had this feeling that all the angels were crying.",
        "Frasier: [irate] Yes, all right, Roz!",
        "Martin arrives from the back of the caf\u00e9 with a copy of a newspaper.",
        "Martin: Hey, Roz. Fras, have you seen this? [hands him the newspaper]",
        "Frasier: Yes, as a matter of fact, I did. [to a puzzled Roz] It's my obituary.",
        "Roz: They printed it?",
        "Frasier: Yes, they must have picked it up off the wire last night before the news ran that correction.",
        "Martin: Jimmy gave it to me at McGinty's. Boy, everybody was so nice to me, buying me beers and everything. You know, because of the shock I went through thinking I'd lost my son.",
        "Frasier: Dad, what are you talking about? You didn't think I was dead!",
        "Martin: Well, people don't have to know that. I could have been at home alone, wondering where you were and I get this strange uneasy feeling. So I turn on the TV and there it is on the",
        "screen: the face of my dead son.",
        "Frasier: But I was sitting right beside you!",
        "Martin: Well, what kinda story is that?",
        "Frasier: It's the truth!",
        "Martin: Well, the truth doesn't put anything on a coaster!",
        "Martin exits in protest.",
        "Roz: Well, there's something for your scrapbook, huh? Your own obituary. [begins to read it]",
        "Frasier: Yes, well... you know, frankly, it's-it's a little upsetting.",
        "Roz: [looks up] I don't think they meant to be insulting, you are \"lovably pompous.\"",
        "Frasier: Not that. It's just, seeing all my life in black and white, it just all looks a little incomplete.",
        "Roz: What do you mean?",
        "Frasier: Well, I was going to do so much with my life. I was going to write a novel, run for public office, I was gonna do my own translation of Freud...",
        "Roz: Well, what's stopping you? You're not actually dead.",
        "Frasier: I guess you're right. [laughs] I'm not dead, am I? [laughs] You know, maybe that's a good way of looking at this actually, more of a wake-up call.",
        "A lady interrupts him who has appeared.",
        "Lady: Dr. Crane, I was so relieved to hear that you're all right.",
        "Frasier: Well, thank you.",
        "Lady: I heard the news and I thought, \"What a shame, why he is such a young man.\"",
        "Frasier: That's so nice of you. Thank you, thank you so much. You know, you're right. What am I doing frittering away my day here in this coffee house? [stands] You know, I've got things to do. I've got fresh world to conquer. I'm going to go out there and grab life by the scrub. Look out destiny, here I come!",
        "Frasier marches to the door and exits out onto the street. However, a rumble of thunder followed by a downpour of rain sees Frasier hurrying back in wiping the water from his coat.",
        "Frasier: [excusing] Well, it's really coming down out there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Scene Two - Frasier's Apartment. Frasier is working on his laptop on the dinner table wearing a tatty old sweater and jogging pants as Daphne enters with the laundry. There are food baskets all around the place.",
        "Daphne: What happened to your clothes? Did you spill something on yourself?",
        "Frasier: No, no, no, I'm going jogging later.",
        "Daphne: No need to be sarcastic, just give me the clothes and I'll do another load.",
        "Frasier: No, I'm serious, Daphne. I plan to go running just after I finish my obituary. [off Daphne's glance] It's a self- actualizing exercise. You write your obituary the way you'd like it to appear - years from now, of course - and then it helps you to focus your goals. [sits back] Here they are, all my hopes and dreams.",
        "Daphne: [looks at monitor] These are dreams, all right. [laughs, then reads] \"Dr. Crane came late to athletics, he became a fixture in the Seattle marathon, the America's Cup yacht race, as well as the Kentucky Derby.\" [laughs] A jockey at your size! You better start writing an obituary for the horse.",
        "Frasier: Very amusing, Daphne. I meant as a stable owner.",
        "Martin enters and notices Frasier.",
        "Martin: Hey Fras. What you do? Spill something on your clothes?",
        "Frasier: No, I'm going jogging later.",
        "Martin: Well, there's no need to get sarcastic about it.",
        "Frasier: I'm serious, Dad, I'm going to have to start somewhere if I plan to run a marathon!",
        "Martin, however, hasn't listened and notices another food basket on the console behind the sofa. He takes a closer look.",
        "Martin: Ooh, we've got a new basket? Hickory Farms!",
        "Daphne: Yes, that one came this afternoon.",
        "Frasier: Dad, we agreed that we were going to send back all the condolence baskets intact.",
        "Martin: I know, I know, but, you know, if a can of pecans falls out here and there, who's going to notice? Oh, by the way. Guess who I ran into? That friend of yours from next door, Regan.",
        "Frasier: Really?",
        "Martin: Yeah. You know, she was pretty relieved to hear you weren't dead. You know, maybe there's still something going on there.",
        "Frasier: Oh, I don't know, Dad. I'd like to believe that, but I'm just too much of a realist.",
        "The doorbell sounds.",
        "Daphne: [reads screen] Tell that the two million people a year who visit \"Frasier Land.\" [laughs]",
        "Frasier: It's a website, it teaches children about psychiatry!",
        "Martin opens the door to Niles.",
        "Martin: Hi.",
        "Niles: Oh, hi Dad. I can't stay, I just realized I think I left my cell phone here last night.",
        "Daphne: Oh, yeah, I did see it somewhere. Let me just have a look for it...",
        "Daphne goes to the console to search for it.",
        "Niles: [to Frasier] Why are you wearing running clothes?",
        "Martin: He won't tell us!",
        "Daphne: [picks up cell phone and hands it to Niles] Here it is. It was buried back here underneath all these baskets.",
        "Martin: Oh, Daph! Look what you did! Rooting around in there, you poked a hole right through this... [Martin quite obviously punches a big hole through the cellophane on purpose] Hickory Farms basket! We can't send it back now! [He takes it to his chair.]",
        "Niles: Thank you, Daphne.",
        "Daphne exits to her room.",
        "Frasier: Niles.",
        "Niles: Yes?",
        "Frasier: Is that a bandage sticking out of your shirt?",
        "Niles: Oh, where?",
        "Frasier: Well, right there. [points to one on the back of his neck]",
        "Niles: Oh yes, I cut myself shaving.",

        "Martin: Oh, come on, don't you think you're overreacting a little bit? I mean, Niles sure seems happy.",
