        "Julia ( Felicity Huffman ) has finished her affair with Frasier's accountant, Avery, and is vacillating between depression and anger. Frasier offers his support, even despite her determination to break into Avery's office and cause chaos. During this escapade, they are forced to hide in a closet to avoid detection, and Frasier is surprised when Julia kisses him. She insists it was to keep him quiet, but he believes there must be more to it, and spends days trying to persuade Julia to talk it over with him. He also has to come to terms with the possibility that Roz may be leaving KACL, as she has been offered a job at another radio station as a program director. She in turn is worried because it appears she may have encountered the interviewer before, romantically. Meanwhile, Niles has discovered an unexpected enthusiasm for firearms ."

        "Scene One - Radio Studio Frasier is nearing the end of his show.",
        "Frasier: Well, I think we've got time for one last caller. Roz, who have we got?",
        "He looks over and sees Roz on the phone, turned away from him and writing on a pad.",
        "Roz: Mmm-hmm... mmm-hmm...",
        "Peeved, Frasier tosses a pencil against the glass to get her attention. She notices him, but waves him off.",
        "Frasier: Well, I suppose I'll be fielding this last one myself. Let's try line two. [pushes button] Go ahead, caller, your name and problem, please.",
        "Ernie: [v.o.] Yes sir, my name's Ernie, and I'm real angry at my dog.",
        "Frasier: Okay, Ernie. Uh, very often when people have feelings towards their pets it often reflect feelings they have about themselves and their place in society. So tell me, why are you angry at your dog?",
        "Ernie: [v.o.] Well, he keeps telling me to take off my foil helmet.",
        "Beat.",
        "Frasier: Would you hold on, Ernie? Um, someone will come on the line with the number of an expert in this sort of situation. Let's try, uh, line four. [presses button]",
        "Roz: [v.o.] Oh yes, of course I'm interested! I'll fax my resume right over!",
        "Frasier mutes the line.",
        "Frasier: Well, the news is up next, followed by the market update with Julia Wilcox. That's it for me today. This is Dr. Frasier Crane saying, good day and good mental health.",
        "He goes off the air and glares at Roz, who mouths, \"I'm sorry.\" Kenny enters with some copies, which he lays on Frasier's console.",
        "Kenny: Another great show, doc.",
        "Frasier: Did you even listen?",
        "Kenny: You don't have to eat every Big Mac to know it's a delicious hamburger sandwich.",
        "Roz enters.",
        "Frasier: Roz, what's going on?",
        "Roz: I'm sorry, but they want to interview me for the program director job at KPXY.",
        "Frasier: Well... that's great, but I didn't even know you were looking.",
        "Roz: I wasn't! They just called me, out of the blue! I-I'm actually shocked, because I have very limited experience in management. But, well, Kenny's in management, how hard can it be?",
        "Frasier nods in agreement.",
        "Kenny: Hey, it's not that easy. I know it looks like a monkey can do my job, but it can't. True story.",
        "Kenny exits.",
        "Frasier: Well, gosh, Roz, I, I must say I've got some mixed feelings about this. I mean, I couldn't be happier that you're finally getting the recognition you deserve, but I'm gonna miss you.",
        "Roz: Oh, let's wait 'til there's a real offer before we break out the Kleenex and champagne.",
        "Julia enters.",
        "Julia: Well, Roz, Kenny told me about your job interview. Good luck.",
        "Roz: Oh, I get it. It'll be good luck because if I get the job, I'll be gone.",
        "Julia: No, it sounds like a good position for you.",
        "Roz: Right, cause I get into a lot of sexual positions with a lot of guys.",
        "Julia: I'm saying congratulations.",
        "Roz: Oh. Thank you.",
        "She crosses back to her booth.",
        "Roz: [sotto voce to Frasier] What's her problem?",
        "Frasier: Oh, I...",
        "Roz closes her door.",
        "Frasier: Well, you're being uncharacteristically decent today. You all right?",
        "Julia: I'm fine. [then] All right, I might as well tell you before he does. Avery and I broke up.",
        "Frasier: Oh. Gosh, uh, what happened?",
        "Julia: I got tired of listening to him promise he'd leave his wife.",
        "Frasier: Well, I'm sorry. I realize you must be going through...",
        "Julia: Oh, I don't need your sympathy. I'm not one of your pathetic code three whackadoos.",
        "Frasier: I was just trying to help. No need to insult my callers.",
        "Roz sticks her head back in.",
        "Roz: Foil Helmet Guy says his dog needs to speak to you.",
        "Unable to say anything to Julia, Frasier just motions vaguely towards Roz's booth before exiting.",

        "Scene Two - Caf\u00e9 Nervosa The caf\u00e9 is packed - the line to the counter reaches back to the door, and every table is occupied. Frasier enters.",
        "Frasier: Oh, excuse me...",
        "He threads his way over to the table in the rear, where Daphne is seated alone.",
        "Frasier: Hi, Daph.",
        "Daphne: Hello.",
        "Frasier: Gosh, I've never seen this place so crowded. What's the occasion?",
        "Daphne: It's Mum's day off. Apparently there was a mass e-mail.",
        "Frasier: So, is Niles going to be joining us?",
        "Daphne: No, he's taking your father to the shooting range.",
        "Frasier: Oh, yes, yes, of course, I'd forgotten. He asked me to take him, but then I suggested that when it comes to guns, perhaps he would prefer someone of Niles's... caliber. [chuckles] I'm in rare form today.",
        "Daphne: You should see this place when they know you're not coming.",
        "As a couple leaves one of the tables in the middle, Julia comes in, talking on her cell phone.",
        "Julia: No, Avery... two-thirds of the work on that program is mine! Well, I don't have to prove it, it's a fact! Oh - oh, yeah?",
        "Another couple from the line tries to claim the table, but Julia drops her satchel on it.",
        "Julia: Well, I should have expected as much from a man who wears leopard print bikini briefs! [holds up phone, to the whole caf\u00e9] Avery McManus wears shiny, acetate, man-panties!",
        "She sits.",
        "Frasier: [to Daphne] Excuse me. He goes over to Julia's table.",
        "Frasier: Is everything okay?",
        "Julia: No. Now that I've dumped your b*st*rd accountant, he's trying to cut me out of our software program.",
        "Frasier: Software program?",
        "Julia: We - mostly me - developed a proprietary method for analyzing price/volume momentum - I call it vector scaling - that can quantify the likelihood of longer-term trends. Do you realize what that means?",
        "Frasier: [at a loss] It's good.",
        "Julia: That program is my baby, I have been working on it for months. I think your b*st*rd accountant has been using me all along. Thanks for setting us up!",
        "Frasier: I did no such thing!",
        "Julia: You know what I ought to do? I ought to go down to his office, demand my files, and then trash the place!",
        "She rises angrily, Frasier restrains her.",
        "Frasier: Just a second, just a second, just sit down. Sit down, please. [she does] Take a moment to calm down before you make any rash decisions.",
        "Julia: In a few hours, I'm leaving town for a week. There's no way I'm leaving your b*st*rd accountant in control of those files.",
        "Frasier: All right, well, if you insist, then perhaps I should go with you. Maybe I can help facilitate things.",
        "Julia: Why? What's in it for you?",
        "Frasier: Nothing! Surely you can conceive of the possibility that someone might want to just do something nice for you?",
        "Julia: You and Avery are in this together, aren't you?",
        "Frasier: Of course not! You're not being rational, you know. Perhaps Avery is just holding your program hostage because he feels hurt. Perhaps this is his clumsy way of trying to initiate a dialogue.",
        "Julia looks at him thoughtfully.",
        "Julia: You really do try to see the best in everyone, don't you?",
        "Frasier: Yes, I do.",
        "Julia: So, what do you see when you look at me?",
        "Frasier: Well... I see a woman who's been hurt, not once but many times. A woman who finds it so difficult to trust someone, she won't allow herself to be vulnerable. A woman... [Julia gets up and walks out] whose eyes are going to get stuck if she keeps rolling them like that!",

        "Scene Three - Shooting Range Martin is standing in a booth, firing an automatic. Niles is standing behind him, looking extremely uncomfortable. Both are wearing ear protectors and range glasses.",
        "Martin: Ah, look at that grouping!",
        "Niles: Hey, uh, Dad, you about ready to go?",
        "Martin: I guess I've still got the touch. Hey, Niles, you ought to give it a try.",
        "Niles: Thanks, Dad, you know how I feel about handguns. They breed violence.",
        "Martin: Oh, come on, this is just simple target shooting, that's all.",
        "He puts down his gun and calls his target back.",
        "Martin: Ha-ha, yeah! Here's one dirtbag isn't going to be selling crack at any schoolyards anytime soon.",
        "Three men standing at the next booth come over, having heard Niles.",
        "Red: You should listen to the man. Shooting's a great sport. [shaking hands] Red Brewer. And these clowns here are Mitch and Wayne.",
        "Niles shakes their hands, ad-libbing hellos.",
        "Niles: I'm Niles Crane, and this is my father, Martin Crane.",
        "Martin: [shaking hands] Oh, hi, how you doing, guys?",
        "Red: Listen Niles, let me show you how to do this. I think you'll enjoy it. It's pretty simple.",
        "He picks up his own pistol and demonstrates as he talks.",
        "Red: You just take a solid stance, hold the grip firmly, steady your gun hand with your other, fingers to fingers, thumbs to thumb, focus on the front sight, and squeeze the trigger.",
        "He fires, making Niles jump.",
        "Red: Okay, you try.",
        "Niles: Oh, you know, no offense, but I, uh, I just, I'm not real comfortable with guns.",
        "Red: You know, Mitch used to be that way, too.",
        "Mitch: Yeah, the only weapon I'd go near was a bow and arrow.",
        "Niles: [interested] I, uh, I got an archery badge at day camp.",
        "Red: This is like archery, but safer. The weapon's more stable, and you're in a controlled environment.",
        "Martin: Go on, give it a try, son.",
        "Niles: Well, I, uh, just - I'll do one little one.",
        "He steps up and takes Red's pistol.",
        "Red: Just remember: stance, grip, aim, relax, shoot.",
        "Niles: Okay. [mimics Red] Stance, grip, aim, relax... [tilts his head to the left] shoot.",
        "He pulls the trigger. The recoil knocks him back about a foot, but Martin and the guys look pleased.",
        "Niles: Did I do it?",
        "Red: You not only did it, you hit the target. [points] See? Sixth ring out. Look at the kid, he hit the target his first time.",
        "Mitch: Not bad, kid.",
        "Wayne: Way to go, kid.",
        "Martin: That's my kid!",
        "Niles: That was a unique experience. I'm sure I'll dine out on that story for months.",
        "Red: Don't quit now, go again. But remember, this time, squeeze the trigger, don't pull.",
        "Niles: Okay.",
        "He takes his stance again, with his head cocked to the left again.",
        "Niles: Squeeze... He fires again, this time staying on balance.",
        "Red: Wow, you're pretty good at this! The kid's a natural, am I right?",
        "Niles: Can I go again?",
        "Red: Yeah.",
        "Niles, more confident, fires one shot after the other. He experiments, tilting his head to the right and sighting with his other eye, as we:",

        "Scene Four - Avery's Office Julia is pacing outside Avery's office door, when Frasier comes in.",
        "Julia: What took you so long?",
        "Frasier: I was looking for street parking. Do you have any idea how much this garage charges?",
        "Julia knocks on the door. No answer. She knocks again.",
        "Julia: Avery's not here.",
        "Frasier: Oh, great, it cost me three-fifty to find that out.",
        "Julia: No, it's good. It'll make it easier for me to get my program back.",
        "Frasier: What do you mean?",
        "Julia: I know his keypad code. [starts to enter it]",
        "Frasier: Wh-wh-what? That is breaking and entering!",
        "Julia: Oh, if you're so scared, why don't you just leave?",
        "Frasier: Well, I'm-I'm not scared! I...",
        "The door opens, and Julia enters the office. Frasier follows her in.",
        "RESET TO: Office Julia starts to rifle through Avery's desk.",
        "Frasier: I'll have you know I've had my fair share of escapades. Back in med school I once dressed a cadaver in cap and gown and...",
        "Julia: [finds a disk] Oh, here's my program! Okay, good. [logs on the computer] Now, just in case he backed it up, I am going to delete everything from his hard drive.",
        "Frasier: Julia, I-I-I beg you to rethink this. I realize you're angry at Avery-",
        "Julia: I'm not feeling anger. Just the peace that comes with knowing that Avery will be royally screwed - by me.",
        "Sounds are heard outside the door.",
        "Frasier: There's somebody at the door!",
        "Julia points him to the closet. They rush in as someone outside is heard entering the code.",
        "RESET TO: Closet",
        "They go inside and close the door. Julia cracks the door and peeks outside, then closes the door softly.",
        "They both whisper:",
        "Julia: It's the cleaning woman. I thought so, I've hidden from her before.",
        "Frasier: Julia, there's still time to end this.",
        "Julia: Shh!",
        "Frasier: Look, you know that what you're doing is wrong. You should just get out now before more harm is done.",
        "Julia: Will you shut up? It's pointless to hide in a closet if the people outside can hear you!",
        "Frasier: You're going to get caught.",
        "Julia: Because you won't shut up!",
        "Frasier: It's never too late to do the right thing. No matter how low someone else sinks, joining them there does not make things better.",
        "Julia does not shush him. Suddenly she wraps her arms around his neck, and kisses him, closing her eyes. He is caught off guard, but reflexively returns the kiss and puts his arms around her...",
        "Outside, the door closes. She breaks away and exits back into the office. Frasier stands there, totally bewildered. He feels his lips for a moment as if to check to see if it really happened. Then he follows her into the office.",
        "RESET TO: Office The cleaning lady is gone, and Julia is back typing at the computer.",
        "Frasier: What was that?",
        "Julia: What?",
        "Frasier: You kissed me.",
        "Julia: I was trying to shut you up.",
        "Frasier: Oh, no. I've been kissed to shut me up before. This was not that.",
        "The computer beeps.",
        "Julia: Got it. All files deleted. [pause] You know, that didn't make me feel as good as I thought.",
        "Frasier: That's because you know you did the wrong thing.",
        "Julia shoves the contents of the desktop onto the floor, breaking the computer and scattering files.",
        "Julia: [happy] Ah, that's better. She runs out, followed by Frasier. End of Act One",
        "ACT TWO",

        "Scene Five - Caf\u00e9 Nervosa The caf\u00e9 is still packed. Frasier is seated at a table when Roz comes in.",
        "Roz: Well, it doesn't look like I'll be leaving KACL anytime soon. [crosses to the counter] Coffee to go, please?",
        "Frasier: Well... dear lord, what-what happened, Roz?",
        "Roz: [sits with him] Turns out the person who's interviewing me is a guy I've slept with.",
        "Frasier: What are the odds?",
        "Roz: [gives him a look, then] It was ten years ago, at a convention in Cancun. We were all hammered.",
        "Frasier: Oh, I'm surprised you even remember him.",
        "Roz: Well, it's hard to forget when you wake up with a nametag on your pillow that says, \"Hola! My name is Woody Wiswell.\"",
        "Frasier: So what's the problem?",
        "Roz: There's just something weird about it. I don't know, maybe I'm just freaking myself out because I'm not sure I'm ready for this job.",
        "Frasier: Well, of course you are, Roz. I mean, come on, don't doubt yourself. Listen, they're the ones that called you, right?",
        "Roz: Yeah.",
        "Frasier: You go down there and you get that job. You're going to make a great program director.",
        "Roz: You really think I will?",
        "Frasier: Of course I do. Even though... I wish you could stay with me forever. I'm going to miss you so much, Roz.",
        "Roz: [excited] Oh, stop it! I don't even have the job yet, you're gonna jinx it! [a waiter brings her coffee] Thank you. [to Frasier] Listen, I'd better go and get my presentation together so I can impress Woody Wiswell.",
        "Frasier: Seems to me you've impressed him already.",
        "As Roz leaves, she passes Julia, entering.",
        "Frasier: Julia-",
        "Julia: [quickly] Hello. [crosses to the counter] Can I have a latte to go, please?",
        "Frasier gets up and stands beside her.",
        "Frasier: Listen, Julia, Julia, I've been dying to talk to you all week long about what happened in Avery's office. Obviously something is going on, and I have several hypotheses. [Julia gets her coffee and starts adding sugar] It could be displaced passion, frustration from a failed relationship, or an adrenaline-induced action as a result of stress we were both suffering from...",
        "Julia: [finishes] Oh, Frasier, for once in your life, would you please shut up?",
        "She exits, passing Martin and Niles entering.",
        "Julia: Hello.",
        "Martin/Niles: Oh, hi./Hello.",
        "Frasier: Hi, guys.",
        "Niles: Hey, Frasier.",
        "Martin: Hey, Fras, you look a little down. Everything okay? [to a waiter] Uh, two coffees, please.",
        "Frasier: Dad, if you had any perspicacity whatsoever, you would know that this expression is merely ruminative perplexity.",
        "Martin: My bad.",
        "They sit.",
        "Frasier: It's nothing serious. I'll work it out.",
        "Niles: You know where I like to work things out? The shooting range.",
        "Frasier: Good Lord, Niles, are you still going down there? I thought you hated guns.",
        "Niles: Oh, believe me, I never expected I'd like it as much as I do. But when you're in that booth, focused on-on precision, and accuracy, it's not dissimilar to a kind of meditation. [Frasier looks intrigued] Wouldn't you agree, Dad?",
        "Martin: [shrugs] I just like to shoot stuff, son.",
        "Niles: Fair enough. [to Frasier] You should join us. There's a great bunch of guys I shoot with. I think you'd like them.",
        "Frasier: Well, I'm not sure I'd fit in with a bunch of trigger-happy gun nuts.",
        "Niles: Now, don't stereotype them. These are decent family men who enjoy marksmanship. It's a good group we've got. Dad and I are going down this afternoon.",
        "Martin: No, I don't think I'm going to come today, Niles.",
        "Niles: Well... it's Mitch's birthday.",
        "Martin: Well, I usually go shooting twice a year or so, and after this week I've had my fill. [the waiter brings their coffees] Thank you.",
        "Niles: Well, I'm still going. My shooting's getting better and better. Oh, plus the gun show's in town and the guys are bringing me passes.",
        "Frasier: A gun show? What's next, square dancing?",
        "Niles: Maybe. [raises his cup] This country was built by gun-totin' square dancers.",
        "Martin clinks his cup against Niles's.",

        "Scene Six - Woody Wiswell's Office Roz, dressed professionally in a suit, is seated in front of Woody Wiswell, a good-looking man with a permanent friendly smile.",
        "Roz: So, I really appreciate you bringing me in for this interview. I've been listening to your station for a while, and I've prepared a little presentation that I think will show you what I can bring to the KPXY family.",
        "Woody: Oh, that's not necessary. I mean, this is just a formality. Trust me, I know what you can do.",
        "Roz: [wary] Really?",
        "Woody: Yeah. I, uh, I already told the guys about you.",
        "Roz: What exactly did you tell them?",
        "Woody: Oh, you know - how incredible you are.",
        "Roz: Okay, look, I-I think there's something that needs to be said here. Why don't we just get it all out in the open? Yes, we slept together in Cancun, but I don't want that to affect the job. I mean, it was ten years ago, I...",
        "Woody: What are you talking about? Look, I think you have me mistaken for someone else.",
        "Roz: And I think I would remember a name like Woody Wiswell. I mean, seriously, whose named Woody Wiswell?",
        "Woody: Yeah, well, just me and my dad.",
        "His smile disappears as they both realize.",

        "Daphne: Darling, I just don't think you need an ankle holster when you don't even own a gun.",
        "Niles: Well, first of all, who says it's for me, Miss I-Never-Surprise- You-Anymore? And second of all, I'm thinking I might own a gun soon.",
        "Daphne: [firmly] No, you won't.",
        "Niles: No, no, no, don't worry. I, I would keep the gun in a locker at the shooting range. I would never have a gun in the same house as your mother.",
        "Martin comes over, looking disappointed.",
        "Martin: Now they're saying Daisy Duke might not get here. Niles pats him on the shoulder. Red, Mitch, and Wayne come over.",
        "Red: Hey, how's it going, kid?",
        "Niles: Hey, you guys, how are you? Oh, listen, I want you to meet my wife, Daphne. Daphne, this is Red, and Wayne, and Mitch. These are the guys I was telling you about.",
        "Daphne: Nice to meet you. [they ad-lib hellos]",
        "Red: Listen, kid, we've been talking it over, and since we get along so well at the club, we'd like to invite you down to our compound in Idaho for a weekend.",
        "For Martin and Daphne, this immediately sets off alarm bells.",
        "Niles: [thrilled] A compound? [to Martin and Daphne] It's just like the Kennedys! [to the guys] That sounds smashing.",
        "Red: Hey, that's the spirit.",
