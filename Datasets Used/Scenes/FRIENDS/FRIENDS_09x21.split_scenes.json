        "Monica: It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.",
        "Ross: Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!",
        "Chandler: I missed most of the party (pause) Charlie's a girl, right?",
        "Ross: Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did not kiss.",
        "Rachel: I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls at the party, GOD!",
        "Ross: Why do you care so much?",
        "Monica: Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?",
        "Rachel: (worried) Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know... and I... want him to hook up with lots of women! (pause) I just... All I'm saying is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.",
        "Ross: Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils...",
        "Phoebe: Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh, those nerds will get laaaaaid!",
        "Rachel: All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean...",
        "Ross: Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with it...",
        "(Joey and Charlie enter. Ross looks at her)",
        "Ross: Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was!",
        "Joey: Hey!",
        "All: Hi!",
        "Ross: I'm gonna get some more coffee.",
        "Charlie: Oh, you know what? I'll come with you!",
        "Ross: Ok. (they both go)",
        "Chandler: (to Joey) So, a professor, uh?",
        "Joey: Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious (which, being Joey, he mispronounces \"amonious\"). (pause) That's not how she used it...?",
        "Charlie: (talking to Ross) I feel like I owe you an explanation. I don't ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties. I'm... well, I'm kind of embarrassed. I really hope you don't think less of me.",
        "Ross: Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people.",
        "Charlie: You know, actually I'm a little surprised to myself. I mean, Joey is so different from the guys I usually date. I mean, they're all professors, and intellectuals, and paleontologists mostly, you know, very cerebral...",
        "Ross: Yeah, I know the type.",
        "Joey: Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious. No? Am I getting close?",

        "Phoebe: (entering) Hey!",
        "Monica: Hey!",
        "Phoebe: Hey you guys! Look what I just got. (she shows them a pair of slippers)",
        "Rachel: Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?",
        "Phoebe: I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania Twain.",
        "Rachel: (after a pause) Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!",
        "Phoebe: Oh... then I overpaid. (she goes to the bathroom)",
        "Monica: Hey, what's this?",
        "Rachel: Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO.",
        "Monica: Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage chains.",
        "Rachel: Ah, why, now I can't get a massage? There are so many things that she disapproves of! I can't eat veal, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting...",
        "Monica: Do you wanna go hunting?",
        "Rachel: Well, I would like to have the option!!",
        "Phoebe: (coming back from the bathroom) What's up? (she sees the gift certificate in Rachel's hands) Hey, Rachel!!",
        "Rachel: Oh!",
        "Phoebe: No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these \"big massage places\"! They're putting people like me out of business!",
        "Monica: And she wants to go hunting, too!!",
        "Rachel: Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing away a hundred bucks!",
        "Phoebe: Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It's about... it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.",
        "Rachel: I don't care about any of that!!",
        "Phoebe: Well, do you care about friendship?",
        "Rachel: Oh!",
        "Phoebe: I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend.",
        "Rachel: Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won't use it!",
        "Phoebe: Promise?",
        "Rachel: I promise.",
        "Phoebe: Thank you. (she tears up the gift certificate)",
        "Rachel: But I am going hunting!!",
        "[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment]",
        "Monica: (entering) Hey honey! I missed you today!",
        "Chandler: Oh, yeah?",
        "Monica: Yeah. (they kiss) What d'you wanna do tonight?",
        "Chandler: Oh, well... Maybe we could... (he sweeps the stuff off the table and wordlessly invites Monica to have s*x on it)",
        "Monica: Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience! Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank.",
        "Chandler: We really need to take those tests?",
        "Monica: Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.",
        "Chandler: But I don't wanna do it in a cup!",
        "Monica: What is the big deal?",
        "Chandler: It's weird! In a doctor's office?",
        "Monica: It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?",
        "Chandler: (embarrassed) I cannot believe Ross told you that! (pause) And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!",
        "Monica: Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think it's a good idea!",
        "Chandler: Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!",
        "Monica: (really embarrassed) OH!",
        "Chandler: Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!",
        "[Scene: Joey's apartment]",
        "Joey: (sipping red wine from a glass) Who says that wine has to cost more than milk!",
        "(somebody knocks the door, Joey opens and it's Charlie)",
        "Joey: Heeey!",
        "Charlie: Hi!",
        "Joey: Come on in, how are ya?",
        "Charlie: I'm good!",
        "Joey: Can I offer you a drink?",
        "Charlie: Please, I've been crazed all day! I had a meeting with the Dean, and my syllabus for summer school is due and I'm writing the Foreword for a friend's book...",
        "Joey: Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to open a door and go (looking scared) ohhhh!",
        "Charlie: So I am just so excited to be here. And I can't wait to start exploring the city!",
        "Joey: Hey, if you need a tour guide... (point to himself)",
        "Charlie: Oh, you mean it? That would be so fun!",
        "Joey: Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first?",
        "Charlie: Oh, well, we can go see the Chronos Quartet at the Avery Fisher Hall.",
        "Joey: (looking puzzled and nodding) Ok!",
        "Charlie: And there is a collection of Walt Whitman letters on display at the public library.",
        "Joey: I know, yeah!",
        "Charlie: And first, I have to see the MET!",
        "Joey: Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna see the Yankees.",
        "Charlie: No, no, no, not the Mets, the MET, singular!",
        "Joey: Which one, they all suck!",
        "Charlie: The museum!",
        "Joey: (looking puzzled) I don't think so.",

        "Rachel: (to the receptionist) Hi there!",
        "Receptionist: (in an affected tone) Hello, welcome to Lavender Day Spa SPA. How may I help you?",
        "Rachel: Oh, hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and here is my gift certificate.",
        "Receptionist: This has been torn up.",
        "Rachel: And... taped back together.",
        "Receptionist: Ok well, I'll call you as soon as your massage therapist is ready.",
        "Rachel: Ok",
        "Receptionist: Have a seat through the glass doors.",
        "Rachel: (imitating the receptionist's tone) through the glass doors.",
        "Receptionist: Through the glass doors.",
        "Rachel: Alright-y then.",
        "(Phoebe enters the hall)",
        "Receptionist: Phoebe, your next client's in the waiting room.",
        "Phoebe: Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around? (She sees Rachel) Oh, no, no! Listen, is there someone who can fill in for me?",
        "Receptionist: Sorry, everyone is booked!",
        "Phoebe: But that woman can't know I work here. She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this massage chains are.",
        "Receptionist: Then why you work here?",
        "Phoebe: 'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!",
        "Receptionist: Well, I think this is a great place to work!",
        "Phoebe: (watching around and whispering) Ok, are they listening?",
        "[Scene: Central Perk]",
        "(Joey walks in and moves towards Ross, who's sitting of the sofa)",
        "Joey: Ross!",
        "Ross: Hi!",
        "Joey: I need to talk to you about Charlie.",
        "Ross: (annoyed) Oh, do you, do you really?",
        "Joey: Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem.",
        "Ross: Look, if you don't know what the word \"acrimonious\" means, just don't use it!",
        "Joey: No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her body is soo...",
        "Ross: Get to the problem!",
        "Joey: Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!",
        "Ross: (looking down) Are you wearing two belts?",
        "Joey: (checking) EH, what do you know!",
        "Ross: You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.",
        "Joey: Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!",
        "Ross: You know, I really don't want to get involved in you guy's relationship.",
        "Joey: Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her.",
        "Ross: (after a short hesitation) Fine.",
        "Joey: Thanks.",
        "Ross: Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!",
        "Joey: The Metsss!",
        "Ross: Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.",
        "Joey: (realizing) Oh, that's what she meant! (pause) You know, if they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion!",
        "Ross: Yeah, most of it it's a place packed with confused angry baseball fans!",
        "Joey: Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.",
        "Ross: Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture, you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.",
        "Joey: Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!",
        "Ross: But I'm not! (pause). You know what if you're in the mood for Thai food...",
        "Joey: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?",
        "Ross: Ok.",
        "Joey: You got to tell me exactly what to do there.",
        "Ross: Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.",
        "Joey: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make the right (and he bends his arm to the left. Ross then bends Joey's arm to the right and Joey nods)",
        "[Scene: doctor's waiting room]",
        "Chandler: I have a weird feeling about this place. (pause) How do I know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.",
        "Monica: Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody is gonna wanna watch that.",
        "(a nurse walks in)",
        "Nurse: Mr. Bing? (Chandler jumps up) Here you are! You'll go into that room and deposit your specimen into the container.",
        "Chandler: Deposit my specimen? You know, usually I have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. Thanks, got it.",
        "Monica: Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going to be ok?",
        "Chandler: Yeah, I guess!",
        "Monica: I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even knows you!",
        "Janice: OH MY GOD!!",
        "Chandler: Oh, Come on!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janice: Ah ahahahhahaa! How great is this!",
        "Monica: Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!",
        "Chandler: Why are you here?",
        "Janice: Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time because apparently we...",
        "Chandler: (to Heaven) No no no... I mean, why? why is she here??",
        "Janice: Oh! Someone's a little cranky today cuz they have to do it in a cup! (laughs) Oh! They gave you the kiddy size (looking at the cup in his hand).",
        "Chandler: What!?",
        "(Janice does her \"Janice Laugh\")",
        "Monica: This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to! (leaves)",
        "Chandler: I'd love to stay, but I have eh... (points at the cup) got a hot date... (starts to leave)",
        "Janice: Please... go! (Then shouts after him) Just let me know if you need a hand!",
        "Chandler: (disgusted) I think it just fell off. (Leaves)",

        "Phoebe: (In a strange heavy accent) Hello \"ja\", it's time for your massage, ja! Put your face in the hole.",
        "Rachel: Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person. (Puts her head in the hole and Phoebe enters)",
        "Phoebe: Okay, then I'm Swedish...",
        "Monica: So, what's your name?",
        "Phoebe: It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea...",
        "Rachel: Oh... what an interesting name.",
        "Phoebe: Ja!",
        "Rachel: You know I... (lifts her head and tries to look in Phoebe's direction)",
        "Phoebe: (pushes her head back down) Time for your scalp massage!",
        "Rachel: (Sees Phoebe's slippers through the hole) Wow... I really love your... (startled as she realizes those are Phoebe's slippers)",
        "Phoebe: Is something wrong?",
        "Rachel: No, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea... (pause) Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden?",
        "Phoebe: (Thinks for a few moments) Uhm... Stockholm.",
        "Rachel: Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!",

        "[Scene: Joey's apartment, Joey and Ross in the living room, rehearsing what Joey will say to Charlie in the Museum]",
        "Joey: (gesturing at an imaginary painting) Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.",
        "Ross: Now, do you have any idea what you just said?",
        "Joey: (shaking his head as if to say: of course not!) No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!",
        "Ross: Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.",
        "Joey: Phonetically? (Looks confused)",
        "Ross: Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time for this.",
        "Joey: Ok.",
        "Ross: Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!",
        "Joey: Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on \"Days\" I had to say \"Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy\".",
        "Ross: Wow. What does that mean?",
        "Joey: No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means \"you're gonna get eaten by a bear\".",
        "Ross: Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?",
        "Joey: Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! (Reaches out to touch the imaginary painting).",
        "Ross: Nah ah! Nah ah! (stops him form doing so) No no no! No ad-libbing and dude, you can't touch the paintings.",
        "Joey: Come on! you... (reaches out to touch the imaginary painting again)",
        "Ross: No! (Slaps his hand)",
        "[Scene: The Fertility Clinic; Chandler walks out one of the rooms]",
        "Chandler: (To the nurse at the nurses' station) My specimen is in the room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. Really helped speed the process along! (walks towards the common area and sees Janice is still there) Janice! You're not... gone?",
        "Janice: Oh! Sid is still in his room. I don't allow p0rn at home so this is like a vacation for him. So did you do it? Did you make your deposit?",
        "Chandler: Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!",
        "Janice: That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?",
        "Chandler: I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.",
        "Janice: Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.",
        "Chandler: (Slightly panicky) Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?",
        "Janice: Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children. I am sure it's gonna be just fine.",
        "Chandler: (smiling again) oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'...",
        "Janice: What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you can't do it at a doctor's office?",
        "Chandler: (stares at her intently, then yells) It was a \"Wendy's!! \"",
        "[Scene: Phoebe and Rachel at the Spa. Phoebe is still massaging Rachel]",
        "Phoebe: (Singing) \"Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! \" And that is the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking! (looks annoyed)",

        "Phoebe: Oh, Ja! Ja!",
        "Rachel: Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though... (Phoebe looks devastated)",
        "Phoebe: Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?",
        "Rachel: I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar...",
        "Phoebe: Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass!",
        "Rachel: (now lifts her head) Phoebe!!",
        "Phoebe: You know it's me?",
        "Rachel: For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!",
        "Phoebe: How can you come here?",
        "Rachel: How could you not tell me you worked here?",
        "Phoebe: I don't have to tell you everything!",
        "Rachel: Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!",
        "Phoebe: Tips not included.",
        "Rachel: Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?",
        "Phoebe: Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know... you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh! paying taxes!",
        "Rachel: Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles and I so admire that! I don't have any!",
        "Phoebe: You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It's time I took my life back!",
        "Rachel: Good for you Pheebs!",
        "Phoebe: Ok.",
        "Phoebe: Okay (walks out and closes the door behind her, looks up and whispers) If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any of that. I love you.",

        "(Charlie walks in.)",
        "Ross: (recovers his composure and starts typing) Respectfully, professor R. Geller. (hits <return>, closes the laptop and joins Charlie on the sofa) Hey!",
        "Charlie: Hi!",
        "Ross: Hey, how was the Met?",
        "Charlie: The museum was amazing!",
        "Ross: Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?",
        "Charlie: Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to say, and some of it didn't even make any sense.",
        "Ross: What do you mean?",
        "Charlie: Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around.",
        "Ross: (perplexed for a moment) Wait a minute... when you guys walked into the Met, did you go to the right?",
        "Charlie: No, we went to the left.",
        "Ross: (shaking head) Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, it's fun (hesitating).",
        "Ross: What?",
        "Charlie: Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really know me that well; it would be weird.",
        "Ross: What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.",
        "Charlie: Well... I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common with. You know what I mean?",
        "Ross: (slowly) Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, I guess that's true.",
        "Ross: And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.",
        "Charlie: He is very sweet. Plus he's hot!",
        "Ross: That was going to be my next argument.",
