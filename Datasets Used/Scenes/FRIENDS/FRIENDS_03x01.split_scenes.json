Chandler, back together with Janice, wants Joey to bond with her, a seemingly impossible request. To remedy the situation, Janice insists she and Joe spend a fun day together, convinced at the end that Joey now likes her. Joey later admits to Chandler that he still cannot stand Janice, but says that they both survived the day without incident, which is enough to satisfy Chandler."

        "Joey: No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. (walks into the kitchen, Chandler follows closely, he turns around and gets startled). Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair (holds his hands up to signify she has big hair)?",

        "Chandler: I want you to say that you like her!",
        "Joey: I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna (grimaces and tenses up) pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.",
        "Chandler: Thanks for trying. (grabs the ticket and starts to leave) Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!",

        "Ross: Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.",
        "Rachel: Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.",
        "Ross: That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.",
        "Rachel: Were both of those Joey?",
        "Ross: Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.",
        "Rachel: Not even with your best friend.",
        "Ross: Noo!",
        "Rachel: That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.",

        "Monica: Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?",
        "Phoebe: All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....",
        "Monica: I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.",
        "Phoebe: All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....",

        "Monica: I think so.",
        "Mr. Geller: Honey, relationships are hard. Like with your Mom and me. You know after we graduated college we broke up for a while. It seems her Father, your Grandfather, wanted her to travel around Europe, like he did. Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam's nickel, because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time. However, (turns around and sees that Monica is sleeping and puts a blanket around her, kisses her, picks up the cigar, and starts watching the video)",
