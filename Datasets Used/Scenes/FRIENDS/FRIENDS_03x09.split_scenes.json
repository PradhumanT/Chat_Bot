        "The Guys: We will. (they don't move)",
        "Monica: Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.",
        "Rachel: No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.",

        "Phoebe: Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. (just as she sits down).",
        "Ross: Halftime.",
        "Joey: Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?",
        "Rachel: Oh! That would be sooo much fun!",
        "Phoebe: Oh, can I play too? I've never played football, like ever.",
        "Joey: Great, you can cover Chandler.",
        "Chandler: No, no, no, I don't, I don't really wanna play.",
        "Joey: Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.",
        "Chandler: That's not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don't say that I don't have goals!",
        "Joey: Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice, and if you don't play, everyone will be mad at you 'cause the teams won't be even. Come on.",
        "Chandler: Yeah, all right, I'll play.",
        "Phoebe: Yay!!",

        "Ross: Um, Monica and I aren't supposed to play football.",
        "Joey: Says who? Your mom?",
        "Monica and Ross: Yeah.",
        "Monica: Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the 'Geller Bowl.'",
        "Chandler: No, no, no, you say that proudly.",
        "Monica: Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind've competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross's nose.",
        "Ross: It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.",
        "Monica: To score the winning touchdown, by the way.",
        "Ross: Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn't count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.",
        "Monica: (to Chandler and Joey) I won the game.",
        "Ross: Oh yeah! Then how come you didn't get the Geller Cup?",
        "Rachel: Um, there was a Geller Cup?",
        "Ross: Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, 'nobody won that game, ' and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and.... (pauses to collect himself, as he is on the verge of tears saying this) threw it in the lake.",
        "Chandler: And was the curse lifted?",
        "Ross: Anyway. That's when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.",
        "Monica: Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it's been twelve years.",
        "Ross: Can I see you for a second?",

        "Rachel: Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.",
        "Ross: Here you go. (throws her the ball)",
        "Rachel: (knocking it down instead of catching it) That almost hit me in the face.",
        "Joey: All right, we have to pick captains.",
        "Chandler: And then Tineals.",
        "Phoebe: Okay, so how do we decide that?",
        "Monica: Well, why don't we just bunny up.",
        "Rachel, Chandler, and Joey: What?",
        "Monica and Ross: (holding both of their hands above their heads making rabbit ears with their fingers.) Bunny!",
        "Monica: Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.",
        "Joey: Thank you.",
        "Rachel: Monica, I'm your best friend.",

        "Phoebe: Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler?",
        "Monica: Okay, Phoebe you know what you're doing right?",
        "Phoebe: Yeah.",
        "Monica: Okay, Joey's gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block.",
        "Phoebe: What's block?",
        "Monica: Phoebe, I thought you said you know what you're doing?",
        "Phoebe: I thought you meant in life.",
        "Monica: Break.",
        "(Chandler is getting ready to kick off, Ross is holding the ball between his foot and finger.)",

        "Chandler: No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.",
        "[cut to later, Ross's team has the ball.]",
        "Chandler: (coming up under center, just like a real quarterback does, and puts his hands between Ross's legs.) Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!! (Ross stands up and looks at him) You wanna go shotgun?",

        "Phoebe: Woo-yay!!",
        "Monica: No! Listen, I'm not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can't blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let's just call this, tie score and it's halftime.",
        "Ross: Okay, first of all, I don't play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!!",
        "Monica: Y'know what? I'll think you'll play.",
        "Ross: Oh really! Why is that?",

        "(Ross makes a 'Yeah. Right.' sound.)",
        "Monica: Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I'll prove it to you, okay. I'll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game.",
        "Ross: What?! The guys against the girls? See, that's ridiculous Monica, because I'm only down by three touchdowns.",
        "Monica: Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.",
