        "Ross: Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?",
        "Monica: Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.",
        "Rachel: I didn't know there were docks.",
        "[Joey and Chandler enter]",
        "Joey: Hey.",
        "Chandler: Hey.",
        "Ross: Aww, is it broken?",
        "Joey: No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks. (points to the sling he is wearing)",
        "Rachel: Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?",
        "Joey: Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.",
        "Chandler: Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.",
        "Joey: What is this? Fruit?",
        "Rachel: Monica's making jam.",
        "Joey: Whoa, jam! I love jam! (to Chandler) Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?",
        "Chandler: Because the kids need new shoes.",
        "Monica: I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. (sees Joey trying some jam from the pot) Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot. (Joey realizes this and spits what he had in his mouth back into the pot.)",
        "Joey: This will just be my batch.",

        "Guy: Wh..",
        "Phoebe: Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.",
        "Guy: Oh, that's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus!",
        "Phoebe: Oh, you're not a dingus.",
        "Guy: I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones.",
        "Phoebe: Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay.",
        "Guy: Well thanks. (starts to leave)",
        "Phoebe: Wait, (grabs him) you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?",
        "Guy: Not really.",
        "Phoebe: Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay.",
        "Guy: Wait. You're right. I know you're right. And, thanks for being so nice. Here (gives her the flowers he bought.)",
        "Phoebe: Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?",
        "Guy: Yeah, okay.",
        "Phoebe: Okay. (they start to leave, he is still following her) Okay, you don't have to walk behind me any more.",

        "Rachel: What?",
        "Ross: Look, look, look.",
        "Rachel: What, what, what?",
        "Ross: It's an empty apartment.",
        "Rachel: Oooh.",
        "Ross: We're all alone in an empty apartment.",
        "Rachel: Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes (Ross starts kissing her neck) Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything. (they fall onto the couch)",
        "(Chandler enters and they both jump up and pretend that Ross is showing her something in the couch.)",
        "Ross: There it is.",
        "Rachel: Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. (to Chandler) Hey.",
        "Ross: Hey.",
        "Chandler: Do I look fat?",
        "Ross and Rachel: Noo.",
        "Chandler: Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.",
        "Rachel: Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.",
        "Chandler: Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....",
        "Ross: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?",
        "Rachel: Nooo!",
        "Ross: And it works both ways.",
        "Chandler: Okay, so you both just know this stuff?",
        "Rachel: Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.",
        "Ross: Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?",
        "Chandler: That's easy, baggage claim.",
        "Ross: (buzzes) Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.",
        "Chandler: Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.",
        "Rachel: Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers. (Chandler makes an 'Ewww' face) Okay, I'm late for work.",
        "Ross: Oh.",
        "Rachel: All right are you guys gonna come down?",
        "Ross: Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.",
        "Rachel: Good luck Chandler.",
        "Chandler: Thank you Rachel.",
        "Ross: Bye sweetie.",
        "Rachel: Bye hon.",
        "Ross: (blows her a kiss) Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.",
        "Chandler: Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.",
        "Ross: Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here. (they sit on the couch and Ross puts his hands on Chandler's shoulder and thigh.) Okay, you're in bed...",
        "Chandler: Yeah. (they both notice where his hands are)",
        "Ross: I'm gonna use the cushion.",
        "Chandler: Yeah.",
        "Ross: Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her (demonstrates on the cushion) and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.",
        "Chandler: Okay, the old hug and roll.",
        "Ross: Yep.",
        "Chandler: Okay, one question.",
        "Ross: Shoot.",
        "Chandler: You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?",
        "[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is putting jam on his muffin, lots of jam]",
        "Joey: Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?",
        "Rachel: (Looks at him) You're so pretty.",
        "Phoebe: (entering) Hi!",
        "All: Hey, Phoebe.",
        "Phoebe: Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.",
        "Joey: (with food in his mouth) You talked to him. Are you crazy?",
        "Phoebe: Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.",
        "Chandler: Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.",
        "Phoebe: Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.",
        "Ross: Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.",
        "Phoebe: No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.",
        "Joey: (with his mouthful) Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean (he sprays Phoebe with crumbs)",
        "Phoebe: Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather.",
        "Monica: (entering) Hey guys.",
        "All: Hey Mon.",
        "Monica: Joey, this is for you. (gives him a jar of jam) It's blackberry curin.",
        "Joey: Aww. (tastes it) Ohh!",
        "Chandler: Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked (holds up one hand), or, or a big tub of jam. (holds up the other hand)",
        "Joey: Put your hands together.",
        "Monica: Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.",
        "Joey: No more jam?!",
        "Rachel: Well, what happened to your jam plan?",
        "Monica: I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.",
        "Chandler: Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.",
        "Ross: What are you talking about?",
        "Monica: I'm talking about me having a baby.",
        "Ross: What?",
        "Rachel: Are you serious?",
        "Monica: Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan.",
        "Ross: Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!",
        "Monica: It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.",
        "Chandler: That, that's what's stupid.",
        "Monica: I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.",
        "Rachel: Down at the docks again?",
        "[Scene: Chandler's bedroom, Janice and him are cuddling]",
        "Janice: Night-night Bing-a-ling.",
        "Chandler: Night-night.....Janice. (he starts thinking to him self) 'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom! (his one arm is still under her) Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!' (Pulls his arm out from under her and she is spun off of the bed.)",

        "Phoebe: Oh, yeah. What's this? (picks up a book)",
        "Malcom: Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you wanna here something from it?",
        "Phoebe: Um, not even a little bit.",
        "Malcom: It's about you.",
        "Phoebe: Oh, okay then.",
        "Malcom: (reading) I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me eventhough I'm such a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird, but kinda cool.",
        "Phoebe: Good. So what were you thinking?",
        "Malcom: I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you.",
        "Phoebe: Really?",
        "Malcom: No.",
        "Phoebe: Oh.",

        "Chandler: You mean there's more than one of us.",
        "Ross: Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna.....",
        "Monica: You're gonna what?",
        "Ross: I'm gonna tell Mom.",
        "Rachel: Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy.",
        "Ross: Crazy.",
        "Monica: What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something....",
        "Ross: (interrupting her) Oh, it's not the ideal way...",
        "Monica: Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?",
        "Joey: Check it out!! Jam crackers!",
        "Monica: Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. (they all turn and look at Joey) Oh my God, under personal comments: 'New York Knicks, rule!'",

        "Chandler: And that's how you bought it?",
        "Joey: Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.",
        "Monica: Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.",
