Ross learns Emily is engaged again, and has a one-night stand with someone the group is all too familiar with, Janice. Later, Janice breaks up with Ross, unable to stand his perpetual whining. Ross asks Chandler to forgive him for sleeping with his ex, believing it breaks a friendship rule.

        "[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is trying to pry more information about Chandler and Monica from Joey who's sitting on the couch and busy downing a pizza.]",
        "Rachel: Come on Joey!!!",
        "Joey: Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.",
        "Rachel: I can't believe you would say that!",
        "Joey: Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.",
        "Rachel: No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal! (She sits next to him on the couch.) Fine I want-I need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?",
        "Joey: (thinks) I don't know.",
        "Rachel: Is he romantic with her?",
        "Joey: I don't know.",
        "Rachel: Are they in love?",

        "Chandler: Did they teach you that in your anger management class?",
        "Phoebe: Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase?",
        "Rachel: Pheebs, I don't think anyone's mad about that.",
        "Phoebe: Exactly! Because it's in the past!",
        "Joey: (eyeing the flattened scone) Anybody gonna eat that?",

        "Chandler: Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!",
        "Monica: Really?",
        "Chandler: And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. (She glares at him.) Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.",
        "Monica: Hey, I thought you already had one.",
        "Chandler: Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at...bigger rocks. (He starts to leave and stops an entering Rachel.) Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?",

        "Rachel: Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you?",
        "Monica: Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.",

        "Monica: Okay, what's going on with you?",
        "Rachel: Nothing! You go!",
        "Monica: Well, I-I-there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore.",
        "Rachel: Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, (checks watch) y'know what though Mon, I actually do have a lot of work to do so if-if-are you sure there's just not anything else?",
        "Monica: Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?",

        "Chandler: Long! (Gives Monica the Work Laugh.)",
        "[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Chandler are returning from the game.]",
        "Monica: I can't believe you let them win!",

        "Joey: What?!",
        "Phoebe: Are you serious?!",
        "Ross: Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me. I mean I talked for hours. (Joey has lost interest and is watching the race again.) It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.",

        "Chandler: So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?",
        "Monica: I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.",
        "Chandler: Oh. (Does a double take when he realizes what she just said.)",
        "Doug: (entering) Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself. (Chandler does not laugh.) Did you hear what I said Bing?",
