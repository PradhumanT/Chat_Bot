        "Phoebe: ...sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle; and away they all flew like the down of a thistle; but I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, \"Merry Christmas to all, and to all a goodnight!\"",
        "Joey: (impressed) Wow, that was great! You really wrote that?",
        "Phoebe: (smiling) Uh-huh.",
        "Chandler: (coming from the bedroom) Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa.",
        "Monica: I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas.",
        "Ross: You're really not coming back?",
        "Chandler: Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don't get it done, I'll be fired.",
        "Monica: It's so unfair, you don't even like your job!",
        "Chandler: So, who does?",

        "Wendy: Hey!",
        "Others: Hey.",
        "Chandler: Hey. Where've you been?",
        "Wendy: I was, uh, checking out that insurance company's Christmas party on three, oh, it was really beautiful, they have all these decorations and this huge tree and I just, uh... to hell with them, we have to work. -- So I stole ther ham. (She turns the cardboard box upside down over the conference table, a big piece of ham falls out.)",
        "Chandler: (to the others) You hear that? You may not be with your familys, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here.",
        "Claudia: My kid's in a play right now.",
        "Chandler: Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up! (he starts spreading envelopes among them) I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order.",
        "Nick: (reading off his card) \"A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet\".",
        "Chandler: Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!",
        "Wendy: *Now* it feels like Christmas.",
        "Chandler: I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your familys tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to.",
        "Nick: You can come to my house!",
        "Chandler: Haha, no thanks!",

        "(singing) \"Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap. Asked him to bring my friends all kinds of crap. Said all you need is to write them a song. Now, you haven't heard it yet, so don't try to sing along. No, don't sing along.",

        "Phoebe: Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.",
        "Rachel: We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.",
        "Chandler: What? That's terrible!",
        "Phoebe: No-no, we do it every year!",
        "Chandler: Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.",
        "Phoebe: No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us, that wily... minx.",
        "Rachel: Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?",
        "Chandler: No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!",
        "Phoebe: Oh no, we have to!",
        "Chandler: No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too.",

        "Chandler: Why?",
        "Rachel: Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?",
        "Chandler: No, I have a great idea for a present for her.",
        "Phoebe: Oh, that's it? (Mimics Chandler) A great idea! Oh yeah.",
        "Rachel: Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?",
        "Chandler: If I help, we can find 'em faster!",
        "Rachel: That's right!",
        "(Phoebe looks under the couch)",

        "Rachel: Oh.",
        "Phoebe: Ooh, who's it for?",
        "Rachel: (Reading from a tag that's attached to the shoe) \"Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch?",

        "Joey: No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.",
        "Chandler: OK, Pheebs, your turn.",
        "Phoebe: Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?",

        "Ross: What are you doing here, Santa?",
        "Chandler: Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?",
        "Ross: I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?",
        "Chandler: What?",
        "Monica: Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence I'd never thought I'd say.",
        "(They walk to the kitchen; everyone is lowering their voices)",
        "Ross: (to Chandler) What are you doing?",
        "Chandler: You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!",
        "Ross: Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave.",

        "Wendy: Huh? Really? -- Hm, that'd be so terrible? (She gets hold of Chandler's tie, slowly moving her hands upwards on the tie, getting closer and closer to him, seductive.)",
        "Chandler: This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie.",

        "Wendy: (laughs) ...Missy?",
        "Chandler: I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ... (She lets go of his tie) Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?",
        "Wendy: You are to me... (She gets closer again, putting her arms around his waist/chest.)",
        "Chandler: (flattered) No,... no... (realizing) NO! (He quickly gets several steps away from her.) Look, I'm, I'm married!",
        "Wendy: So? I'm married. (Showing him the ring on her finger.)",
        "Chandler: I'm *happily* married.",
        "Wendy: Oh. What's *that* like?",
        "Chandler: Right. So, I'm sorry...",
        "Wendy: Seriously? Happily married. So that phone call before, that was ... happy?",
        "Chandler: Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... You know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. Look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us.",
        "Wendy: Okay, let me ask you something: if what you and your wife have is so great, then why are you spending Christmas with me?",
        "(Chandler starts to think about it...)",

        "Chandler: You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms...",
        "(She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?",
        "Monica: Well, not anymore.",
        "Chandler: But we don't do that.",
        "Monica: I know, I just thought it would be fun.",
        "Chandler: How drunk are you?",
        "Monica: Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.",
        "Chandler: (thinks) That's the perfect amount!",
        "Monica: Okay!",
        "(They run to the bed, sit down, and start making out again.)",
        "Monica: (breaking the kiss) Y'know what's weird?",

        "Chandler: Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing s*x and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this.",

        "Monica: You do?!",
        "Chandler: Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do.",
        "Monica: Oh, you're so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?",

Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.",
