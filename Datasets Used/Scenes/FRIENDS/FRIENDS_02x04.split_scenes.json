        "PHOEBE: Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card.",
        "MONICA: I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.",
        "PHOEBE: I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve.",
        "MONICA: Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?",
        "ROSS: You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental.",
        "PHOEBE: OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend.",
        "MONICA: Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.",

        "MONICA: What have I not told you?",
        "PHOEBE: Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having s*x with Fun Bobby out on the terrace.",
        "RACHEL: What!",
        "MONICA: Wait a minute, who told you? [turns to Chandler who's looking sheepish] You are dead meat.",
        "CHANDLER: I didn't know it was a big secret.",
        "MONICA: Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple.",
        "PHOEBE: You have a third nipple?",
        "CHANDLER: You bitch.",
        "ROSS: Whip it out, whip it out.",
        "CHANDLER: C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.",
        "RACHEL: Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?",
        "JOEY: I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.",
        "ROSS: Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?",
        "JOEY: I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again.",

        "JOEY: Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' s*x on it.",
        "MONICA: That is wild.",
        "ROSS: [to Chandler] So what's it shaped like?",
        "PHOEBE: Yeah, is there a hair on it?",
        "JOEY: What happens if you flick it?",
        "[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler, Ross, and Julie are sitting on the couch.]",
        "ROSS: So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?",
        "CHANDLER: Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.",
        "JULIE: You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you.",
        "CHANDLER: Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?",
        "ROSS: You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?",
        "RACHEL: [to Monica at the counter] Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.",
        "MONICA: Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.",

        "CHANDLER: No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.",
        "MONICA: I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.",
        "PHOEBE: OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.",
        "ROSS: [holding cream pitcher] Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. [holds pitcher in front of Chandler's chest and flips the lid] Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?",
        "CHANDLER: Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . .",

        "ROSS: Technically, huh, no.",
        "RACHEL: Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?",
        "ROSS: No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .",

        "ROSS: What?",
        "RACHEL: I think it's sexy.",
        "ROSS: Sexy?",
        "RACHEL: Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have s*x.",
        "ROSS: No kidding?",
        "RACHEL: Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do?",
        "ROSS: What?",
        "RACHEL: I'd wait.",
        "ROSS: You'd wait?",
        "RACHEL: Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more.",
        "ROSS: Really?",
        "RACHEL: Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have s*x with, with another man. That just means it's working.",

        "DUNCAN: I know, that's what I kept telling myself but you just reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore.",
        "PHOEBE: So how long have you known?",
        "DUNCAN: Well I guess on some level I always knew I was straight. I though I was supposed to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was just tryin' to fit in.",

        "ROSS: Really?",
        "RACHEL: Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen.",
        "ROSS: [being drawn in by her talk] Uh-huh.",
        "RACHEL: And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening.",
