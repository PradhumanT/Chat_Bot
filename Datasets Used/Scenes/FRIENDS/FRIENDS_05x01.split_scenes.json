        "Rachel: Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, \"I take thee circus freak.\" Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right?",
        "Ross: No! No! Of course it didn't mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y'know, because-because it was you...",

        "Ross: Oh, right!",
        "Rachel: Get the hell out of there, y'know?",
        "(They all start laughing, and quickly stop when they realize what she just said and run over to the bathroom.)",
        "Ross: (Bangs on the bathroom door) Emily? Emily? I'm coming in. (He opens the door to reveal that the window is gone, along with Emily.)",
        "Rachel: Well, look at that, same thing.",
        "[Scene: London Marriott, Monica and Chandler are walking to her room.]",
        "Chandler: Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, \"Yippee!\" just ignore me.",

        "Monica: Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!",
        "Chandler: Oh, hello Rachel.",
        "Rachel: Ross said my name. Okay? My name. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me! (They both just stare at her.) Okay, don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?",
        "Chandler: Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.",
        "Monica: Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?",

        "Monica: Great...",
        "Rachel: Hi!",
        "Phoebe: Hi, so what happened?",
        "Rachel: Well, Ross said my name.",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything.",
        "Rachel: Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then...",
        "Chandler: (To Monica) Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?",
        "Monica: But my clothes are-ohh! (They both leave.)",
        "(Cut to Chandler's room, he opens the door slowly to see if Joey is there and after seeing that he isn't, ushers Monica into the room, closes the door, and the security bar.)",
        "Chandler: Wow, you look...",
        "Monica: No time for that!",

        "Chandler: Well, we're-we're hanging out in here!",
        "Joey: Look, which one of us is gonna be having s*x in there, me or you?",
        "Chandler: Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie in here?",
        "Monica: Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's My Giant!",
        "Joey: My Giant? I love that movie!",
        "[Scene: Ross and Emily's room, Chandler and Monica are still looking for a place to do the deed.]",
        "Monica: You really think this is okay?",
        "Chandler: Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.",
        "Monica: Oh, it's so beautiful. Ohh! Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this.",
        "Chandler: Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects s*x. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get s*x. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.",
        "Monica: Okay!",
        "Chandler: Okay!",
        "(They both run to rip the covers off the bed, but are interrupted by Ross.)",

        "Chandler: Nope, not under here!",
        "Monica: You didn't find her?",
        "Ross: No, I've looked everywhere!",
        "Chandler: Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!",
        "Monica: Yeah, I think you should keep looking!",
        "Chandler: Yeah, for about 30 minutes.",
        "Monica: Or 45.",
        "Chandler: Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice. (Monica smiles at that.)",
        "Ross: No! For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place. (He sits down on the bed.) Right here.",
        "Monica: Well, it's getting late.",
        "Chandler: Yeah, we're gonna go.",
        "Ross: Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?",
        "Monica: Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.",
        "Chandler: Yeah, it's a very large plane.",
        "Ross: (disappointed) That's cool.",
        "Chandler: But, we'll stay here with you.",
        "Ross: Thanks guys! (They both sit down on either side of him.) I really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt.",

        "Chandler: We have to leave for New York in an hour.",
        "Monica: I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?",
        "Chandler: We can't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it.",
        "(They both try to slowly extricate themselves from Ross, but there's a knock on the door that awakens him.)",
        "Ross: Em-Emily? (Looking around for her.) Em-Emily? (He runs to the door.) Emily! (He opens the door to reveal the Walthams standing outside.)",
        "Mr. Waltham: No.",
        "Mrs. Waltham: You can forget about Emily, she's not with us.",
        "Mr. Waltham: We've come for her things.",
        "Ross: Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?",
        "Mr. Waltham: She's in hiding. She's utterly humiliated. She doesn't want to see you ever again.",
        "Mrs. Waltham: We're very sad that it didn't work out between you and Emily, monkey. But, I think you're absolutely delicious.",
        "Mr. Waltham: Excuse me, I'm standing right here!",
        "Mrs. Waltham: Oh yes, there you are.",
        "Rachel: (entering, carrying an armful of those little soaps.) Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside... (Sees the Walthams and stops.)",
        "Mr. Waltham: Goodbye Geller.",
        "Ross: Now, hold on! Hold on! (Stops him) Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all! (Rachel sits down, depressed.) That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.",
        "Mr. Waltham: All right, I'll tell her. (To his wife) Come on bugger face!",
        "Mrs. Waltham: (As she walks pass Ross, she pats his but.) Call me.",

        "Monica: Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again.",
        "Chandler: Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. (Realizes something) Y'know, technically we still are over international waters.",
        "Monica: I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?",
        "Chandler: 'Kay!",
        "(Monica gets up and heads for the bathroom, Chandler turns to watch her go and is startled to see Joey sitting in Monica's seat.)",
        "Joey: Can I ask you something?",
        "Chandler: Uhh, no.",
        "Joey: Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, \"I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant.\" Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?",
        "Chandler: No.",
        "Joey: I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?",

        "Joey: Thanks man.",
        "Chandler: Okay man. (Chandler starts to get up.)",
        "Joey: But what about how much taller he is than me?",
        "(Time lapse, Chandler is finishing his third little bottle of booze.)",
        "Joey: I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?",
        "(Monica returns.)",
        "Joey: Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.",

        "Phoebe: This pregnancy is throwing me all off.",
        "Joey: All right, I'm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.",
        "Phoebe: Oh, me too!",
        "Joey: Why would you need to say hi to them, you've been feeding them for four days?",
        "Phoebe: Oh right, maybe I'll just go home.",

        "Monica: Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.",
        "Chandler: Oh. Y'know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me 'cause, you're really hot! Is that okay?",
        "Monica: (laughs) That's okay.",
        "Chandler: And I'm cute too.",
        "Monica: And you're cute too.",

        "Rachel: Yeah. I'm sorry.",
        "Ross: I just, I don't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y'know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she'd actually show up?",
        "Rachel: No, you're not an idiot, Ross. You're a guy very much in love.",
        "Ross: Same difference.",
