    "Recap": [
        "Phoebe tries to teach Joey how to speak French for a play. Rachel's dad has a heart attack, so she goes to Long Island, accompanied by Ross, to visit him, which leads Rachel to want sympathy sex with Ross, but he turns her down since he thinks it's not a good idea. Rachel, the next morning, becomes mad at Ross because of this and he says they should never have sex again, saying it's \"off the table\". Back in the city, Rachel again thanks Ross for coming with her and the two comment about their history of sleeping together. Rachel says for her and Ross, it's \"never off the table\", confusing him and he leaves. Meanwhile, Erica , the birth mother, comes for a visit and reveals that the father of her baby may be a shovel killer, which is not the case as the father is another guy she slept with."

        "Rachel: Ross...",
        "Ross: No, no, no, I'm sure you have a great excuse, wh-was it a hair appointment, a mani-pedi or was there a sale at Barney's?",

        "Ross: Ok, ok. I'm gonna come out to Long Island with you, I mean, you can't be alone right now.",
        "Rachel: No, come on, I'm totally ok. (hugging him) I don't need you to come! I can totally handle this on my own.",
        "Ross: Still-still, let me come... for me.",
        "Rachel: Ok. If you really need to.",
        "Ross: I bet someone could use one of Monica's freshly baked cookies.",

        "Ross: Ok, well, uh, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or...(There's one of those moments. They're staring at each other, no word uttered, and then she leans toward him in order to kiss him, but he ducks and avoids her more than once.) Oh, oh. (he then hugs her and when she tries to kiss him again, he stands up and she falls down on the bed). No, Rach! I'm sorry, I just don't think this, this, this is a good idea.",
        "Rachel: Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we?",
        "Ross: No, look, uh. You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel it would be right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you.",
        "Rachel: Taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!",
        "Ross: Look, I'm sure it would be great, but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I'm gonna go!",
        "Rachel: Wow. Ok.",
        "Ross: I'll see you in the morning (he leaves).",
        "Rachel: Mhm-mh!",

        "Monica: Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming.",
        "Chandler: (enters the room wearing an \"I love New York\" t-shirt, a \"Statue of Liberty\" hat and carrying bags) New York is awesome!",
        "Monica: What is with you?",
        "Chandler: Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know.",
        "Monica: Yeah, you miss alot, when you're moo-ing.",
        "Erica: Thanks so much for showing me around.",
        "Monica: Oh! It was our pleasure. We are so much enjoying getting to know you.",
        "Erica: Well, if there is anything else you wanna know... (Monica and Chandler look at each other)",
        "Chandler: Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?",
        "Erica: Oh, sure. Yeah, well, he was my high school boyfriend. Captain of the football team, really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college. (Monica and Chandler are smiling from ear to ear)",
        "Chandler: That's great.",
        "Erica: Yeah... it's almost definitely him. (Monica and Chandler look confused now)",
        "Monica: How's that now?",
        "Erica: Well, there is a chance it's another guy. I mean, I have only ever been with two guys, but they sorta overlapped.",
        "Chandler: So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?",
        "Erica: No, he's in prison. (More shocked looks from Monica and Chandler)",
        "Monica: Was he falsely accused of something? (They look hopeful)",
        "Erica: No... he killed his father with a shovel. (Monica and Chandler's jaws drop) But other than that, he's a great guy.",
        "Chandler: I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.",
        "(Time lapse. Chandler and Monica are in bed now)",
        "Monica: Are you awake?",
        "Chandler: Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake! (He turns the light on)",
        "Monica: Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy.",
        "Chandler: Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.",
        "Monica: Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?",
        "Chandler: I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is.",
        "Monica: How?",
        "Chandler: I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?",
        "Monica: Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting.",
        "Chandler: Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says \"mom\" on his shovel-wielding arm!",

        "Phoebe: Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday and I thought about it a lot and, and I know, I was too impatient. SO lets try it again.",
        "Joey: Oh, no, that's okay, I don't need your help. I worked on it myself and I gotta say, I am pretty good!",
        "Phoebe: Really, can I hear some of it.",
        "Joey: Sure, sure. Ok, (clears his throat and starts to read from his script. He starts talking in a fake French accent, making gestures with his hands) \"Bleu de la bleu, de la blu bla bleu\" (Phoebe looks astonished, annoyed and disgusted, Joey seems very proud though) See?",
        "Phoebe: Well, you're not, (she tries to smile and contain her anger, but loses it) You're not... you're not... again, you're not SPEAKING FRENCH!",
        "Joey: (offended) Oh well I think I am, yeah and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part.",
        "Phoebe: How could you possibly think that?",
        "Joey: For one thing, the guy on the tape said I was doing a good job!",

        "Ross: You've been quiet all morning. Is everything okay?",
        "Rachel: Hmm-hmm. (starts to pour herself a cup of coffee, never looking at Ross)",

        "Rachel: In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy s*x... just do it. (she smiles fakely at him)",
        "Ross: (half amused) Wait, wait, (looks around a little) You're mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing.",
        "Rachel: (sarcastically) Really? Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!",

        "Rachel: Oh stop that!",
        "Ross: I can't believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding.",

        "Rachel: Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either. (She turns to leave and Ross over takes her and stands infront on her, his back to the row of doors leading to the hospital rooms)",
        "Ross: Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having s*x again.",
        "Rachel: What?",
        "Ross: That's right, s*x is off the table. (The door starts to open behind him and Dr. Green emerges) I am never having s*x with you again.

        "Chandler: How do you know?",
        "Erica: Well, it turns out that Erica didn't pay much attention in s*x Ed class, because the thing she did with that prison guy... it'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way.",
