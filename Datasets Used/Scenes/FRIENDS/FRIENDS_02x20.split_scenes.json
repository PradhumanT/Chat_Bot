        "RACHEL: Then what's gonna happen?",
        "ROSS: Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.",
        "RACHEL: Uh-huh.",
        "ROSS: Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.",
        "RACHEL: Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.",
        "ROSS: Huh?",
        "RACHEL: I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this [hands back Ben] and um, I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot. I don't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a door? [leaves]",

        "MONICA: Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other.",
        "RICHARD: Oh, no, honey, I mean, don't worry, I like hanging out with those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow?'",
        "MONICA: Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.",
        "RICHARD: Uh, it's the college playoffs.",
        "MONICA: Oh, then go Vassar.",

        "RICHARD: Ok. [leaves]",
        "MONICA: Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.",
        "PHOEBE: Sure.",
        "MONICA: It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?",
        "PHOEBE: Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.",
        "RACHEL: [enters] Aghh.",

        "MONICA: I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.",
        "RACHEL: Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.",
        "MONICA: Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.",
        "ROSS: [enters] Ok, what the hell happened back there?",
        "RACHEL: I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.",
        "ROSS: Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.",
        "RACHEL: Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks.",
        "ROSS: C'mon, what, you never think about our future?",
        "RACHEL: Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be.",
        "ROSS: No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good.",

        "ROSS: Yeah.",
        "RACHEL: But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that.",
        "ROSS: Ok fine.",
        "RACHEL: Thank you.",
        "ROSS: We're not done.",
        "RACHEL: I didn't know that.",
        "ROSS: Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that.",
        "RACHEL: Fine, I will.",

        "MONICA: Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?",
        "PHOEBE: I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, \"It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does.\"",
