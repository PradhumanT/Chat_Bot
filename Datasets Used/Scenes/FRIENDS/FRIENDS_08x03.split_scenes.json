        "(Joey looks at him, Phoebe tries not to smile, and Chandler is shocked.)",
        "Chandler: A Speedo? Uh, I don't have a Speedo. I'm gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit. (Goes into the bedroom.)",
        "Rachel: (entering) Oh good you're still here!",
        "Monica: Hey!",

        "Rachel: And I also wanted you guys to know that I am telling the father today. (They all look at her expectantly) What? What? What?",
        "(Pause.)",
        "Joey: We know its Ross!",
        "Rachel: How?! How do you know?",

        "Joey: Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.",
        "Ross: Why? What-what else could it be?",
        "Joey: Oh wow, I don't feel well.",
        "Ross: I'm telling you. I'm telling you. That's what it is. No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didn't say anything to you?",
        "Phoebe: (To Joey) Maybe it's something you ate?",
        "Joey: Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel.",
        "Ross: Yeah, I guess I should. (Starts to leave.) Man, y'know what I have to realize? Maybe I'm just not the type of guy women can have just one night with. Y'know, they-they always seem to want a little bit more. I should remember that. (He pauses and then exits.)",

        "(They hear a knocking sound coming from the hallway and go to investigate.)",
        "Joey: What the hell is that?",
        "(They go into the hallway and see Mr. Treeger watching one of New York's bravest breakdown Monica and Chandler's door with an ax.]",
        "Joey: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?",
        "Mr. Treeger: You said there was a gas leak in here.",
        "Phoebe: Well why don't you use your key?",
        "Mr. Treeger: Because by the time I find it on this thing (Holds up a huge key ring with a thousand keys on it), the whole place might have exploded. If that happens at another building that I manage, people are gonna start asking questions. (To the fireman) Come on! Hurry up.",
        "(With a final swing the door gives way.)",
        "Phoebe: Oh! We could have done that.",

        "Monica: Look at that! Look at that! They're going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?",
        "Chandler: No.",
        "Monica: Me neither! We have to get in! (She runs through the door with Chandler in tow.)",
        "Chandler: Just act like you belong.",

        "Chandler: Shh! (To the guy behind the counter) Nice to see you again. (They tries to walk past him.)",
        "Airline Employee: Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?",
        "Chandler: Yes, of course. (Shows him the tickets.)",
        "Airline Employee: I'm sorry, would you move your thumb? I can't see the seat number.",
        "Chandler: Oh that's all right, I have it memorized. It's 1A.",
        "Airline Employee: (grabbing the ticket from him) Sir, this is not a first class ticket. I'm sorry.",
        "Chandler: Apology accepted. Excuse us. (They try to enter again.)",
        "Airline Employee: Sir! I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.",

        "Ross: Okay. (He sits her down in a chair.) Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. That's been one heck of a see-saw hasn't it?",
        "Rachel: (confused) What?",
        "Ross: I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and...and certainly passionate, but don't you think it's better if we just stayed friends?",
        "Rachel: Seriously. What?!",
        "Ross: Okay. Okay. Y'know what? If you want to, we can do it one more time. I mean I'd-I'd be okay with that. In fact, I have some time right now.",
        "Rachel: Okay, y'know what? Can I, can I talk now?",
        "Ross: Oh sure. (He sits on the apothecary table and touches her hand.)",
        "Rachel: (touches his knee) I'm pregnant. (Ross stops.) Ross? (Ross is staring off into space.) Ross? (Ross is still frozen) Okay, whenever you're ready. (Sits back and opens her magazine.) And you're the father by the way-but you got that...",

        "Ross: Yeah, I need uh... I'm just-I don't know-I don't understand, umm, how this happened? We-we used a condom.",
        "Rachel: I know. I know, but y'know condoms only work like 97% of the time.",
        "Ross: What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!!",
        "Rachel: They do!",
        "Ross: No they don't!!! (He runs to the bedroom to check and returns with his box of condoms.) Well they should put it in huge black letters!!!!",
        "Rachel: Okay Ross come on let's just forget about the condoms.",
        "Ross: Oh well I may as well have!",
        "Rachel: Listen, y'know what? I was really freaked out too when I found out...",
        "Ross: Freaked out? Hey no, I'm not freaked out! I'm indignant! As a consumer!",
        "Rachel: Y'know what? Let's, let's talk later.",

        "Joey: (eating) Huh. So then I can heat this up? (Goes and does so.)",
        "Mr. Treeger: Anyway uh, I'll get moving on that new door.",
        "Phoebe: Oh great! And listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and Monica about this? 'Cause y'know umm, they don't-they don't have any kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them.",
        "Mr. Treeger: Well I'm gonna have to put on a new lock, they'll find out anyway.",
        "Phoebe: Oh no.",
        "Mr. Treeger: (measures the top of the doorframe) Whoa! This looks like an all day job, I'll have to cancel my yoga class. (Ross walks up.) Hey Ross!",

        "Phoebe: A little bit.",
        "Joey: How are you doing?",
        "Ross: Okay. Okay. I mean I'll be okay. It's just I don't think I handled it very well.",
        "Joey: Well, what did you say to her?",
        "Ross: Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful. And then when I turned around she was gone.",
        "Phoebe: Oh Ross.",
        "Ross: But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97% effective.",
        "Joey: (shocked) What?",
        "Ross: I gotta go find her.",
        "Joey: Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they don't even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box!",

        "Rachel: Okay. Head Ross! Head Ross! Head Ross!",
        "Ross: Right! Right! I just-I want you to know that I'm going to be there through this whole thing, okay? Okay? The doctor's appointments, the uh, the Lamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartment-Although we could probably worry about that 'til after we get married.",
        "Rachel: What married?",
        "Ross: Well yeah, I think we should get married.",
        "Rachel: What, because that's your answer to everything?",
        "Ross: No, because that's the right thing to do.",
        "Rachel: Yeah, maybe if you're in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are we?",
        "Ross: No but...but still you can't possibly do this alone.",

        "Ross: I'm just saying if you can't eat by yourself, how do you expect to have a baby by yourself?",
        "Rachel: I can too eat by myself!",
        "Ross: When have you ever?",
        "Rachel: When certain people leave the table and I am not finished!",
