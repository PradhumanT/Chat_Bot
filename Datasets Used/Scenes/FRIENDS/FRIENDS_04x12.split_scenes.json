    "Recap": [
        "Rachel and Monica demand that Chandler and Joey get rid of the birds when the rooster starts crowing every morning. Joey and Chandler argue with Monica and Rachel over who knows whom better, so Ross designs a trivia quiz with high stakes: if the men lose, they give up the chick and duck, but if the women lose, they switch apartments with the men. The result comes down to a tie breaker, which the girls lose, forcing them to move. Frank and Alice's embryos are implanted into Phoebe's uterus, leading to a tense wait that results in her pregnancy. In 2009, TV Guide ranked this episode #21 on its list of the 100 Greatest Episodes. [3]"

    "Transcript": [
        "[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, it's 0-Dark:30, in other words it's really, really early. Everyone's asleep, and all through the apartments not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. That is except for the chick, who turns out to be a rooster and is crowing in the sun. Needless to say, this awakens Monica and Rachel who rush into their living room, searching for the cause of the sound.]",
        "Rachel: What the hell is that?!! (to Monica) What the hell is that? Is that you? (Monica nods her head no, and Rachel realizes what is making that sound.) Ohhhhhhh! (storms over to Chandler and Joey's with Monica in trail.)",
        "Monica: Boy, you are really not a morning person.",
        "Rachel: (angrily) BACK OFF!!! (She starts banging on their door.) Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!",
        "(Chandler opens the door, finally.)",
        "Rachel: What is that noise?",
        "Chandler: You!",
        "Joey: It's the chick! She's...going through some changes.",

        "Dr. Zane: Um-hmm, five actually.",
        "Phoebe: Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?",
        "Dr. Zane: We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.",
        "Phoebe: That's it! 25 percent? That means that's it's like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!",
        "Frank: Hey, y'know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?",
        "Alice: Sweety, now, she's a woman, not a gumball machine.",
        "Phoebe: Okay, well y'know what, don't worry you guys, 'cause I'm-I'm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.",
        "Frank: Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.",
        "Alice: Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this. So, umm, we're kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.",

        "Monica: Hey, don't mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop.",
        "Alice: So umm, you feel like taking a test? There's only one question.",
        "Phoebe: All right, I will. No, I will. But umm, y'know just remember that it's still really early, okay so, if it says that I'm not pregnant, that doesn't mean that I'm not gonna get pregnant, okay and, and just please, just so I don't go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this.",
