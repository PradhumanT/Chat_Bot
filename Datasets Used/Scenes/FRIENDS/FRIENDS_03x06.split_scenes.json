        "When Janice playfully asks the gang if any of them (other than Ross and Rachel) have ever slept together, the friends flash back to the time when the coffee shop was a bar and their secrets are revealed: Ross and Phoebe nearly had sex on a pool table; Joey after first meeting Monica, came on to her by getting naked; before Chandler and Rachel knew each other, he tried coming on to her sexually when she and her girlfriends were having a drink at the bar. Rachel, engaged to Barry, brushed off Chandler, but later fantasized about having sex with him."
