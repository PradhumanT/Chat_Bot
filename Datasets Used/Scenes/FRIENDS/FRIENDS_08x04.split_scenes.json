    "Recap": [
        "Ross and Rachel argue over who initiated their sexual encounter that led to Rachel's pregnancy. Everyone is positive Ross was the instigator, but Ross claims it was Rachel. To prove it, he reveals how he accidentally videotaped their encounter; while he was videotaping himself practicing giving a speech, Rachel arrived. Everyone watches the tape that shows Rachel used Joey's contrived \"Backpacking in western Europe that leads to having sex\" story as a come-on to Ross. Monica and Chandler look forward to socializing with another newlywed couple they met on their honeymoon, only to discover the couple has blown them off with a fake phone number."

And there were tall trees all around. (Whispering) It was dead silent. Gorgeous. (Softly) And across the lake I saw...a beautiful woman...bathing herself...but she was crying...",

        "Rachel: Oh Ross!",
        "Ross: Hi!",
        "Rachel: Thank God you're here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?",
        "Ross: That's less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was.",
        "(They sit down on the couch, which is in front of the still recording camera.)",
        "Ross: (voiceover) So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot about the camera. [Cut back to the present day.] It kept rolling and recorded everything.",

        "Monica: Yeah, definitely.",
        "Ross: What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!",
        "Joey: Y'know what? This is not fair to her. Let's just forget the tape!",
        "Ross: Thank you. (Joey mouths to Ross, \"You'll show me right?\") No!",
        "Joey: You're right. (Mouths, \"I know you'll show me, right?)",

        "[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe are now sitting in the living room.]",
        "Monica: I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.",
        "Joey: Y'know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn't give you real names either.",
        "Monica: Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don't give out fake names.",
        "Joey: Oh yeah? (To Phoebe) Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.",
        "Phoebe: Regina Philange. (Ken and Regina shake hands.)",
        "Chandler: I still don't get it, we didn't do anything wrong.",
        "Monica: I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes.",
        "Chandler: I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!",
        "Monica: (rolling her head from side to side) Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah! (Joey and Phoebe laugh.)",
        "Chandler: Well maybe it was all of your questions.",
        "Monica: What about my questions?",
        "Chandler: The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!",
        "Monica: Oh, I'm sorry. Was that another joke?",
        "Chandler: (angrily) Was that another question?",
        "Rachel: (entering) Hey! Is Ross still here?",
        "Joey: Uh no Rach, he's gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake.",
        "Rachel: Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had s*x with you and I taped it? (Joey smiles luridly) Oh forget it! (Ross enters.) Oh there he is now, the father of my child, the p0rn king of the west village.",
        "Ross: Look, it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, I didn't even watch it! Anyway, here. (He takes the tape out of his coat pocket.) I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself. (Tosses her the tape.)",
        "Rachel: Thank you. (She sets it on the floor and is about to stomp on it with her shoe when the rest of the gang jumps up and yells simultaneously.) What? (They all yell again.) You don't want to see this do you?",
        "Monica: Hell yeah!!!",
        "Rachel: I am not gonna show you this!",
        "Phoebe: No! Not the s*x part, just the stuff leading up to it.",
        "Ross: Forget it, she's destroying it.",
        "Phoebe: Okay fine! Fine! We'll just have to think of some other way to put the whole 'Who came onto who,' thing to rest! Come on now, think!!",
        "Ross: Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? It's Rachel's tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story.",
        "Rachel: I wanna see it.",
        "Ross: What?!",
        "Rachel: Clearly you don't want people to see this tape. Now I don't want people to see this tape either, but you so badly don't people to see it makes me want to see it. You see?",
        "Joey: (confused) Are we watchin' the tape or not?!",
        "Ross: I don't want people to see it for your sake.",
        "Rachel: Ahh, I don't believe you. I think you don't want them to see you begging me. (Goes to put the tape in the VCR)",
        "Ross: Rachel, please...",
        "Rachel: Ah, a little preview!",
        "Ross: Fine. Fine, but I want the record to show that I tried to take the high road, because in about five minutes I'm gonna be saying...(He laughs and points at Rachel sarcastically.)",
        "(They both sit down.)",
        "Rachel: Okay, here we go. (Pushes play.)",

        "Phoebe: You're gonna get pregnant.",
        "Rachel: (on tape) I screwed up so bad, I told Monica that I would stuff and send all these wedding invitations like weeks ago and I-I...",
        "Ross: (on tape) You didn't do it?",
        "Rachel: (on tape) I-I know-I had put them in...in-in my desk at work and I completely forgot about them until today.",
        "(Chandler is shocked and Rachel gets scared of Monica very quickly.)",
        "Monica: (taking Rachel's hand) Sweetie okay. It's okay. Everybody made it to the wedding. I'm fine.",
        "Rachel: Kinda hurtin' my hand though.",
        "Monica: I know.",
        "Rachel: (on tape) (Ross hands her a glass of wine) I cannot believe that I did this. Especially after Monica just went on and on and on about it! (Mimicking Monica) \"Okay Rachel! Here are the invitations Rachel! Now be very careful Rachel! Please, drinking no liquids around the invitations Rachel!\" (She tilts her wine glass above and moves it back and forth across the invitations) Whoa oh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh...oh-oh-oh...",
        "(Rachel hits fast forward. Monica is completely shocked.)",
        "Chandler: Did you do it on our invitations?!",
        "Ross: (pause) Not on the ones we sent out.",
        "Chandler: So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed! (Slams the framed invitation down onto the table.)",
        "(Rachel stops fast forwarding.)",
        "Rachel: (on tape) Can you believe this is already happening? I mean it seems like yesterday they just got engaged.",
        "Ross: (on tape) I know. Hey remember...remember the night they got engaged? How uh, you and I almost...",
        "Rachel: (on tape) Oh, I remember how we almost. Do you think we would've gone through with it? Y'know, if we hadn't gotten caught. Do you think we would've done it?",
        "Ross: (on tape) I mean I...I know I wanted to. I just, I just wasn't sure if you wanted to.",
        "Rachel: (on tape) Oh I wanted to.",
        "(Ross and Rachel trade looks while watching the tape.)",
        "Ross: (on tape) So we...we both wanted to.",

        "Rachel: So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?",
        "Ross: Yeah. Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesn't matter. I mean, I think it would've happened either way. I mean if you hadn't initiated it I-I-I know I would've.",
