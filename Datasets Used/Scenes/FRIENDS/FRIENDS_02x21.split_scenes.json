    "Recap": [
        "Chandler and Ross clash with two bullies at the coffee shop, one of whom steals Chandler's hat. Monica, down to her last few dollars, plays the stock market based solely on the ticker symbols to avoid taking a job at a tacky 1950s themed diner. Phoebe makes multiple attempts to visit her birth father, but instead meets her half-brother, Frank Buffay Jr.; she learns that her father left his second family four years earlier. Monica loses her savings due to her unwise investments, and is forced to take the job at the Moondance Diner , wearing a silly uniform and dancing on the counter to old songs."

        "[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Everyone is there. Monica is watching stock prices on a business channel.]",
        "JOEY: Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?",
        "MONICA: 'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.",
        "RACHEL: Ok honey, you really need a job.",
        "ROSS: Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.",
        "MONICA: Really.",
        "PHOEBE: Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there.",
        "ROSS: On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh.",
        "PHOEBE: No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet...which is my father's last name.",
        "EVERYONE: Ahh.",
        "PHOEBE: And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.",
        "MONICA: His indian name?",
        "PHOEBE: No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so.",
        "ROSS: Freakish.",
        "MONICA: Wow.",
        "JOEY: Freaky.",
        "MONICA: Weird, weird.",
        "RACHEL: Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?",
        "PHOEBE: Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him.",
        "MONICA: Why?",
        "PHOEBE: Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist.",

        "ROSS: Yeah alright.",
        "[they sit at the couch]",
        "BIG BULLY: [walks back from the counter] Hey you're in our seats.",
        "ROSS: Oh, sorry we didn't know.",
        "LITTLE BULLY: [walks back from the counter] Hey, we were sitting there.",
        "CHANDLER: Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?",
        "LITTLE BULLY: Is that supposed to be funny?",
        "CHANDLER: No actually, I was just going for colorful.",
        "BIG BULLY: What's with this guy?",
        "LITTLE BULLY: What's with you?",
        "ROSS: Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee.",
        "[as they're walking off, little bully grabs Chandlers hat from behind and puts it on himself]",
        "CHANDLER: What just happened?",
        "LITTLE BULLY: I just took your hat. See, I can be funny too. My, my joke is that I, I took your hat.",
        "CHANDLER: That, that is funny. Can I have it back?",
        "LITTLE BULLY: No.",
        "CHANDLER: No?",
        "BIG BULLY: No.",
        "ROSS: Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come on guy just, just give him back the hat.",
        "BIG BULLY: Why should we?",
        "ROSS: Because it's a special hat. [Chandler looks at Ross funny] See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler...",
        "CHANDLER: Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?",
        "BIG BULLY: You got a problem with that?",
        "CHANDLER: No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page.",
        "[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Joey and Rachel are sitting there and Monica walks in.]",
        "RACHEL: Hey, how'd the interview go?",
        "MONICA: It bit. It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter. I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes. I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries?",
        "RACHEL: So don't do it.",
        "MONICA: How can I not do it? I have $127 in the bank.",
        "JOEY: Monica, relax, go get a beer.",

        "ROSS: Hi.",
        "RACHEL: Hi. [Ross turns to Rachel and they hug]",
        "CHANDLER: Ohhh [turns as if to hug someone] Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one.",
        "JOEY: Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back.",
        "CHANDLER: Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.",
        "MONICA: [seeing TV] Hey, I went up.",
        "RACHEL: What?",
        "MONICA: My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had invested my $127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have...a lot more than that today. Ya know what, I'm gonna do it.",
        "JOEY: Do what?",
        "MONICA: Put all my money in me.",

        "CHANDLER: Hey.",
        "ROSS: What?",
        "CHANDLER: Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets?",
        "ROSS: Do you say this stuff to girls?",
        "BIG BULLY: Hehehehey, isn't that the guy who used to wear your hat?",
        "LITTLE BULLY: And look where they're sitting.",
        "ROSS: You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door.",
        "BIG BULLY: Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.",
        "LITTLE BULLY: Yeah.",
        "BIG BULLY: This couch belongs to us.",

        "BIG BULLY: You know what I keep wondering? Why you two are still sitting here.",
        "ROSS: Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther, these guys are trying to take our seat.",
        "GUNTHER: Fellas, these guys were here first.",
        "BIG BULLY: Oh, sorry, I didn't realize.",
        "LITTLE BULLY: Sorry.",
        "GUNTHER: There you go.",
        "ROSS: Thank you Gunther. We didn't want to have to go and do that.",
        "LITTLE BULLY: He told on us?",
        "BIG BULLY: You told on us?",
        "ROSS: Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice. [flicks the ends of the big bully's tie]",

        "ROSS: I know.",
        "BIG BULLY: Alright, let's take this outside.",
        "ROSS: Let's, let's take this outside? Who talks like that?",

        "LITTLE BULLY: Well then here's the deal, you won't have to so long as never ever show your faces in this coffee house ever again.",
        "CHANDLER: I think you played the Gunther card too soon.",
        "[Scene: Back in the cab in front of Phoebe's dad's house.]",
        "JOEY: Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.",
        "PHOEBE: Yeah, I don't know.",
        "RACHEL: What's the matter?",
        "PHOEBE: I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.",
        "RACHEL: Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand.",
        "JOEY: Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?",
        "PHOEBE: Ok, thanks. Sorry, again",
        "[She starts the cab and pulls forward. We hear a squish and a dog yelp.]",
        "PHOEBE: [innocently] What was that?",
        "JOEY: Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.",
        "[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Joey is eating breakfast, Rachel has just gotten up, and Monica is on the phone.]",
        "MONICA: I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.",
        "RACHEL: Time is money my friend?",
        "JOEY: Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.'",
        "MONICA: Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?",
        "JOEY: Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.",
        "RACHEL: How did you make $17.",
        "MONICA: Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.",
        "JOEY: How come those?",
        "MONICA: Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.",
        "RACHEL: What happened to uh, MEG.?",
        "MONICA: MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.",
        "JOEY: That is so not my motto.",
        "PHOEBE: [enters] Hey.",
        "RACHEL: Hey Phoebs. Oh hey, how's the dog?",
        "PHOEBE: Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, he said that the little fella's gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow.",
        "JOEY: Good.",
        "RACHEL: Oh, thank God.",
        "PHOEBE: Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.",
        "RACHEL: Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?",
        "PHOEBE: I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone. What am I gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.'",
        "JOEY: Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it.",
        "PHOEBE: Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok. [goes over and grabs the phone that's sitting by Monica]",
        "MONICA: DON'T...be too long with the phone.",
        "RACHEL: She'll be a much better friend when the market closes.",
        "JOEY: [dials the phone] It's a woman.",
        "PHOEBE: So talk to her.",
        "JOEY: [in a fake voice] Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye. [hangs up]",
        "RACHEL: Why the voice.",
        "JOEY: [in the voice] Hard to say.",
        "[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Ross is sitting at the bar, Chandler serves up two mugs of hot water.]",
        "CHANDLER: Your cappucino sir.",
        "ROSS: Thank you.",

        "CHANDLER: Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.",
        "ROSS: Absolutely.",
        "[they both stir thier coffee and proceed to stare into the mugs]",
        "ROSS: How come it's not mixing with the water?",
        "CHANDLER:Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.",
        "[they both try to drink while continuously stirring]",
        "JOEY: [walks out of his room] Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.",
        "CHANDLER: Ok.",
        "ROSS: No.",
        "CHANDLER: No?",
        "ROSS: No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.",
        "CHANDLER: Alright, hang on a second there Custer.",
        "JOEY: Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?",
        "ROSS: Yeah, sure.",
        "JOEY: By someone besides Monica?",
        "ROSS: No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'.",
        "CHANDLER: Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back.",
        "[Scene: Outside Monica and Rachel's apartment. Rachel is returning.]",

        "RACHEL: For what?",
        "MONICA: I've gotta get back in the game.",
        "RACHEL: Why, when did you get out of the game?",
        "MONICA: I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it.",

        "PHOEBE: It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on purpose. She's a vegetarian.",
        "MRS BUFFAY: What are these, stitches?",
        "PHOEBE: Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast.",

        "FRANK: Except stilts.",
        "PHOEBE: Stilts?",
        "FRANK: Yeah, he loved stilts. One time I was upstairs, I was stealing cigarettes out of my mom's purse, and uh, all of a sudden I look over and there's my dad's head bobbing past the window. He just had this big smile on his face and he was waving 'cause he was always happiest when he was on his stilts.",
