        "Ross: [pause]...Yeah.",
        "Chandler: Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.",
        "Ross: Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt... [claps hands three times]",

        "Joey: What?",
        "Phoebe: Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.",
        "Chandler: That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.",
        "Ross: Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...",
