        "Monica gets back together with Fun Bobby, who the other friends realize has a drinking problem. Monica persuades him to quit drinking, only to discover he is no longer fun. Joey lands the role of Dr. Drake Ramoray, a neurosurgeon on Days of Our Lives after refusing to sleep with the casting lady, who admired his integrity. Rachel dates Russ, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Ross (both roles played by David Schwimmer ). After finally realizing Russ is Ross's double, Rachel dumps him. At the end, Russ and Julie ( Lauren Tom ) meet and fall in love at first sight."

        "RACH: Joey, would you slow down? They're not gonna be sold out of papers at one o'clock in the morning.",
        "JOEY: I'm excited! I've never gotten reviewed before.",
        "MNCA: You were so amazing as the king. I was really impressed, I was.",
        "PHOE: Although, you know what? You might want to consider wearing underwear next time. Yeah, cause when you sat down on your throne you could kind of see your... royal subject.",
        "JOEY: Here it is, here it is. [reading from newspaper] The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingly unskilled portrayal of the king.",
        "CHAN: OK, look, that is one guy's opinion, alright. Phoebs, read yours.",
        "PHOE: OK. [reading] The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction...",
        "CHAN: Does anyone have one from a different paper? Ross, read yours.",
        "ROSS: I don't want to.",
        "RACH: Joey, honey, they don't know what they're talking about.",
        "ROSS: Yeah.",
        "JOEY: Maybe they do. I've been doin' this ten years and I haven't gotten anywhere. There's gotta be a reason.",
        "ROSS: Oh c'mon. Maybe you're just, uhhh... paying your dues.",
        "JOEY: No, no, no, it.. it's too hard. It's not worth it. I quit.",
        "MNCA: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait one minute. Wait a minute. I believe this will change your mind. [Reads from paper] In a mediocre play, Joseph Tribbiana was able to achieve brilliant new levels of... continued on page 153...[turns it] sucking.",

        "ROSS: [sullenly] Hiiiiii.",
        "PHOE: Are... are you OK?",
        "ROSS: Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he, what. He, he's here, isn't he?",
        "MNCA: Maybe.",

        "FBOB: No, I'm picking you up.",
        "JOEY: Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me... [Fun Bobby picks Joey up off the ground, bounces him. Joey laughs.] Alright! It still works.",
        "FBOB: OK, now before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up? [everyone raises their hands] I'm still gonna go.",

        "PHOE: Fun Bobby is so great.",
        "MNCA: Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.",
        "PHOE: Half full of looooovvvvve.",
        "MNCA: And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.",

        "ROSS: Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.",
        "PHOE: Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was soooo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'",
        "JOEY: Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?",
        "MNCA: Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.",

        "PHOE: Um, cake.",
        "RACH: Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake. [Phoebe and Rachel go to counter.]",
        "MNCA: You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.",
        "FBOB: Well, I would make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.",
        "MNCA: Bobby.",
        "FBOB: Yeah, OK.",
        "MNCA: Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you.",
        "FBOB: OK, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this, but, I don't know... I always made excuses about it, like... uhhh... 'I'm just a social drinker,' or, 'C'mon, it's Flag Day.'",
        "MNCA: So, what are you saying now?",
        "FBOB: I guess I'm saying, I'll try and quit. I kinda like that you worry about me. [they hug]",
        "PHOE: [comes back to couch, with cake] Sooo, what's goin' on, huh?",

        "JOEY: Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!",
        "PHOE: Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.",
        "CHAN: Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.",
        "PHOE: Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.",
        "RACH: Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans.",

        "MNCA: What are you talking about?",
        "RACH: I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.",
        "PHOE: But you guys came so close.",
        "RACH: Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gonna have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross.",
        "[Russ enters Central Perk. He looks like Ross, except for his chin and hair (it is David Schwimmer in a dual role).]",

        "ESTL: Oh, isn't Lori a doll?",
        "JOEY: Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.",
        "ESTL: Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out. [picks up the phone] Yeah, hi, Lori please. [pause] Hi darling. So how 'bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, isn't he terrific? [pause] Uh-huuuuh. [pause] Uh-huuuuh. OK, doll. Talk to you later.

        "MNCA: Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?",
        "PHOE: OK, OK, don't get all squinky.",
        "RACH: Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.",
        "MNCA: But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.",
        "PHOE: Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free.",
        "[Russ enters, walking in behind Chandler.]",

        "CHAN: Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have s*x. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.",
        "JOEY: I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.",
