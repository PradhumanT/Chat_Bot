    "Recap": [
        "Rachel and Phoebe see Chandler getting into a car with another woman. He dodges their questions by pretending to be at work but they follow him to the suburbs and find them entering a house. They believe he is cheating on Monica and tell Ross and Joey. The four of them tell Monica but Monica doesn't react the way they thought she would. It soon comes out they are looking to buy a house in the suburbs to raise their family (the woman having been their realtor). The group tries to convince them to stay in the city while reminiscing about the past few years. In the end Monica and Chandler get the house and tell everyone they are moving right after giving them gifts."

        "Monica: (really excited) Mmh... this cake is amazing!",
        "Rachel: My God, get a room!",
        "Monica: I would get a room with this cake. I think I could show this cake a good time!",
        "Phoebe: If you had to, what would you give up, food or s*x?",
        "Monica: (with no hesitation) s*x!",
        "Chandler: (looking at her) Seriously, answer faster!",
        "Monica: Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said \"s*x\" I wasn't thinking about \"s*x with you\"!",
        "Chandler: (to Phoebe) It's like a giant hug.",
        "Phoebe: Ross, how about you. What would you give up, s*x or food?",
        "Ross: Food.",
        "Phoebe: Ok, how about... uhm... s*x or dinosaurs?",
        "Ross: Oh my God. It's like Sophie's Choice.",
        "Rachel: Oh God. What about you, Joe? What would you give up, s*x or food?",
        "Joey: Uhm... oh... I don't know, it's too hard.",

        "Joey: Oh... food. No, s*x. Food! s*x! Food! Se-I don't know! Good God, I don't know, I want girls on bread!",

        "Phoebe: You know, I'm always right about these things.",
        "Rachel: No, you're not! Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you!",
        "Phoebe: Well, I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it! (looking outside) See, there's something going on with them. Look, he's getting into the car with her!",
        "Rachel: Oh, that doesn't mean anything.",
        "Phoebe: Oh yeah? Well, let's see. (she takes her mobile phone) Ok, duck down. (they both get down to hide themselves. Phoebe calls Chandler)",

        "Chandler: Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day.",
        "Phoebe: (shocked) Oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either \"Liar, Liar\" or \"Betrayal\", or... \"An Affair To Remember\".",
        "Chandler: Those are all really old!",
        "Phoebe: Ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm...",

        "Chandler: Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!",
        "Monica: So? What do you think of the house?",
        "Chandler: It's perfect. It's everything we've been looking for.",
        "Monica: Isn't it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?",
        "Chandler: And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps? (pause) What were the things you said?",
        "Monica: Don't you love the huge yard?",
        "Chandler: And the fireplace in the bedroom.",
        "Monica: And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!",
        "Chandler: This is bringing out a lovely color in you!",
        "Monica: So? Do you think we should get it?",
        "Chandler: I don't know. What do you think?",

        "Chandler: I don't know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy's car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day.",
        "Monica: Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?",
        "Chandler: We don't. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing.",
        "Monica: Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.",
        "Chandler: I know. Gooooood luck with it.",
        "[Scene: Joey's apartment. Everybody except Monica and Chandler is there.]",

        "Joey: Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just can't believe he would do this to Monica!",
        "Ross: I know, and with the baby coming?",
        "Phoebe: So, should we tell her?",
        "Ross: I don't know. Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?",
        "Phoebe: Why? Who'd you seen him with?",
        "Ross: No one, I'm just saying if... (Phoebe starts pinching him in his neck)",
        "Phoebe: TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!",
        "Ross: (yelling in pain) I know nothing! Mike's a great guy, it was hypothetical!",
        "Phoebe: All right. (she releases him). He is a good guy. You're right, he wouldn't cheat.",
        "Ross: Believe me, if I did see with someone, there's no way I... (Phoebe starts pinching him again)",
        "Phoebe : WHO DID YOU SEE HIM WITH?",
        "[Scene: Monica's apartment. Monica is cleaning with a vacuum and then she cleans it with a dust buster. The guys enter the room.]",
        "Rachel: Oh, look at her, so happy!",
        "Monica: If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!",
        "Joey: Hey, is uhm... is Chandler here?",
        "Monica: No, he's picking up dinner, why, what's up?",

        "Phoebe: They went in together. So sorry.",
        "Monica: Oh my God! Oh my God that's awful! What did you think of the house?",
        "(they all look confused and sorry for her)",
        "Phoebe: What?",
        "Joey: (walking towards her to hold her and support her) Monica, you understand what we are saying, right?",
        "Monica: Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously... (to the rest) Did you think the neighborhood was homey? (Chandler enters)",
        "Chandler: Hey!",
        "Joey: (to Chandler) You son of a bitch!",
        "Chandler: Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?",
        "Monica: (goes to Chandler) Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.",
        "Rachel: Who's Nancy?",
        "Ross: What's going on?",
        "Monica: (turns to them) Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big.",
        "Chandler: Yeah (motions them to sit and they do) I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.",
        "Joey: I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!!",
        "Phoebe: Why do you have a realtor?",
        "Monica: Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.",
        "Joey: (clearly shocked) What?",
        "Rachel: Are you serious?",
        "Monica: When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.",
        "Phoebe: So you're gonna move?",
        "Ross: Oh my God.",
        "Joey: Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!",
        "Rachel: What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!",
        "Monica: And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...",
        "Chandler: ...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.",
        "Ross: (sarcastic) So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?",
        "Phoebe: Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?",
        "Ross: You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay.",
        "Joey: No, no, it's not, don't listen to him! (to Ross) I'm gonna thump you! (points his fist at him)",
        "Ross: (to Joey) It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay (back to Mon and Chan), but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.",
        "(pause before Monica and Chandler speak, they look like they are looking for the right words)",
        "Chandler: Actually, we already found a house we love.",
        "Ross: What?",
        "Monica: And about an hour ago, we made an offer.",
        "(All the friends looked shocked and confused. There is a long silence.)",

        "TIME LAPSE",
        "Ross: You put an offer on a house?",
        "Monica: (smiling) It's so sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees... (gets cut off)",
        "Phoebe: Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers?",
        "Chandler: I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.",
        "Joey: Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food? (Walks towards the fridge) Because I can stop doing that, (looks at the fridge) I really, really think I can!",
        "Chandler: (goes towards Joey) You know that's not the reason Joe. (Joey hugs him and after, he takes something from the fridge and puts it in his mouth. He goes back to where he was standing before)",
        "Monica: We think if you saw it, you'd understand. I mean you guys were there. (Points to Rachel and Phoebe) It is beautiful, isn't it?",
        "Rachel: Yeah it is.",
        "Joey: What the hell are you doin'?",
        "Rachel: Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was: I can't believe Chandler is screwing this woman, but MAN this would be a nice place to live!",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, but so is this.",
        "Ross: Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?",

And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!",

I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?
