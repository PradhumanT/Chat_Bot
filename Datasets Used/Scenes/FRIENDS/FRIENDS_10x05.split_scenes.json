    "Episode Title": "The One Where Rachel's Sister Baby-sits",
    "Recap": [
        "Rachel's sister Amy (Christina Applegate) shows up at Ross' looking for Rachel and Rachel quickly learns she plans to marry her ex-boyfriend's father. Rachel takes her in, much to Joey's chagrin, and tries to help her get her life together. Amy offers to baby-sit Emma, who she calls Ella, but messes up by getting Emma's ears pierced. Rachel is incredibly upset but eventually her and Amy come to an understanding when Rachel finds out her other sister, Jill, is now fat. Mike attempts to propose to Phoebe on the big screen but Phoebe tells him how lame that is when another couple gets engaged that way. Phoebe tries to fix it by proposing to him on the big screen but Mike gets laughed at. Mike finally proposes at a restaurant and Phoebe accepts. Monica and Chandler ask Rachel to write a letter of recommendation for them to their adoption agency but Joey feels left out. They ask Joey but he tries to write the letter using big words, only for Joey to use a thesaurus to a ridiculous degree (to the point that he refers to himself as a baby kangaroo). He finally re-drafts the letter but gives the handwritten letter to the agency before Monica and Chandler can approve it. The agency thinks a child has written the letter and love it. Note: Originally aired as a 43-minute episode."

        "Rachel: I've never given her a cookie. Have you?",
        "Joey: No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from a can!",

        "Phoebe: Uh-uh. Ehm, a Knicks game.",
        "Joey: Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed?",
        "Phoebe: Hey, you know what, I've never had a one-year anniversary before, so no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy pants, and... I'm gonna put on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have s*x in a public rest room.",

        "Amy: Well, I have huge news.",
        "Rachel: (Emma starts crying in the other room) Oh sorry, hold on. Let me just check on the baby!",
        "Amy: Wait, this is important! Can Ella wait? (Rachel goes to Emma)",

        "Ross: Why don't you use your Thesaurus?",
        "Joey: What did I just say?",
        "Ross: Watch. (he takes the laptop) Here, you ehm... You highlight the word you want to change. Go under Tools and the Thesaurus generates... 'gives'... 'gives' a whole list of choices. You can pick the word that sounds smartest.",
        "Joey: Oh my God, that's great! I'm smart!! No, no, I'm... (he uses the Thesaurus) \"brainy, bright, clever\", I love this thing! Look out ladies, Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package!!",

        "Amy: It's his dad.",
        "Rachel: Huh... wow, so he's gotta be...",
        "Amy: Old? Yeah! But he travels a lot, so he's hardly ever there.",
        "Rachel: Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like...",
        "Amy: Myron. Hmm... I told you he was old!",
        "Rachel: Oh... sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married somebody that I didn't love. Do you remember Barry?",
        "Amy: Humpf, remember him? How we used to make out all the time after you went to sleep.",
        "Rachel: Sometimes just nodding is ok. (pause) Uhm, so but anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever made. Honey, you deserve true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere. Someone that is your age, that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!",
        "Amy: (thinks about it) You're right, you're right! I'm gonna do it!",

        "Mike: I know. This has been the best year... (the crowd starts cheering so he starts yelling) THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST YEAR OF MY LIFE!",
        "Phoebe: ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH!",
        "Mike: I FEEL THE SAME WAY!",
        "Phoebe: YOU'RE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND (crowd stops cheering) YOU'RE AMAZING IN BED (everyone hears it and stare at them.) (to everybody) IT'S OUR ANNIVERSARY!",
        "Announcer: Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the big screen on the score board. Someone has a special question to ask. (on the screen there's written 'Julie, will you marry me?' and goes on to show a guy kneeling down in front of a girl holding out a ring to her)",
        "Phoebe: Oh how lame... oh, it's so tacky, and impersonal.",
        "Mike: Really?",
        "Phoebe: Oh, it's the worst way to propose!",
        "Mike: (looks strangely shocked) Excuse me... (he leaves, then Phoebe realizes what she did).",
        "[Scene: Monica's apartment. Joey enters the room]",
        "Joey: Hey, finished my recommendation. (he hands it over to Chandler) Here. And I think you'll be very, very happy. It's the longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at p0rn.",
        "Chandler: (reading) I don't... uh... understand.",
        "Joey: (sounding very proud of himself) Some of the words are a little too sophisticated for ya?",
        "Monica: (also reading it) It doesn't make any sense.",
        "Joey: Of course it does! It's smart! I used the the-saurus!",
        "Chandler: On every word?",
        "Joey: Yep!",
        "Monica: Alright, what was this sentence originally? (shows the sentence to Joey)",
        "Joey: Oh, 'They are warm, nice, people with big hearts'.",
        "Chandler: And that became 'they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?",
        "Joey: Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude.",
        "Monica: Hey Joey, I don't think we can use this.",
        "Joey: Why not?",
        "Monica: Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani (Joey makes a 'and-what's-wrong-with-that' look). Hey, why don't you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself!",
        "Chandler: You know what? You don't need a thesaurus, just write from here, (points at his own heart) your full sized aortic pump.",

        "Amy: Well, I'm staying with you guys!",
        "Joey: What?",
        "Amy: We're gonna be roomies! (she snaps her finger and points at Joey, snaps her fingers again and points to the bags) Come on!",
        "[Scene: Joey's apartment. Rachel is in the living room and Joey comes out of his room.]",
        "Joey: You slept out here?",
        "Rachel: Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling 'Myron, get off!'",
        "Joey: But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me we're getting rid of her.",
        "Rachel: Joey, I can't do that!",
        "Joey: Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said (aping Amy badly) \"Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!\" I don't need that kind of talk in my house!",
        "Rachel: Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she's difficult, but I think it's really good that she's here.",
        "Joey: 'Cause we will appreciate it more when she's gone?",
        "Rachel: No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of me.",
        "Joey: Yeah, Monica made us!",
        "Rachel: Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don't think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn't for you guys. See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it's gonna take patience, but that's ok.",
        "Amy: Good morning.",
        "Joey: Yeaah.",
        "Rachel: Amy, that's what I was supposed to wear today, that's why I hung it on the door.",
        "Amy: Oh, sweety, you can't pull this off.",
        "Rachel: Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.",
        "Amy: Oh, I can't, honey. I'm gonna go get my eyebrows shaped. (points at her eyebrows) I am not happy. (to Joey who has a pizza box in his hands) Oh... sure you wanna eat that?",
        "Joey: (yelling at her) I'M CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!",

        "Phoebe: Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.",
        "Chandler: I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.",
        "Monica: Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song.",
        "Ross: Seriously?",
        "Chandler: Word!",
        "Phoebe: Well, mine was worse than that.",
        "Rachel: Well, what happened?",
        "Phoebe: We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing...",
        "Rachel: Oh, that is so tacky.",
        "Phoebe: Well, that's what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!",
        "Monica: Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?",
        "Rachel: Phoebe, that's huge!",
        "Ross: Well, do you wanna marry him?",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I don't think he's ever gonna ask again! I mean, I said no in Barbados and now this!",
        "Chandler: She's right! If I were a guy and... (stops himself mid-sentence...everyone stares at him) Did I just say if I were a guy..?",
        "Monica: Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to him!",
        "Phoebe: Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?",
        "Monica: I proposed to Chandler! (Phoebe stops herself from laughing) Alright, moving on...",
        "Chandler: Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!",
        "Monica: Thank you.",
        "Phoebe: (To Rachel and Ross) Well, do you think I should propose?",
        "Rachel: I think it could be kind of great!",

        "Phoebe: Ok, ok, so how should I do it?",
        "Monica: How about at a game, on the big screen?",
        "Rachel: (Sarcastically) Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker? (claps her hands together, faking excitement)",
        "Monica: What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to, plus he'd never suspect it!",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two (points to Ross and Chandler) like that?",
        "Chandler: Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?",
        "(Amy walks in carrying a phone handset)",
        "Amy: (To Rachel) Nana is on the phone (Hands the phone over to Rachel)",
        "Rachel: (Takes the phone) Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years ago!!",
        "Amy: She did? Who got her condo in Boca?",
        "Rachel: (Into the phone) Hello? (announces to Amy) Oh, it's our nanny! (goes back to the phone conversation) Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye! (Hangs up) (To Ross) That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today?",
        "Ross: No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat's been hurting?",
        "Rachel: Menstrual cramps.",
        "Ross: I don't think that's what this is.",
        "Rachel: (To Monica, Chandler and Phoebe) Can any of you watch Emma?",

        "Rachel: Yeah.",
        "Ross: Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child.",
        "Rachel: Why not?",
        "Ross: Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella!",
        "Rachel: (Defends Amy) Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name!",
        "Ross: Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.",

        "Ross: I... I don't know..",
        "Rachel: Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows (points at her own to emphasize the word) shaped to do this alright? Do you understand how important that is in our world?",
        "(Amy approaches from behind)",
        "Amy: um... listen, I couldn't help but overhear... 'cause I was trying to... Listen, let me do this alright? I really wanna help you guys out, and plus Rachel's been so wonderful to me... (looks at hem pleadingly)",
        "(Rachel looks at Ross and her agrees silently)",
        "Rachel: Absolutely.",

        "Joey: Yeah.",
        "Chandler: Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?",
        "Joey: No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to hand-write it. (Chandler and Monica look even more shocked)",
        "Monica: You hand-wrote it?",
        "Joey: Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at all! See ya later! (Leaves)",
        "Monica: Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!",
        "Chandler: It's ok, it's ok. You know what? (Takes out his mobile) I'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. (starts dialing)",
