    "Recap": [
        "After having sex with Ross, Rachel says it was 'the perfect way to say goodbye', and he realizes he is still in love with her. Phoebe and Joey pack Monica and Chandler's belongings as the couple accompany Erica to the hospital. Ross and Phoebe race to the airport to tell Rachel of his feelings - but she gets on the plane anyway. Meanwhile, Erica gives birth to twins which Chandler and Monica name Jack and Erica. Still on the plane, contemplating Ross' plea, Rachel has a change of heart. She leaves the plane and goes to Ross' apartment to tell him that she loves him. After years of separation, the two finally get back together for good, saying \"this is it\", hinting they will marry after the series (which is revealed to be true in the spin-off, Joey ). Back in Monica's apartment, the friends turn in their keys and go out for their last cup of coffee together as a group. The series ends with the friends leaving and a camera panning the apartment and the city."

        "Chandler: Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.",
        "Monica: She doesn't have a stomach-ache. She's in labor!",

        "[Cut to Ross's apartment. Ross and Rachel are there. It's another scene from 1016 TOW Rachel's Going Away Party.]",
        "Rachel: So if you think I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me.",
        "Ross: Rach!",
        "Rachel: What?!",

        "Monica: No, last time you said it like Dracula, and it scared her! Can I get you anything? You want some more ice chips?",
        "Erica: No, I'm okay.",
        "Monica: Alright, I'll be right back.",
        "Chandler: Where are you going?",
        "Monica: To use the bathroom.",
        "Chandler: You can't leave me alone with her.",
        "Monica: What?",
        "Chandler: This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!",
        "Monica: What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?",
        "Chandler: It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together.",
        "Monica: You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.",

        "Chandler: So, ah... Any plans for the summer?",
        "Erica: I don't know. Maybe church-camp?",
        "Chandler: Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?",
        "Erica: What?",
        "Chandler: Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.",
        "(Erica just looks at him like he's crazy.)",
        "Chandler: One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this.",

        "Joey: Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.",
        "Phoebe: I did not see that coming.",
        "Joey: Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house, you know? It has that big backyard. And then, when they get old, they can go to that special farm that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.",
        "Phoebe: Yes.",
        "Joey: Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there.",

        "Ross: Uh, we, y'know, we worked things out.",
        "Phoebe: What's that smile? Did something happen with you two?",
        "Ross: Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell, but I'm also not one to have s*x and shut up. We totally did it!",
        "Joey: Oh my God. You and Rachel?",
        "Ross: I know, it's pretty great.",
        "Joey: So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together?",
        "Ross: Oh, I.. I don't know. We didn't really get to talk.",
        "Phoebe: But do you wanna get back together?",
        "Ross: I don't know. It was incredible. I mean, it just felt so right. When I was holding her, I mean, I never wanted to let her go. You know what? Yeah, I do. I wanna be together.",
        "Phoebe: (screaming) YAY!",
        "Ross: Shhh!",
        "Phoebe: (quietly) Yay!",
        "Joey: So, so is she still going to Paris?",

        "Chandler: Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.",
        "Doctor: Start pushing. Here we go. Here come the shoulders...",
        "(The baby starts crying, and the doctor holds it up.)",

        "Monica: (to the doctor) Wait, did you know it was twins?",
        "Doctor: Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.",
        "Monica: (to Erica) Anybody tell you?",
        "Erica: I don't think so. Although, they did mention something about two heartbeats. But I thought that was just mine and the baby's. They kept saying both heartbeats are really strong, and I thought well, that's good 'cause I'm having a baby.",
        "Monica: This is unbelievable.",
        "Erica: Twins actually run in my family.",
        "Chandler: Interesting! (To Monica) Can I see you for a second?",

        "Chandler: Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one?",
        "Monica: We can't split them up!",
        "Chandler: Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean, that's a great day for everybody.",
        "Monica: Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?",
        "Chandler: What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?",
        "Monica: Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt.",
        "Chandler: Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!",
        "Monica: That doesn't matter! We have waited so long for this. I don't care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies! I don't care if the entire cast of \"Eight is Enough\" comes out of there! We are taking them home, because they are our children!",
        "Chandler: (smiles) Okay. Shhh...",
        "(He hugs her.)",
        "Chandler: Okay.",
        "Monica: Okay!",

        "Joey: Oh my God! What did you say?",
        "Ross: Nothing! What do you say to that?",
        "Phoebe: Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel!",
        "Ross: No way!",
        "Joey: You can't just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do?",
        "Ross: What?",
        "Joey: Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language.",
        "Phoebe: Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. If she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go.",
        "Ross: You really think so?",
        "Phoebe: I'm telling you! Oh, okay! This is the part of the musical where there'd be a really good convincing song. (Singing) \"Bam-bam, don't take no for an answer. Bam-bam, don't let love fly away. Bam-bam-bam-bam...\"",

        "Ross: Okay.",
        "Joey: Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?",
        "Rachel: No, we decided that I would go ahead and set up first, and then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.",
        "Phoebe: Wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? Good luck, mom.",
        "Rachel: Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins? Good luck, Emma!",
        "(Rachel walks up to the counter.)",

        "Ross: What? What?",
        "Joey: Could you get me a muffin?",

        "Rachel: Yeah?",
        "Gunther: I... I know you're leaving tonight, but I just have to tell you. I love you.",
        "(Ross is shocked.)",
        "Gunther: I... I don't know if that changes your plans at all, but I thought you should know.",
        "Rachel: (touched) Gunther... Oh... I love you too. Probably not in the same way, but I do. And, and when I'm in a caf\u00e9, having coffee, or I see a man with hair brighter than the sun, I'll think of you. Aw.",
        "(She kisses him on the cheek and looks over at the others.)",

        "Monica: Do you think they recognize each other from in there?",
        "Chandler: Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a v*g1n* and they meet.",
        "Nurse: We're going to take Erica to recovery now.",
        "Monica: There's something that we wanna tell you. We decided to name the girl-baby Erica.",
        "Erica: Oh my God, that's just like my name!",
        "Monica: Son of a gun, it is!",
        "Erica: Anyway, I'm gonna go and get some rest. I'm really glad I picked you guys. You're gonna make great parents. Even Chandler.",

        "Phoebe: What?",
        "Joey: Why not?",
        "Ross: Because she's just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun.",
        "Phoebe: How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you slept together last night.",
