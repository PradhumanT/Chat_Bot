        "Rachel: Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring, the better I look. So, Monica? Chandler?",
        "Chandler: (glaring at her) Well, Monica and Chandler can't go. We're going to dinner remember?!",
        "Rachel: Oh my God, I'm so sorry.",

        "Ross: I'm sorry, it's just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp-to be a counselor!",
        "Monica: Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?",
        "Chandler: Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn't agree to that!",
        "Monica: Do you really see this as a long-term thing?",
        "Ross: I don't know.",
        "Phoebe: Y'know, you are 12 years older than her.",
        "Ross: Wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way?",
        "All: Yeah! Yeah, sort of. I'm sorry.",
        "Ross: Uh-uh-Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it doesn't really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I'm the one dating Elizabeth, not you!",
        "Joey: That's not what she said last night. (Ross glares at him.)",

        "Ross: Yeah, yeah you have the ring?",
        "Chandler: Yeah, right here in my pocket. (Pats his pocket. Phoebe smiles, goes over to hug him, and removes the ring from his pocket.) Pheebs?",
        "Phoebe: Oh! Oop! (Hands him back the ring.)",
        "Chandler: Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she's gonna know.",

        "Phoebe: So now what's going on here?",
        "Rachel: Uh well, uh this is a silent auction. They lay out all the stuff here and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it.",

        "Rachel: Well, y'know I-I don't know where he is.",
        "Mr. Thompson: Well, I hope you're gonna bid on some things Rachel.",
        "Rachel: Well, y'know what? Actually, I was about to bid on this lovely trip to Paris.",

        "Zoe: Shut the door! Shut the door!! (Runs over and closes the door.)",

        "Ross: Oh, you have to call the police! That's what I did to the kids in my building!",
        "Elizabeth: No, it's a water balloon fight! We started it!",
        "Ross: Oh! (Does a laugh/groan.) Listen umm, I, I just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight. Umm, it's supposed to be excellent. The director is the same...",
        "Elizabeth: (ignoring him and picking up a pitcher) Who drank all the Kamikazes?",
        "Sarah: (approaching with two filled balloons in her hands) Nobody! We put them in here! (Indicates the aforementioned balloons causing both of them to scream in delight and start drinking from the balloons.)",
        "Elizabeth: (To Ross) You want some?! (Starts to squirt the Kamikaze at him.)",

        "Second Dorm Guy: Put your balloons down!",
        "The Girls: You put your balloons down!!",
        "First Dorm Guy: You put your balloons down!!",
        "(Both opposing camps start screaming at each other to drop their weapons and surrender. Finally, Ross steps in as a mediator.)",

        "Phoebe: You just can't stand anyone else enjoying themselves can't you?",
        "Mr. Thompson: And finally, our biggest item of the night, the 22-foot gentleman's day sailer sailboat. The winning bid was a whooping $20,000! (Joey suddenly gets excited.)",
        "Joey: I won! That was my guess!",
        "Rachel: What?! What?! What?!",
        "Joey: I guessed 20,000!",
        "Rachel: Joey! It is an auction! You don't guess, you buy!",
        "Joey: What?! I don't have 20,000!",

        "Monica: What are you doing?",
        "Chandler: (trying to cover up why his hand is over his heart) One nation, under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. (Laughs.) I remembered it. (It's a butchered version of the Pledge of Allegiance of the United States for our foreign friends.) The champagne is here. (The waiter is delivering it and pouring two glasses.)",

        "Chandler: Yes! Yes! I'm good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything-are you-are you perrr-perfect?!",
        "Monica: Yeah. I'm okay. I'm actually-I'm a little cold, can I have your jacket?",
        "Chandler: Oh, yeah. (Starts to take it off and then realizes) Uh, no you can't have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you should've brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay?",
        "Monica: (laughs) Are you sure you're okay?",
        "Chandler: Yes! I'm fine. In fact I've been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.",
        "Monica: Ohh that's sweet!",
        "Chandler: Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn't imagine growing old with...",
        "(As he's talking Monica notices someone familiar has just entered the restaurant. Let's see; I seem to remember him driving a Ferrari in Hawaii solving crimes as a private investigator and as a certain eye doctor in more recent times.)",

        "Rachel: Phoebe, don't you think you've had enough to drink?",
        "Phoebe: I'm just helping the kids!",
        "Rachel: How is you drinking helping the kids?",
        "Phoebe: Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.",
        "Mr. Thompson: (approaching) Mr. Tribbiani.",
        "Joey: Oh hi!",
        "Mr. Thompson: Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building the youth center.",
        "Joey: Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?",
        "Mr. Thompson: I think it was valued at 19,000",
        "Joey: (To Rachel) Hey, I was pretty close. (She just glares at him.) Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can't buy the boat, I don't have any money.",
        "(Mr. Thompson looks shocked and at Rachel, she suddenly starts laughing.)",
        "Rachel: Joey! Joey, good one! (Mr. Thompson starts to laugh.)",
        "Mr. Thompson: That's good. Very good! (Walks away.)",
        "(After he's left, Rachel stops laughing and glares at Joey again.)",
        "Joey: So uh listen, I think I'm gonna take off now. (Starts to get up.)",
        "Rachel: (stopping him) Hey! You...can't...leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!",
        "Joey: Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don't have that kind of money!",
        "Rachel: I know. Okay. (Whispering and thinking.) Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what we're gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you're just gonna pay the difference.",
        "Joey: Okay.",
        "Rachel: Okay.",
        "Joey: Look, I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Y'know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!",
        "Rachel: Not great.",

        "Monica: Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can't get out of!",
        "Ross: Y'know, maybe she is too young for me. Y'know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don't know what to do.",
        "Monica: Why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first (looks at Chandler and pauses) weighing stuff.",
        "Ross: Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I'm-I'm 12 years older than she is.",

        "Monica: Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, \"Do you see a future?\" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? (Ross pauses in consideration.) Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn't you?!",
        "Ross: No! No! I...didn't do that. It's just... Okay, honestly no. I don't, I don't see a big future with her.",
