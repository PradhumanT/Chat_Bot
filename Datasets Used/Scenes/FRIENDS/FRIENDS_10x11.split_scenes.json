        "Roy: Didn't do anything? I took a bus all the way from Hoboken. I climbed ... I dunno... like a billion stairs... It's not like I can take them two at a time!",
        "Phoebe: I don't care. We're not paying you 300 dollars for this.",
        "Roy: Well, look - it's not my fault if you're too uptight to appreciate the male form in all it's glory.",
        "Phoebe: Oh yeah, okay. I'm uptight. Yeah, that's why I don't want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what I can only assume is a child halloween costume! (turns to look at Monica and Rachel who look like they feel very sorry for the stripper)",
        "Roy: I may have borrowed this from my nephew, but let me assure you, what's underneath (points at his groin)... is all man.",

        "Joey: Oh, .. uh... uh... pass. (Next word: \"Rotunda\") Pass. (Next word: \"Filibuster\" stares at it a moment) Pass. (Henrietta is looking very confused) (Next word: \"Addendum\" 4 seconds remaining) Okay, the little thing that hangs down at the back of your throat.",
        "Henrietta: Uvula!",
        "Joey: Oh, then pass. (Next word: \"Joint session\", but time's up, Joey acts very disappointed)",
        "Donny: O-kay... Henrietta, you didn't get all the points you needed, so that means Gene, you are going to the winners circle to try for ten thousand dollars!
