        "At Christmastime, Monica, strapped for cash, tips people using home-baked cookies, receiving mixed reactions. Phoebe discovers that the framed picture of her father that her grandmother keeps in her apartment is actually the photo model. She tries locating her real father, then decides she is unready to meet him. Chandler and Joey delayed Christmas shopping and scrounge gifts from a gas station. To win back Rachel, Ross asks her to make a list about him, then is offended when she calls him obsessive, among other things."

        "GRANDMOTHER: Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame.",
        "PHOEBE: Oh God.",
        "GRANDMOTHER: It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but harder.",
        "PHOEBE: Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?",
        "GRANDMOTHER: Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.",

        "CHANDLER: Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.",
        "RACHEL: Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.",

You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair.",
        "ROSS: See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said.",
        "RACHEL: Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross. [she walks off and Ross puts his hand to his hair]",

        "GRANDMOTHER: C'mon now Phoe, don't still be mad at me. How's it going?",
        "PHOEBE: Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math.",
        "GRANDMOTHER: Well, I think you're better off without him. Oh honey, I know he's your daddy but, but to me he's still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole her Gremlin.",
        "PHOEBE: No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.",
        "GRANDMOTHER: I know. OK, I wasn't completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I didn't know exactly where he lived.",
        "PHOEBE: Whattaya mean?",
        "GRANDMOTHER: He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown. If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've gone too far. You can take my cab.",
        "PHOEBE: Wow. Thank you.",
        "GRANDMOTHER: Now, remember, nobody else drives that cab.",
