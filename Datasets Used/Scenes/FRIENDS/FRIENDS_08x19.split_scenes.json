        "Monica: Three down knows I'm married, what's three down doin'?",
        "Rachel: So did they call you to tell you your name's gonna be in this?",
        "Joey: No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no.",
        "Ross: Why'd you say no?",
        "Joey: Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.",
        "Chandler: If only there was something in your head to control the things you say. (Joey nods his agreement.)",
        "Rachel: Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus y'know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you can mention, oh I don't know, gal pal Rachel Green?",
        "Chandler: Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?",
        "Rachel: Okay, don't listen to him. Please?",
        "Joey: Fine! All right, I'll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I y'know, start to say something stupid.",
        "Ross: Just then or-or all the time, 'cause we-we have jobs y'know.",
        "Rachel: Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal Rachel Green. (Excited) Ha-ha! I'm gonna be in Soap Opera Digest! And not just in the dumb crossword puzzle. (Looks at Joey.) Seriously, proud of you.",

        "Mike: And there is Kevin.",
        "[Cut forward.]",
        "Mike: This is the first time he's ever used this product, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. (To Kevin) Go ahead. ('Kevin' starts using the product, it is a spout that you jab into a paper milk carton so that you don't have to rip it open.) This works with any milk carton.",
        "Joey: (finishing installing the Milk Master 2000) Wow, it is easy. (Starts to poor the milk) Now, I can have milk everyday.",
