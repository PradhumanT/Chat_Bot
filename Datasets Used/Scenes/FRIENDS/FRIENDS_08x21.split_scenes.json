        "Ross: Hey you guys I got some bad news. (He sets the stack of papers down on the table.)",
        "Phoebe: Well that's no way to sell newspapers. Why don't you try, \"Extra! Extra! Read all about it!\"",
        "Ross: No, Monica's restaurant got a horrible review in the Post. (They all gasp.) I didn't want her to see it, so I ran around the neighborhood and bought all the copies I could find. (He hands the paper to Phoebe and they all read it.)",
        "Joey: Man, this is bad! And I've had my share of bad reviews. I still remember my first good one though. (Quoting) \"Everything else in this production of Our Town was simply terrible. Joey Tribbiani was abysmal.\"",
        "Monica: (entering) Hey!",
        "Chandler: Hey.",
        "Monica: (seeing the stack of newspapers) Oh my God! Look at all the newspapers! It must be a good review! Is it great?!",
        "Ross: Umm...",
        "Monica: (reading) Oh dear God!",
        "Ross: But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know.",
        "Monica: What about the rest of Manhattan?!",
        "Ross: Yeah, they all know.",
        "Monica: Oh my God, this is horrible!",

        "Monica: You don't think that umm, (reading) \"The chef's Mahi Mahi was awful awful,\" is bad press?",
        "Rachel: I didn't write it.",
        "Monica: Is he right? Am I really-Am I awful?",
        "All: No!",
        "Joey: Yeah! Yeah Monica! You listen to me, okay? And I'm not just saying this because I'm your friend, I'm sayin' it 'cause it's the truth. You're food is abysmal!",

        "Rachel: I am freaking out!",
        "Ross: Are ya?",
        "Rachel: My due date is in one week!",
        "Ross: What are you doing up?",
        "Rachel: That is seven days!",

        "Rachel: (interrupting him) No-no-no-no-no Ross! Please, come on we do not have any of the big stuff we need! We do not a changing table! We do not have a crib! We do not have a diaper service!",
        "Ross: It's funny you should mention diapers.",
        "Rachel: I'm serious.",
        "Ross: Okay look, there's nothing to worry about. We have plenty of time. There's a great baby furniture store on west 10th. Tomorrow, we will go there and we will get you everything that you need. Okay?",
        "Rachel: Okay. Thank you. That's great. Thank you. Wait-wait! Where on west 10th? Because there's this really cute shoe store that has like this little...",
        "Ross: (interrupting her) Okay. Okay. If uh, if you're gonna do this, then I'm gonna do that. (Points to the bathroom.) So... (Starts for the bathroom.)",
        "Rachel: (stopping him) Oh, wait Ross! I'm sorry, one more thing!",
        "Ross: (annoyed) Yeah!",
        "Rachel: Umm, our situation. Y'know umm, what we mean to each other. And I mean we-we're having this baby together, and we live together. Isn't that, isn't that weird?",

        "Joey: Okay, I'll see you there. (Starts to leave)",
        "Monica: Joey! (He returns) Now that you're here...",
        "Joey: Sure, I can hang out 'til I have to meet ya. (To Chandler) What uh-How come you're not going?",
        "Chandler: I have a job interview I have to get ready for.",
        "Joey: I thought you already have a job.",
        "Chandler: And people say you don't pay attention. No, this is a much better job. It's vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.",
        "Joey: Wow! How do you know how to do that?!",
        "Chandler: That's what I do now.",
        "Monica: Hey Joey, come taste this.",
        "Joey: What is it?",
        "Monica: Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well... (Feeds him a spoonful of what she's cooking.) I'm getting my revenge!",
        "Joey: You cooked him?",
        "Monica: No. He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bollet base again. Oh, I cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow! \"Restaurant reviewer admits: I was wrong about Monica.\"",
        "Chandler: The front page? You really do live in your own little world, don't ya?",

        "Ross: We are having a baby together, but we're not involved. (The cashier, a very beautiful woman, looks confused) I mean, uh we-we were seeing each other a while ago, but then we were just friends. And then there was one drunken night. (Rachel looks at him angrily) Or, yes stranger, we'd like this delivered please.",
        "Cashier: Why don't you fill out this address card. (Hands him one.)",
        "Ross: Oh, okay.",
        "Cashier: I notice you picked out a lot of our dinosaur items.",
        "Rachel: Oh yeah! Actually, that's one of the reasons why we're not a couple.",
        "Ross: I chose those, I'm a paleontologist.",
        "Cashier: Really?! That is so cool!",
        "Rachel: Oh. Oh yeah, don't get to worked up over it. I mean it-it sounds like he's a doctor, but he's not.",
        "Cashier: Oh no-no, I'm fascinated by paleontology. Have you read the new Walter Alvarez book?",
        "Ross: Yeah! I-I teach it in my class.",
        "Rachel: Oh my God! I'm standing at a cash register, holding a credit card, and I'm bored.",
        "Cashier: (looking at the completed address card) Oh, I love your neighborhood. There's a great gym right around the corner from your building.",
        "Ross: That's my gym.",
        "Cashier: I can tell you work out. (Ross is please and Rachel looks at him confused.) A paleontologist who works out, you're like Indiana Jones. (Rachel has a disbelieving look on her face.)",
        "Ross: I am like Indiana Jones.",
        "[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is there as Rachel enters.]",
        "Rachel: Hi Pheebs!",
        "Phoebe: Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?",
        "Rachel: Oh, it was great! We got everything that we needed! Oh and Ross, almost got something that wasn't on the list. A whore.",
        "Phoebe: What?!",
        "Rachel: Well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started flirting with him.",
        "Phoebe: Well did she know you two weren't married?",
        "Rachel: Yeah.",
        "Phoebe: Oh my God! Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man, we-we must alert the church elders!",
        "Rachel: You don't understand! You didn't see how brazen she was.",
        "Phoebe: Sounds like you're a little jealous.",
        "Rachel: No! I'm not! I-I-I just think it's wrong! It's-it's that I'm-Here I am about to pop and he's out picking up some shop girl at Sluts 'R' Us!",
        "Phoebe: Is that a real place? (Rachel's stunned) Are they hiring?",
        "Chandler: (entering) Hey Phoebe! (To Rachel) Fatty!",
        "Phoebe: Hey Chandler, why so fancy?",
        "Chandler: Well, I got a job interview. It's kinda a big deal too. Its a lot more money and I'd be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.",
        "Phoebe: Wait, I think I know someone who does that.",
        "Chandler: Me! I do that. So... Seriously, do I look okay? I'm little nervous.",
        "Rachel: Oh yeah! You really-You look great.",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, just don't get your hopes up.",
        "Chandler: Why not?",
        "Phoebe: Well, the interview...",
        "Chandler: What about it?",
        "Phoebe: Y'know! You don't make a very good first impression.",
        "Chandler: (shocked) What?!",
        "Phoebe: Oh you don't know.",
        "Chandler: Are you serious?!",
        "Phoebe: Yes, when I first met you, you were like, \"Blah, blah, blah.\" I was like, shhh!",
        "Chandler: What is it that I do?",
        "Phoebe: Well it's just like you're trying too hard. Always making jokes, y'know, you just-You come off a little needy.",
        "Chandler: (To Rachel) Did you like me when we first met?",
        "Rachel: Chandler, I'm not gonna lie to ya, but I am gonna run away from you. (Gets up and hurries out.)",

        "The Food Critic: Still?",
        "Monica: I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my boule base another chance.",
        "The Food Critic: I don't see any reason why I would do that to myself again.",
        "Joey: Either eat it, or be in it.",
        "Monica: Spoon? (Hands him one and he tastes it.) So, what do you think?",
        "The Food Critic: I'm torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal. (Throws down the spoon and walks out.)",
        "Joey: Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; there's a new class comin' in.",
        "(They start to leave.)",
        "The Cooking Teacher: Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start, can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bournese sauce? (No one can.)",
        "Monica: I can.",
        "The Cooking Teacher: Okay, go ahead.",
        "Monica: Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bournese has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly teradyne.",
        "The Cooking Teacher: That's very good, what's your name?",
        "Monica: Monica.",
        "The Cooking Teacher: Monica, you go to the head of the class.",

        "Ross: My son? Pretty serious. (There's a knock on the door and Ross answers it.) Oh hey Katie! (The cashier from before) What uh, what are you doing here?",
        "Katie: Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this. (A blanket.)",
        "Ross: Ah, must've been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.",
        "Katie: Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job description.",
        "Ross: Oh. (Reaches into his pocket for some money as Rachel enters the living room and watches holding two stuffed dinosaurs.)",
        "Katie: Oh uh...I actually came here to ask you out.",

(Katie's worried again.) I'm not-I'm not into anything weird. Y'know? Just-just normal s*x. (Katie is uncomfortable.) So, I'm gonna grab my coat. (Does so, leaving Katie and Rachel alone.)",
        "Rachel: So, you had a good day huh? Big commission; picked up a daddy.",

        "Chandler: Oh good. Good, because I'm sure this interview is gonna last a couple of weeks.",
        "Phoebe: All right, don't freak out! Okay? I-I will help you. How long before you have to leave?",

        "The Cooking Teacher: Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?",
        "Joey: When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?",
        "The Cooking Teacher: And the cream?",

        "Phoebe: Um-hmm, that's good to know. But let's stop focusing on what you don't do, and start focusing on what you do do.",
        "Chandler: (suppressing a smile) What I do do...is manage to uh, create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me.",

        "Rachel: Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because I don't want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know it's a terrible thing to even think this, and it's completely inappropriate, but I want you to be at my constant beck and call 24 hours a day! I'm very sorry, but that is just the way that I feel.",
