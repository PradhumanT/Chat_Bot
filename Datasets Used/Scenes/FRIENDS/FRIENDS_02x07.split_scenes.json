    "Recap": [
        "Rachel goes on a date but after drinking too much wine, obsesses about Ross. Her date suggests she needs closure, so Rachel leaves a message on Ross' answering machine claiming she is \"over\" him. After hearing it the next morning, a stunned Ross wrestles with choosing her or Julie. Chandler gains a few pounds, so a depressed, out-of-work Monica volunteers to be his personal trainer, going overboard in the process. Phoebe takes Joey's advice when her new boyfriend is reluctant to sleep with her, only to have it backfire. Ross, upset and citing numerous reasons, tells Rachel it is too late for them to be together and he is staying with Julie. At the end of the episode, Ross goes to see Rachel at the coffee shop as she is closing up, and they passionately kiss."

        "RACH: Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?",

        "JOEY: And what did he say?",
        "PHOE: He said that, um, he understands how s*x can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.",
        "JOEY: Wow.",
        "PHOE: Yeah, so I said, \"OK, relax please,\" y'know, I mean, s*x can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.",
        "JOEY: Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.",

        "ROSS: I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.",
        "RACH: Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?",
        "ROSS: Then you should have said something before I met her.",
        "RACH: I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.",
        "ROSS: There was never a good time.",
        "RACH: Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.",
        "ROSS: Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys.",
        "RACH: Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?",
        "ROSS: The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.",
        "RACH: Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?",
        "ROSS: Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.",
