        "[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the gang is there eating breakfast. Chandler is cleaning out his wallet.]",
        "Phoebe: Hey! New wallet, huh?",
        "Chandler: Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn't say 'cool' anymore.",
        "Monica: Rachel!",
        "Rachel: What?",
        "Monica: You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!",
        "Rachel: Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.",
        "Monica: Have you ever taken out the trash? (Hands her the garbage.)",
        "Rachel: Well, I thought you liked doing it. (Rachel starts out the door and stops.)",
        "Monica: Third door on the left.",
        "Rachel: Right!",
        "[Scene: Garbage room: Mr. Treeger is unclogging the trash chute as Rachel enters.]",
        "Rachel: Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.",
        "Mr. Treeger:: Hey.",
        "(Rachel opens the trash chute, winces at the smell, and throws the garbage bag in. She then tries to throw the pizza box in, but since it's so big she jams it into the opening and it prevents the door from closing. She then turns around too see Mr. Treeger watching her.)",
        "Mr. Treeger:: What are you doing?",
        "Rachel: Ummm. Oh! I'm sorry. (She grabs the box and offers him a piece.) It's a little old but...",
        "Mr. Treeger:: No! You're clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour unclogging!",
        "Rachel: I'm sorry. I didn't-I don't come in here a lot.",
        "Mr. Treeger:: Oh yeah, of course you don't!",
        "Rachel: No.",
        "Mr. Treeger:: 'Cause you're a little princess! \"Daddy, buy me a pizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of Cats sing Happy Birthday to me...\"",
        "Rachel: I didn't... I never said that.",
        "Mr. Treeger:: You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh? Well, why don't think of someone else for a change?",
        "Rachel: (starting to cry) Okay, I'm sorry. (Runs out still carrying the pizza box.)",
        "[Cut to Monica and Rachel's apartment as Rachel returns in tears.]",
        "Monica: God! If you're gonna cry about it! (She grabs the box and goes to through it out.]",

        "Joey: Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?",
        "Rachel: Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.",
        "Joey: I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.",
        "Monica: Joey, please don't do that. I think it's best that we just forget about it.",
        "Rachel: That's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed.",
        "Joey: All right that's it, school is in session! (Exits and slams the door.)",
        "Monica: (Picking up a card from Chandler's wallet.) My God! Is this a gym card?",
        "Chandler: Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times.",
        "Ross: So why don't you quit?",
        "Chandler: You don't think I've tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.",
        "Ross: Who is Maria?",
        "Chandler: Oh Maria. You can't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gym...treat.",
        "Ross: You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?",
        "Chandler: No!",
        "Ross: So you're strong enough to face her on your own?",
        "Chandler: Oh no, you'll have to come.",
        "[Scene: Treeger's apartment, Joey knocks on the door and Treeger opens it.]",
        "Mr. Treeger:: Tribbiani! Hold on, I'll get the plunger.",
        "Joey: Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you're gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.",
        "Mr. Treeger:: And tell him what?",
        "Joey: Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.",
        "Mr. Treeger:: Yeah. Well maybe you have heard about the Rent Stabilization Act of 1968!",
        "Joey: I have actually not heard of that.",
        "Mr. Treeger:: Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it. I've been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don't need this grief. I'm gonna call the landlord and tell him that Monica is illegally subletting here grandmother's apartment. Your friends are outta here pal.",
        "Joey: Why don't you tell me something I don't know! (He storms out, and once Treeger closes the door behind him, Joey makes an 'Oops!' have.)",
        "[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier, everyone is still eating breakfast.]",
        "Phoebe: Oh please, somebody tell me I don't have to go to work today!",

        "Phoebe: Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I'm not allowed to charge for.",
        "Monica: So do them for free.",
        "Phoebe: Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it's against my oath as a masseuse.",
        "Ross: They make you take an oath?",
        "Phoebe: No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one's actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.",
        "Chandler: Why don't you just give him to somebody else?",
        "Phoebe: No, I can handle it. No, I'm a professional. (She starts to leave)",
        "Rachel: Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?",

        "Rachel: Oh! My hero! What happened?",
        "Joey: Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he'd better come up here and apologize. I'll see you later. (Starts to leave)",
        "Monica: What a minute, what did he say?",
        "Joey: He said that he wasn't gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he's gonna do is have you evicted-I'll see you later.",
        "Rachel: What?! You got us evicted!!",
        "Monica: I told you not to go down there!",
        "Joey: Well he made Rachel cry!",
        "Monica: Rachel always cries!",
        "Rachel: That's not true! (Starts to cry.)",
        "Monica: Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you've never sucked before!",
        "Joey: All right! I'll try! But if I can't, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.",
        "Rachel: Go!!",
        "Joey: All right, all right, all right. (Starts to leave, stops, and turns around) I mean I'll have to check with him first, but I'll think he'll be cool with it. (Monica shoos him out.)",
