        "After getting his big break with Days of Our Lives, Joey pays Chandler back with $812 and gives him an engraved gold bracelet that Chandler thinks makes him look gay. Joey's feelings are hurt when he overhears Chandler complaining about it. Also, an unemployed Monica is hard up for money. A home video from Monica and Rachel's prom night reveals that Monica was previously overweight and Rachel had a large nose. Rachel's date, Chip, seemed to have stood her up, so Ross donned his father's tuxedo to take her to the prom, though Chip showed up at the last minute without Rachel knowing what Ross did. Rachel, overwhelmed by Ross' gesture, kisses him. In 1997, TV Guide ranked this episode at #100 of its list of TV's 100 Greatest Episodes. [4]"

        "JOEY: If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.",
        "CHANDLER: Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?",
        "JOEY: Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?",
        "CHANDLER: OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that.

        "MONICA: Where have you been?",
        "ROSS: Emotional hell. So, did they lend you the money yet?",
        "MONICA: No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.",
        "ROSS: C'mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news.",
        "MONICA: Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it.",

        "MONICA and ROSS: In the bank.",
        "MR. GELLER: There you go. So she dips into her savings, that's what it's there for. She's gonna be fine, and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it. [pulls a quarter from behind her ear]",

        "CHANDLER: I can't believe it.",
        "PHOEBE: Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.",
        "CHANDLER: Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay. [sits down at the bar]",
        "RACHEL: [comes up from behind the bar and startles Chandler] Hey. I've got something that's gonna make you happy. Guess what Gunther found? [holds up Chandler's bracelet]",
        "PHOEBE: Hey now you have two. [Chandler looks annoyed] Oh, now you have two.",

        "JOEY: Get out.",
        "CHANDLER: No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, [puts bracelet on Joey] it's about you and me and the fact that we're [reading bracelet] best buds.",
        "JOEY: Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.",
