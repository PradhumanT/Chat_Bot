    "Recap": [
        "A record producer discovers Phoebe and wants to make her song \"Smelly Cat\" as a music video. The producer secretly dubs a more talented (but less attractive) woman's voice over Phoebe's, though Phoebe initially believes she is the one singing. Ross' new relationship with Rachel causes friction with Monica who resents her brother being around all the time. Joey finds he does not like living alone and wants to move back in with Chandler. However Chandler already has a new roommate, Eddie. Chandler soon realizes he does not really click with Eddie (who refuses to play foosball and dislikes Baywatch ) like he did with Joey."
