        "[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is talking to Ross]",
        "Joey: There's this woman, that I like. A lot. Well, it's complicated. She's with this other guy. For a long time. And I could never do that to the guy, y'know? 'Ccause we're really good friends.",
        "Ross: So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh... is he a good guy?",
        "Joey: Yeah, he's the best.",
        "Ross: Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.",
        "Joey: Oh, I don't know.",
        "Ross: Joey, it's worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.",
        "Joey: I do! So much! I can't stop thinking about her! I can't sleep, I-",
        "Ross: Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself. (Walks towards the door until...)",
        "Joey: It's Rachel.",
        "[Fade to Black, then fade in again with Ross stopped at the doorway.]",
        "Ross: (closes the door) Did you um-I'm sorry, did you just say it's Rachel?",
        "Joey: Yes.",
        "Ross: Um, you...you like Rachel?",
        "Joey: Yes. I like Rachel.",
        "Ross: Rachel?!",
        "Joey: (startled) Yeah, okay but look, buy uh-Hey-hey, y'know, y'know who else I like? You! And it-it doesn't get said enough. I like you Ross.",
        "Ross: But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?!",
        "Joey: Yeah, but it's not a big deal.",
        "Ross: It's not a big deal? Oh, I'm sorry I just...um, I...what about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I like-you-you can't stop thinking about her. Like how you can't sleep?",
        "Joey: I'm an actor, y'know? As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic.",
        "Ross: Rachel who's carrying my baby? Rachel?",
        "Joey: Look no, I-I know it's bad, and I know it's wrong. Okay? But-but it's not like anything's ever gonna happen. Y'know? These-these are just feelings, they're gonna go away.",
        "Ross: Y'know what? I-I gotta go. (Starts to leave.)",
        "Joey: Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross don't...",
        "Ross: (stops) I just-y'know-I-I just have one-Rachel?!",
        "(He exits and starts to walk away, passes a window, stops, and says \"Rachel?!\" again. Joey sighs and turns around to face Gunther.)",

        "[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel and Chandler are on the couch.]",
        "Rachel: Oh-oh! Okay, she's kicking!",
        "Chandler: Oh! (Puts his hand on her belly.) She's growing inside you.",
        "Rachel: Whoa!!",
        "Chandler: Oh! (Pulls his hand away.)",
        "Rachel: Wow that was a big one.",
        "Chandler: I think that's the youngest girl ever to reject me.",
        "Phoebe: (entering) Oh hey you guys!",
        "Chandler: Oh hey!",
        "Rachel: Hi!",
        "Phoebe: Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?",
        "Rachel: Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That's why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He'll find me.",
        "Phoebe: Uh-huh, (To Chandler) and you?",
        "Chandler: No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don't think they exist.",
        "Phoebe: Okay, good.",
        "Chandler: Why?",
        "Phoebe: Well last night, I met Monica's.",
        "Chandler: What?",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other half.",
        "Chandler: Come on, don't be crazy. (To Rachel) You don't think there's someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya? (Rachel looks at him.)",
        "Rachel: (To Phoebe) Well, what's he like?!",
        "Phoebe: Well he's tall.",
        "Rachel: Uh-huh.",
        "Phoebe: He has brown hair.",
        "Rachel: Of course, of course.",
        "Chandler: A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!",
        "Phoebe: He works with food!",
        "Rachel: Oh sure. Older?",
        "Phoebe: Obviously, and he's British.",
        "Rachel: Oh, I was just gonna ask!",
        "Phoebe: Yeah? And, he's-he's so centered and mature and confident.",
        "Rachel: Oh, it's so sad they never had a chance to meet.",
        "Chandler: Luckily, the guy she settled for can't hear what you're talking about.",
        "Phoebe: Oh, I'm so sorry. Um, and maybe I'm wrong! I but-y'know I'm gonna go out with him again, I'll find out more.",
        "Chandler: You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you're still gonna date him?",
        "Phoebe: Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl's gotta eat.",
        "[Scene: Ross and Rachel's, Ross is opening the door to Monica.]",
        "Monica: Hey.",
        "Ross: Hey.",
        "Monica: I just talked to Joey, I just-I want to see how you were.",
        "Ross: Oh y'know, I still-I can't believe it. Joey and Rachel I mean it's... It's like you and me going out, only weirder!",
        "Monica: All right, I know you're hurting, and-and I want to be supportive, but don't say that again.",
        "Ross: Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then he'd be the stepfather of my child.",
        "Monica: Honey, I don't think that's something we need to worry about! First of all he's-he's never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if he did you have no idea how she'd react.",
        "Ross: Sure, because women never like Joey. Y'know, I think he's a virgin.",
        "Monica: Joey...he's not even thinking about going after Rachel!",
        "Ross: He's not?",
        "Monica: No! All he's thinking about is how you're taking this! I mean, listen it's totally freaking him out. He's talking about moving to Vermont.",
        "Ross: Why?",
        "Monica: He says he wants to leave the country. (Pause) He thinks you hate him.",
        "Ross: Hate him? I... No, I don't hate him. (Pause) It's just it's Rachel, y'know?",
        "Monica: Honey I can't even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I don't want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that you're still his friend.",
        "Ross: Okay. Okay, I'll talk to him.",
        "Monica: All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money.",
        "[Scene: Central Perk, Monica and Chandler are on the couch as Phoebe enters with Monica's soul mate.]",
        "Phoebe: Oh! Hi!",
        "Monica: Hi!",
        "Phoebe: Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.",
        "Don: Oh, hello. (Shakes Chandler's hand.) Hello. (Shakes Monica's hand.)",
        "Phoebe: (mouths to Chandler) Soul mate.",
        "Chandler: (mouths to Phoebe) What?",
        "Phoebe: (cough talks) Soul mate.",
        "Monica: So, what have you guys been doing?",
        "Don: Well, we just had a terrible lunch today at Reattica. What is with all the sun-dried tomatoes at that place?",
        "Monica: I know! What is this, 1985?!",
        "Don: That's exactly what I said. Phoebe, isn't that strange.",
        "Monica: Not really.",
        "Chandler: What's wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? (Everyone stares at him.) On a barbecue chicken pizza? (Still there's staring.) No?",
        "Monica: So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?",
        "Don: Well, Octavio, 27&7-Oh! And there's this great little place, Alessandro's.",
        "Monica: Oh my God! That's my restaurant, I'm the chef there.",
        "Don: You're kidding me!",
        "Monica: No!",
        "Don: Your food is fantastic! Wow, I really want to talk to you about your menu, once I get some coffees first. Um, anyone want any?",
        "Monica: Oh, I'd like a latte. Oh y'know what? If you're gonna talk about me, I'm gonna go with you.",
        "(They go over to the counter and Chandler moves closer to Phoebe.)",
        "Chandler: What are you doing?!",
        "Phoebe: Nothing! I swear to God I didn't know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didn't believe in soul mates. So...",
        "Chandler: I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!",
        "Phoebe: They're just talking, and y'know what? Just because I think they're soul mates doesn't mean anything's gonna happen.",
        "Monica: (returning) Phoebe, good work.",
        "Phoebe: Yeah?",
        "Monica: Yeah! Oh he's great, I love him. (Walks away and Chandler glares at Phoebe.)",
        "Phoebe: Don't worry, we'll find you someone else.",
        "[Scene: Joey's Apartment, there's a knock on the door and Joey answers it to Ross.]",
        "Joey: Hey.",
        "Ross: Hey.",
        "Joey: Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.",
        "Ross: No, I don't want to hit you.",
        "Joey: Oh what then? Kick me?",
        "Ross: No.",
        "Joey: (getting worried) Bite me?",
        "Ross: No, no I don't want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to tell you that I'm not mad at you and...and that I certainly do not hate you. I just, I just came here to say that. (Starts to leave.)",
        "Joey: Oh now-Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?",
        "Ross: Uh...yeah sure. (Enters.)",
        "Joey: Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left. I don't...",
        "Ross: Okay.",
        "Joey: (pouring two glasses) Hey look Ross, you need to understand something okay? I uh...I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you. (He hands Ross a glass.)",
        "Ross: Thank you.",
        "(They clink glasses and take a drink. Ross likes it, Joey hates it. Then Ross sees Joey hating it, mimics he hates it as well.)",
        "Joey: Anyway, it uh...look it'll just...take me a while to get over her, that's all. I'm not even sure how to do that, I mean I've never been in love before so...",
        "Ross: What?! You're in love with her.",
        "Joey: Yeah, I thought you knew that.",
        "Ross: Umm, no.",
        "Joey: Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I don't want to feel this way. Honest. I just keep thinking, \"Ah, I'll get over this.\" Y'know? I just-It just keeps gettin' harder. I don't, I don't know what to do. Y'know? What do I do?",
        "(Pause)",
        "Ross: I think you need to tell her how you feel.",
        "Joey: Okay that's the green stuff talkin'.",
        "Ross: No, I'm serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if she's not where you are, then you can start to move past this.",
        "Joey: But what if uh-and I'm not saying she will be-But...",
        "Ross: If she is where you are then uh...then my feeling weird about it shouldn't stand in the way.",
        "Joey: Are you sure?",
        "Ross: Yeah. Look if-if she's gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldn't find a better guy. So...",
        "Joey: Hey thanks.",
        "Ross: So when do you think you're gonna talk to her?",
        "Joey: Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven't even thought about what I will say. What should I say?",
        "Ross: I'm understanding, but let's not get carried away.",
        "Joey: I'm sorry, you're right. What am I gonna say? (He takes another sip of the green stuff and recoils at the taste.) Oh!",
        "Ross: Yeah, tell me about it. (He stands up, turns his back to Joey, and enjoys another sip.)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe and Chandler are watching Monica and Don talk.]",
        "Don: ...so I've been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese side of things.",
        "Chandler: Cheese you say? That's some pretty smelly work, huh Don?",
        "Don: Excuse me?",
        "Chandler: Cheese, it's smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.",
        "Don: Uh, not really. But when it comes to cheese, I'm one of the people who thinks the smellier the better.",
        "Monica: Me too! Yeah, Chandler can't stand it. He won't even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.",
        "Don: And you're still married to him? (They both laugh, and Chandler tries to but fails.)",
        "Monica: You know what I'd love to do? I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheese-Not even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah. Ah, and pastries... (Breathlessly) And pate. Oh, I'm really not high, it's just I used to be fat.",
        "Don: Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know, I've got a great little villa you can stay at.",
        "Chandler: Is it made of cheese?",
        "Don: No. But God, a house made of cheese, wouldn't that be incredible?!",
        "Monica: I'd move in tomorrow!",
        "Chandler: (disgusted) Oh come on! (To Phoebe) Are you listening to this?",
        "Phoebe: I'm so sorry.",
        "Chandler: What do we do?",
        "Phoebe: I don't know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I don't know how you fight that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Scene: Outside Ross and Rachel's, Joey walks up to knock on the door, but stops.]",
        "Joey: Okay. Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just stand up straight. (Does so.) Take a couple deep breaths. (Does so.) Look confident. (Does so as Rachel opens the door and startles him.)",
        "Rachel: Joey? What's up?",
        "Joey: I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.",
        "Rachel: Okay what's up?",
        "Joey: Here? In the hall? What are we animals?",
        "Rachel: Well honey, I'm late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?",
        "Joey: Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that I...want to have dinner with you tonight. That's all.",
        "Rachel: Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you. Okay? (Walks away.)",
        "Joey: Okay. That's good. Okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what you're gonna say. Good. Yeah. (Someone comes out of his apartment and it startles Joey again.) Don't you people ever knock?!",
        "[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Chandler are entering.]",
        "Monica: I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldn't that be nice?",
        "Chandler: Sure, why don't you set it up. I'll just be over here, browsing through the personals.",
        "Monica: Are you okay? You've been acting weird all afternoon.",
        "Chandler: Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.",
        "Monica: Jeez! What is with you?",
        "Chandler: I'm sorry, did you say cheese?",
        "Monica: All right, what's going on?",
        "Chandler: Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don't believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I won't stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.",
        "Monica: Chandler, you don't believe in soul mates?",
        "Chandler: No. But I'm sure (mimics Don) 'tomatoes' does.",
        "Monica: I don't believe in soul mates either.",
        "Chandler: You don't?",
        "Monica: No. I don't think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard.",
        "Chandler: So you...you don't want to live with Don in a cheese house?",
        "Monica: No, I've had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard that would be to clean?",
        "Chandler: I love you.",
        "Monica: I know.",
        "Chandler: Y'know what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers . (Monica doesn't look impressed.) No? Really? They taste so good.",
        "[Scene: A restaurant, Joey and Rachel are having dinner.]",
        "Rachel: ...and I know Chandler is kidding but it happens every time he touches my stomach. I mean I'm really worried the baby's not going to like him. (Joey is staring at the table.) Are you okay?",
        "Joey: What? Yeah! Sure! Uh, look at the uh, the reason...(Exhales slowly)-Is it hot in here?",
        "Rachel: No. Not-not for me, but why don't you take off your sweater?",
        "Joey: I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbs.",
        "Rachel: Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?",
        "Joey: Yeah. Sure. (They both half stand up, Joey pulls the neck of his sweater out, and Rachel looks down it to see his T-shirt.)",
        "Rachel: Huh. Wow, I wouldn't think Hobbs would like that so much.",
        "Joey: Uh... How long have we known each other?",
        "Rachel: Um, seven...e-e-eight, eight years. Wow.",
        "Joey: Uh-huh, long time.",
        "Rachel: Yeah.",
        "Joey: But over the past few weeks...",
        "(A waiter runs over interrupting Joey.)",
        "Waiter: Hah, sorry about the wait, but it is mega-jammed in here! We have a couple specials tonight...",
        "Joey: Actually uh, could you give us a second?",
        "Waiter: Sure. Sure. (Turns away, then turns back) Second's up! (Joey glares at him.) Not...that kind of table. (He walks away.)",
        "Rachel: So you were saying?",
        "Joey: I'm not quite sure.",
        "Rachel: Okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and I said, \"Eight years.\" And the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, and umm...now here we are.",
        "Joey: Yeah, here we are. Uhh... I... I think I'm...falling in love with you.",
        "Rachel: (stunned) What?",
        "Joey: I'm falling in love with you.",
        "Rachel: (looking around) Who are you talking too? Oh, you're kidding! Oh, it's a joke! (Laughs.) It's funny. It's funny. I don't get it. (Joey doesn't say any thing and Rachel realizes it's not a joke.) Oh. (Pause) Okay. Umm... I-I...uh, wow. Are you uh... How did umm... When?",
        "Joey: Does it really matter?",
        "Rachel: Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow, it is hot in here.",
        "Joey: Okay look Rach, I know this is a lot. You don't have to say anything. You-you uh, you take as much time as you need. (Long pause as Rachel says nothing.) Okay, you gotta say something!",
        "Rachel: Joey, Joey I love you so much, but I...",
        "Joey: But. (Hangs his head down.)",
        "Rachel: Joey.",
        "Joey: Yeah-yeah right. That's okay. That's fine. That's uh, pretty much what I was expecting. So uh, it's no big deal. All right? I think I'm gonna go. (Stands up.)",
        "Rachel: No! Joey please! Please don't! Please don't leave like this! Now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman! (Starts to cry.)",
        "Joey: Don't start doing that. You can't do that Rach, 'cause then you're gonna make me do that. (Starts to cry.) Oh, here we go! (Sits down next to her.)",
        "Rachel: Can I? (Hug him.)",
        "Joey: Sure!",
        "(They hug.)",
        "Rachel: Oh Joey honey I don't...I don't want to lose...",
        "Joey: Hey-hey-hey, hey! You can't. Okay? Ever!",
        "Rachel: I'm so sorry.",
        "Joey: Oh no-no Rach, please, don't be sorry. Okay? Don't be sorry. (They hug again.) Y'know I was only kidding you.",
        "Rachel: Yeah, that was a real good one.",
        "Closing Credits",
        "[Scene: A restaurant, Joey and Rachel are still hugging as a waiter walks by the table to talk to the annoying waiter from before who is watching.]",
        "Waiter No. 2: Is this your table?",
        "Waiter: Yeah.",
        "Waiter No. 2: God, you're gonna be here all night!",
        "Waiter: I know! I haven't even read them the specials yet!",
        "Waiter No. 2: What's the matter with them?",
        "Waiter: I don't know. I think maybe one of them is dying. (Pause) I kinda hope it's the girl. (The other waiter is shocked.) The guy is really cute!"
