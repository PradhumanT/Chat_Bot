        "Chandler: Yeah!",
        "Phoebe: (returning with Joey) With what?",
        "Monica: Well, we're trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they're all either boring or annoying or y'know, can't stop staring at the ladies. (Points to her chest.)",
        "(Joey nods his approval.)",
        "Phoebe: Oo! You should have one of us do it!",
        "Monica: Phoebe, we're getting married, married; not sixth grade married.",
        "Phoebe: No! No! It's-it's uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!",

        "Rachel: Hey! We were not on a-Okay. That's fine! Fine. Y'know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?",
        "Ben: When's my daddy coming back?",
        "Rachel: (checks her watch) Fifty-two minutes. (Pause) So no-no brothers and sisters, huh? That must be nice. You don't have to share stuff.",
        "Ben: Sharing is good.",
        "Rachel: Oh, you're one of those. But y'know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.",
        "Ben: Really? Like how?",
        "Rachel: Well y'know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we'd jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they'd put salt on their cereal.",
        "Ben: (laughs) That's a good one.",
        "Rachel: Yeah? You like that one?",
        "Ben: Yeah, you're funny.",
        "Rachel: I'm funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I've got a ton of these! Umm, oh here-Do you want a good one? Here's a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? (Does so.) And then you say to person, I bet you can't roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it, they're left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.",
        "Ben: Can I do it to you?",
        "Rachel: Yeah, I-I-I-I'm funny Ben, but I'm not stupid. Okay?",

        "Monica: We're never gonna find anybody.",
        "Joey: Well then let me do it!",
        "Chandler: Joe...",
        "Joey: No-no-no! Look, I've been thinking about it. I'm an actor right? So I won't get nervous talking in front of people.",
        "Monica: Joey look it's really sweet...",
        "Joey: No-no-no-no look no! I won't spit, and I won't stare at Monica's breasts! Y'know? Everyone knows I'm an ass man!",
        "Monica: That is true.",
        "Joey: Yeah and the most important thing is that it won't be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It'll be me! And I swear I'll do a really good job. Plus, y'know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.",
        "Chandler: (To Monica) Y'know, we haven't found anybody else.",
        "Monica: It might be kinda cool.",
        "Joey: So I can do it?",
        "Chandler: Yeah you can do it.",
        "Joey: All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have s*x right?",

        "Phoebe: Oh my God, you've got to stop chattering!",
        "Monica: Here, take a couple of these. (She gets up to grab a couple of pills.)",
        "Phoebe: What is it?",
        "Monica: It's Hexadrin.",
        "Phoebe: Oh no, I don't believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply pressure to these points right here. (She's pinching the bit of skin between her right thumb and forefinger with her left hand.) Then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so thanks. (Takes the pills.)",
        "Monica: Okay, while we're waiting for these pills to kick in, I'm gonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. (Phoebe gets up and goes with her.) Get some nice soft pillows under your head, I'm gonna turn the TV on and you can watch whatever you want. And I'm-Sit down-(She sits down on the couch)-gonna make you some tea. And then, I'm gonna rub your feet.",
        "Phoebe: Oh.",
        "Joey: Oh! My head! Oh! (He's sitting on the chair, lies back, and puts his feet up for Monica to rub.) Oh!",
        "[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is reading and there is knock on the door which she answers.]",
        "Rachel: Coming.",
        "(She opens the door to reveal Ross with a pencil mark from his forehead to his chin.)",
        "Ross: I have a bone to pick with you.",
        "Rachel: Uh-oh.",
        "Ross: Yes! Ben learned a little trick.",
        "Rachel: Oh yeah? Did he pull the old... (She is waving her hand up and down her face. She's thinking about the pencil mark.)",
        "Ross: That's right! That's right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!",
        "Rachel: Oh that.",
        "Ross: Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They're mean and they're stupid and-and I don't want my son learning them!",
        "Rachel: Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don't think that's just a little funny?!",
        "Ross: I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right?",
        "Rachel: (looking at his mark) Yes.",
        "[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe, Chandler, and Monica are there.]",
        "Phoebe: It's amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called?",
        "Monica: Hexadrin. (She gets the box out of her purse.)",
        "Phoebe: Oh, I love you Hexadrin! (She kisses the box.) Oh look! It comes with a story! (She pulls out the instructions and side effects paper.)",
        "Monica: No Phoebe, those are like the side effects and stuff.",

        "Monica: Y'know, the possible side effects.",
        "Phoebe: Oh my God! (Starts reading them.) Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial swelling, nausea, headache-Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage! Now okay, I don't recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I'm sorry, extra strength death capsules!",
        "Monica: Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons!",
        "Phoebe: Why?",
        "Monica: In case it happens.",
        "Joey: (entering) Hey!",
        "Chandler: Hey!",
        "Joey: Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani! (Holds up the piece of paper bearing the proof of his ordination.)",

        "Monica: You did it! You got ordained?!",
        "Joey: Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of p0rn out there!",
        "Chandler: Our minister...",
        "Phoebe: I have liver damage. Ow! Oh! (She grabs the left side of her torso.)",
        "Monica: Phoebe, your liver is right here. (She points to the right side of her torso.)",
        "Phoebe: Okay, then I must be disoriented.",
        "Joey: Anyway, I started working on what I'm going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?",
        "Chandler: Okay.",
        "Monica: Yeah!",
        "Joey: Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so... (Starts to read the piece of paper he brought.) \"We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share.\" (Monica and Chandler like it so far.) Eh? (He continues reading.) \"It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving.\" (Phoebe nods her approval.) \"We too can share and love and have and receive.\"",

        "[Scene: Carol and Susan's, there is a knock on the door and Carol opens it to reveal Rachel.]",
        "Carol: Hey Rachel! (The camera cuts to her face and we see that Ben pulled the quarter trick with her as well.)",
        "Rachel: Hi!",
        "Carol: What a nice surprise! What are you doing here?",
        "Rachel: Well y'know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your building and I thought to myself, \"What's up with Carol and sweet, little Ben?\"",

        "Ben: (jumping up from behind her chair) Gotcha!! (Rachel jumps up startled.)",
        "Rachel: I found him! (To Ben) Very funny, come here! (She sits down on the coffee table and Ben walks up.) That is exactly why I've come here to talk to you okay?",
        "Carol: (from the kitchen) Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?",
        "Rachel: Yes oh-(To Ben)-Do I want sugar in my coffee? (Ben nods no.) No, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. (To Ben) Okay, do you remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?",
        "Ben: (mimicking her) Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?",
        "Rachel: Don't do that.",
        "Ben: Don't do that.",
        "Rachel: Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.",

        "Monica: Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!",
        "Phoebe: Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one! (Holds up the warning label.)",
        "Joey: Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?",
        "Chandler: Yeah. O-okay.",
        "Joey: (reading) \"When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and...\" And then I can't think of a good word for right here. (He points to the stop on the paper where he left off.)",
        "Monica: How about receiving?",
        "Joey: Yes!",
        "Chandler: See Joe, not that that's not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y'know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!",
        "Joey: Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?",
        "Chandler: No, not us... (Motions Joey and him.) Us! (Motions Monica and him.)",
        "Joey: I gotcha. Sorry. (To Monica) So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?",
        "Phoebe: Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?",
        "Monica: It doesn't say that!",
        "Phoebe: Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side effects!",
        "Chandler: See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y'know, romantic stories. Nice stories.",
        "Joey: Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I'll talk about London! Y'know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won't say hooked up. I'll say, \"Began their beautiful journey...\"",
        "Monica: There you go!",
        "Joey: \"...by doin' it.\"",
        "Chandler: Joe?",
        "Joey: Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing y'know you're in the bathtub together and she's feeding you strawberries?",
        "Chandler: Isn't that what happened with you and the bridesmaid?",
        "Joey: Yeah!! I call that London style.",
        "Monica: No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy thought that I was Ross's mom.",
        "Joey: Oh.",
        "Monica: And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much...",
        "Joey: Yeah baby!",
        "Chandler: And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.",
        "Joey: Oh.",
        "Chandler: But then later that night...",
        "Joey: Yeah baby!",
        "[Cut to London, Chandler's hotel room. He is getting ready for bed by doing push-ups. One push-up. Just as he gets under the covers, there's a knock on the door.]",
        "Chandler: (answering the door) Hey!",
        "Monica: (standing outside) Cute PJ's! You're really livin' it up here in London huh?",
        "Chandler: Well I was... I wasn't exactly expecting company after...(He looks at his watch.) 9:15.",
        "Monica: (entering) Is Joey here?",
        "Chandler: Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bridesmaid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you're not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?",
        "Monica: Wouldn't you be?",
        "Chandler: Well, look it's been a really emotional time y'know, and you've had a lot to drink. And you've just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!",
        "Monica: Really?",
        "Chandler: You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... (She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?",
        "Monica: Well, not anymore.",
        "Chandler: But we don't do that.",
        "Monica: I know, I just thought it would be fun.",
        "Chandler: How drunk are you?",
        "Monica: Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.",
        "Chandler: (thinks) That's the perfect amount!",
        "Monica: Okay!",
        "(They run to the bed, sit down, and start making out again.)",
        "Monica: (breaking the kiss) Y'know what's weird?",
        "Chandler: What?",
        "Monica: This doesn't feel weird!",
        "Chandler: I know.",
        "Monica: You're a really good kisser.",
        "Chandler: Well, I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you wanna get under the covers?",
        "Monica: Hm-hmm!",
        "Chandler: Okay!",
        "(They do so and they take off their clothes.)",
        "Monica: Wow! You are really fast!",
        "Chandler: It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.",
        "Monica: We're gonna see each other naked.",
        "Chandler: Yep!",
        "Monica: Do you wanna do it at the same time?",
        "Chandler: Count of three?",
        "Monica: One!",
        "Chandler: Two!",
        "Monica: Two!",
        "Monica and Chandler: Three! (They lift up the covers and check each other out, then come back up with silly grins on their faces.)",
        "Chandler: Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.",
        "Monica: Eh, we weren't that close anyway!",
        "Chandler: Eh!",
        "(They start making out again, and it takes Joey trying to enter to stop them.)",
        "Chandler: Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey! (Monica hides under the covers as Joey enters. Remember?)",
        "Joey: Hey!",
        "Chandler: Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e... (Notices that the TV is turned off.)",
        "Joey: Oh, dude I'm so sorry!",
        "Chandler: No! No! No!",
        "Joey: Hey no-no-no-no! It's cool! It's cool! I-I'll only be a second, I'm still with my bridesmaid, I just-Where are those condoms you brought?",
        "Chandler: They're in my bag over there. (Points.)",
        "Joey: Ah. (Joey walks to Chandler's bag by getting as far away from Chandler's bed as possible.)",
        "Chandler: Uh, could you leave me one?",
        "Joey: (pause) For just you?",
        "Chandler: Yeah.",
        "Joey: Hey listen, why don't you come downstairs with me? There's some really nice girls down there.",
        "Chandler: No I-I-I'm fine.",
        "Joey: All right, here you go buddy. (He tosses him one.) Go nuts. (Exits.)",
        "[Cut back to Monica and Chandler telling Phoebe and Joey the story.]",
        "Joey: That's what that was?! 'Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.",
        "Monica: Okay, can we change the topic? Because it's really doing nothing for me.",
        "Joey: Oh... (To Chandler) Can you imagine if I hadn't left you that last one? You two might've never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It's like it was in the stars!",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, it's totally meant to be. (To Monica) Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.",
        "Monica: What?!",
        "Chandler: What?",
        "Phoebe: (To Joey) What?!",
        "Chandler: Who did you originally want to hook up with?",
        "Monica: Okay, fine but please don't be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted...just s*x. So, when I...went to your room that night...I was actually looking...for Joey. (Joey smiles.)",
        "Joey: Yeah baby! (Chandler glares at him.) No baby!",

        "[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, scene continued from earlier.]",
        "Chandler: (To Monica) So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?",
