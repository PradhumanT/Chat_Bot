        "[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's apartment, Ross is cleaning out the fridge. Joey walks from his room. He looks like he just woke up.]",
        "Joey: What are you doing?",
        "Ross: I...reorganized the fridge. See, bottom shelf: meats and dairy. (There's nothing on the shelf.) Middle shelf: fruits and vegetables. (There's one lone tomato.) And top shelf: expired products. (The shelf is jammed packed.)",
        "Joey: Why are you doing this?",
        "Ross: Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I've already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.",
        "Joey: Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You've got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven't you ever been unemployed?",
        "Ross: Hey, I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!",
        "Joey: Hey, don't get religious on me, ok. (Ross looks a little confused.) A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here...sit down. (Ross sits down.) Ready? (Joey flips the foot rest up.) Ahh!! (He reclines the chair fully.) Ohh, yeah!! Huh?!",
        "Ross: So what, we just sit?",
        "Joey: Ohh, no, no. We're not going to just sit. (Joey sits down and hits the speed dial button on the phone.) Shhh. (It begins to ring.)",
        "Chandler: (Answering the phone at work) Hello, Chandler Bing.",
        "Joey: (In a high pitched female voice) Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.",
        "Chandler: (Angrily) Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! (Ross and Joey laugh silently.) It's been six months! It's not funny!",
        "Joey: But, I love you.",
        "Chandler: Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!! (Joey hangs up.)",

        "Phoebe: Ohh, you and your ways. (She shakes the bell at him and sits down.) Since it's Christmastime. I'm going to be one of those people collection donations.",
        "All: Ohh.",
        "Phoebe: (Excitedly) Yeah, I already have my bell and later on...I get my bucket.",
        "Chandler: Ohh.",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, yeah, I'm going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year, I'm going to do the whole city.",
        "Monica: You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular. (Chandler laughs.)",
        "Joey: So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?",
        "Phoebe: Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah, they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I'm the only one who can sing \"Merry Christmas\" in 25 languages. (She smirks.) I lied.",
        "Rachel: Oh my god. Ok you guys, there's Danny. Watch. Just watch this. (He walks past the couch to the counter.) See?! Still pretending he's not interested. Ohh, he's coming over. Just pretend like we don't know him. We've forgotten who he is.",
        "Danny: Hey guys.",
        "All: Hey Danny.",
        "Monica: Danny? You know Rachel? She's nice. She's not bad to look at, right?",

        "Monica: Friday's perfect...She can't wait.",
        "Danny: (To Monica) On the date, I will be able to talk to her directly? (To Rachel) See ya Friday. (He walks out.)",

        "Joey: She's a woman!",
        "Estelle: What can I say? She nailed it.",

        "(Monica puts some change in Phoebe's bucket.)",
        "Phoebe: Is that a new Swede jacket? It looks really expensive.",
        "Monica: Yeah. I guess. (She puts more money in the bucket.)",
        "Phoebe: Just get your nails done?",
        "Monica: Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have. Okay? (She pours out the rest of her change purse into the bucket.)",
        "Phoebe: Okay! Thanks! Happy Holidays, here's your joy. (She waves her arm and spreads her joy.)",

        "Phoebe: Thank you! And Happy Holidays.",
        "(The man starts to take some change out.)",
        "Phoebe: Wait, you can't take the money out.",
        "The Man: I'm making change. I need change for the bus.",
        "Phoebe: But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor.",
        "The Man: I'm poor! I gotta take the bus!",
        "Phoebe: Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still...",
        "The Man: Bite me, blondie! (The man storms off.)",
        "Phoebe: Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just... (She scowls at him.)",
        "[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Joey is telling Ross how he didn't get the part.]",
        "Joey: That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!",
        "Ross: I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?",
        "Joey: Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?",
        "(Ross just stares at him until he figures it out.)",
        "Joey: Wait a second, I could star in it!",
        "Ross: Or that.",
        "Joey: I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it.",
        "Ross: I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.",
        "Joey: Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!",
        "Ross: Yeah!",
        "Joey: Thanks!",
        "Ross: (grabbing a notepad and sitting down) All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.",
        "Joey: Done!",
        "Ross: And it can't be Joey.",

        "Rachel: I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.",
        "Monica: Oh, honey, I'm sorry.",
        "Rachel: Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!",
        "Monica: You had no relationship!!",
        "Rachel: No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!",
        "Monica: Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.",
        "Rachel: She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.",
        "(Rachel goes into her room and closes the door. Which allows Monica to let Chandler out of her room.)",
        "Monica: Come on, hurry!",
        "(Chandler runs out the door and closes it behind him. After a short pause the door opens and Chandler comes rushing back through, grabs Monica, kisses her good-bye, and heads back out.)",
        "[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Joey is trying to write his movie, Chandler is playing a game on the counter by trying to flip a ping pong ball with a spoon into a nearby bowl.]",
        "Joey: Hey, how do you spell suspicious?",
        "Chandler: Why?",
        "Joey: Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.",
        "(Chandler makes it into the bowl.)",
        "Chandler: Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.",
        "Joey: You're driving me crazy with that!",
        "Chandler: Okay, I'll stop.",
        "Joey: Don't stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!",
        "(Chandler slides the bowl to the far end of the counter. He tries again, but he hits the spoon to hard and the ball goes flying away.)",
        "Joey: Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.",
        "Chandler: You wanna play?",
        "Joey: Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.",
        "Chandler: Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.",
        "Joey: (jumping up) All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?",
        "Chandler: I'm intrigued.",
        "Joey: All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.",
        "Chandler: Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.",
        "Joey: Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.",
        "Chandler: Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?",
        "Joey: Uh yeah, right here. (He punches his fist through the wall next to the door.)",

        "(Another woman walks up and throws something into the bucket.)",
        "Phoebe: Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't... (The lady ignores her and walks off.) Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!",
        "(Another guy walks by and throws his light cigarette butt in the bucket.)",
        "Phoebe: Hey!! (The bucket starts smoking.) The charity's on fire! Help! (Yet another guy walks by carrying a cup, which Phoebe grabs.) Oh good! Thank you, I need that. (She throws onto the smoldering fire. Suddenly the bucket erupts in flames.) Whoa! What is that?! (She sniffs the cup.) (To the guy.) It's nine o'clock in the morning!",
        "[Scene: Chandler, Joey, and Ross's, Ross is reading what Joey wrote.]",
        "Ross: All right. (Reading.) A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. (Stops reading a flips the page to find the next one is blank.) That's it? (Joey shrugs.) Joey, you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident! (Flipping through the rest of the pad.) And what is, and what is all this?! (Reading.) The official rulebook of Fireball.",
        "Joey: Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.",
        "Chandler: (entering from his room carrying a fire extinguisher and wearing oven mitts) Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid-Op! Op! (He puts out a small fire which has re-ignited in his room.)",
        "Ross: This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!",
        "Joey: You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work.",
        "Ross: (To Chandler) And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work. (To Joey) Now come on!",
        "Joey: Hey!",
        "(He tries to fire a burnt tennis ball into the bowl Chandler is standing by, but Ross grabs the ball away from him.)",
        "Ross: No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done! (After Joey walks past, Ross throws the ball down in pain.) Ahh! (Chandler shows him the burn spots on his oven mitts.)",

        "Rachel: You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? (Danny nods, \"Yes.\") Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch!",
        "Danny's Sister: (opening the door) Oh, I thought I heard you.",

        "Monica: No.",

        "Monica: Oh, you're kidding.",
        "Rachel: Yeah, they were very y'know...wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?",
        "Monica: (laughing with Ross) We don't, we don't wrestle now.",

        "Joey: Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.",
        "Chandler: The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.",
        "Ross: I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!",
        "Joey: Come on look guys, don't fight.",
        "Ross: And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.",
        "Chandler: Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?",
        "Ross: If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.",

        "Krista: Oh, this is so good (A piece of cake.) you have got to try it. (She takes some on her finger and feeds it to Danny. Then takes a little more and does it again. Meanwhile, the rest of the gang stares on in shock. Then they pick up a part of it and some filling falls into his lap.)",
        "Danny: Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.",
        "Krista: Here, I'll get it. (She grabs a napkin and tries to wipe it up. The thing that gets the rest of the gang going is that she's whipping awfully close to his crotch. In fact, she is whipping his crotch. Chandler's about to come out of his chair.)",
