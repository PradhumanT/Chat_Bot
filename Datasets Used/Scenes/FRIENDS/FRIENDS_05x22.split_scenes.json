    "Recap": [
        "Joey lands a role in an independent movie, then borrows Phoebe's taxicab to drive to the Las Vegas location. Chandler rides along, but learns that Joey will not get paid unless the movie is successful. He remarks that he does not think the movie will be Joey's big break. Furious, Joey kicks Chandler out, stranding him on the bridge . Chandler later phones Joey and apologizes, though Joey does not tell Chandler that he was right. Production has been shut down due to lack of funds forcing Joey to get a job at Caesars Palace as a gladiator. Meanwhile, Rachel has an eye infection but resists using the prescribed eye drops; Phoebe is angry at Ross and refuses to make up, leaving it to Ross to figure out what he did, only to discover Phoebe dreamed it."

        "[Scene: Central Perk, everyone but Phoebe are there reading. Rachel is sitting on the couch flanked by Ross and Monica. She suddenly stops reading and starts blinking her left eye as if it's bothering her. The problem is that Joey is on her left and thinks she's winking at him and winks back. Ross is watching this and isn't quite sure of what to make of it.]",
        "Ross: What's going on?",
        "Rachel: Well, my eye is a little itchy.",

        "Chandler: Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!",
        "Monica: Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!",

        "Rachel: (flinches) Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weird thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?",
        "All: All right, fine.",
        "Monica: Hey Rach, remember that great song, Me, Myself, and I? (And on the \"I\" part she mimics poking her eye.)",

        "Joey: (entering, depressed) Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what. (Pause, then very excitedly) I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!",
        "Chandler: You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!",
        "Joey: It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears... But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, \"Where's Betsy?\" Right? And she says, \"Betsy's been dead for 10 years.\"",
        "Phoebe: Ohh-oh, chilling!",
        "Joey: And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! (To Chandler) And you know what that means buddy!",
        "Chandler: Yeah, I know that means buddy!",
        "Joey: Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!",
        "Phoebe: Oh wait, my grandmother's dead.",
        "Chandler: Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.",
        "Phoebe: No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas.",
        "Joey: All right! Thanks Pheebs!",
        "Chandler: Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?",
        "Joey: Oh umm, not go.",

        "Rachel: (entering from her bedroom) All right! Let's get this over with! Ugh! (She walks by the table and notices that no one is looking and accidentally on purpose knocks over the open cereal box.) Ohhh! No! Look what I did! (She starts walking through the mess. {Also, notice the continuity error in this scene. Note the position of the box and dispersal pattern of the cereal before and after the camera cut.}) Oh, I mean, look at this mess! I mean, we're probably gonna have to clean this up! Y'know? We're gonna have to reschedule!",
        "Monica: No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! All right, let's go Blinky! (She ushers Rachel out the door, but before the door fully closes she sticks her head back in.) Chandler!!!! (Chandler agrees to clean up the mess.)",
        "[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is reading a map as Phoebe enters.]",
        "Phoebe: Oh hey Joey! What's up?",
        "Joey: I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, I've been around.",
        "Joey: Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?",
        "Phoebe: Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. {Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}",
        "Joey: Great! Problem solved!",
        "Phoebe: But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.",
        "Joey: Well, back to square one.",
        "Phoebe: Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.",
        "Joey: (quickly) Yes!",
        "Phoebe: Good, but wait. Okay, all right, here we go. Now I want you to relax. Take a deep breath. Clear your mind. (Quickly) Which do you like better peanut butter or egg whites?",
        "Joey: Peanut butter!",
        "Phoebe: Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?",
        "Joey: A swimmer!",
        "Phoebe: Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?",
        "Joey: Monica. Oh... huh, I always thought it would be Rachel.",
        "Phoebe: No thinking! No thinking! Tie or ascot?",
        "Joey: Ascot!",
        "Phoebe: North route or south route?",
        "Joey: North route!",
        "Phoebe: Bamn! There you go! Huh?",
        "Joey: Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come!",
        "Ross: (entering) Hey!",
        "Phoebe: Oh, this guy again. (She ignores him.)",
        "Joey: Hey man, what's up?",
        "Ross: Uhh, not much. You guys want to see a movie tonight?",
        "Joey: Sure, what do you want to see?",
        "Ross: I don't know, umm...",
        "Joey: Oh, I know how we can decide. Phoebe, show him your game!",
        "Phoebe: Umm, no thank you. (She gets up and moves to the couch. They were at a table previously.)",
        "Ross: What's with her?",
        "Joey: I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick. Okay?",
        "Ross: Okay.",

        "Ross: Action.",
        "Joey: Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?",
        "(Ross pauses and looks at him, Joey motions for him to hurry up.)",
        "Ross: Dude, you are sick.",
        "Joey: Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.",
        "[Scene: Monica's eye doctor's office, Monica and Rachel are waiting in an exam room and looking at this big white thing used to check eyes. I have no idea what it is, and if an ophthalmologist happens to know what that is, let me know.]",
        "Rachel: Oh my God! What does that thing do?",
        "Monica: (looks at it more closely) Oh that's an eye removal machine.",
        "Rachel: All right, I'm outta here!",
        "Monica: I'm kidding! I'm kidding!",
        "(Rachel heads for the door but is intercepted by the doctor.)",
        "The Doctor: Hi Rachel!",
        "Rachel: Hey!",
        "The Doctor: I'm Dr. Miller. Monica told me you were a little nervous, but don't worry everything's gonna be just fine.",
        "Rachel: So were done then!",
        "Dr. Miller: Almost! But first, we gotta start.",
        "Rachel: Okay.",
        "Dr. Miller: This is a glaucoma test.",
        "Rachel: Uh-huh.",
        "Dr. Miller: Sit down.",
        "Rachel: Okay.",
        "Dr. Miller: Put your chin here. (She does so.) Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.",
        "Rachel: (jerks back from the tester) What?!",
        "Monica: A small puff of air, now come on!",
        "Dr. Miller: Here we go.",
        "Rachel: All right.",
        "Dr. Miller: 1...2...3! (Rachel jerks back on 3.)",
        "Rachel: I'm sorry. All right, I'll just stay in here this time. (Puts her head back.) Okay.",
        "Dr. Miller: Ready?",
        "Rachel: Uh-huh.",
        "Dr. Miller: 1...2... (She flinches on 2 this time.)",
        "Monica: Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head.",
        "Rachel: Okay.",
        "Dr. Miller: That's okay.",
        "Monica: Okay. (Monica backs off.)",
        "Rachel: Okay. Okay!",
        "Dr. Miller: 1...2! (She flinches again.) (Gives up.) Y'know what? You're young; you probably don't have glaucoma.",
        "Rachel: (really excited) Great!! It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow! Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy! (He took out that thing they use to look at people's retinas and looked at Rachel's when she was shaking his hand causing her to flinch and scream at him.)",
        "Dr. Miller: Okay. You've got a small, minor infection in that left eye. I want you to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new.",
        "Rachel: Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.",
        "Dr. Miller: Okay then, I guess we'll see you back here in three months.",
        "Rachel: Great!",
        "Dr. Miller: And I'll fit you for a glass eye.",
        "Rachel: Okay, just give me the damn drops! (Grabs them and storms out.)",
        "Monica: Dr. Miller? (She covers her right eye and reads from the chart) P E C F D.",
        "Dr. Miller: Very good Monica! You know where they are.",
        "Monica: I sure do! (She runs over to a drawer, opens it, and grabs a lollipop.) (To Rachel) And you don't get one!",
        "[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe, Rachel, Monica, and Joey are there.]",
        "Rachel: Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better.",
        "Monica: They're still in my coat.",
        "Rachel: Damn!",
        "Chandler: (entering) Hey!",
        "Joey: Hey! You ready to go?",
        "Chandler: Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough? (Holds up 3 of them in different colors.)",
        "(Monica stares at him.)",
        "Chandler: What?",
        "Monica: I love you.",
        "{There's another continuity error here. Before Monica says I love you, Chandler's holding the vests so that you couldn't see the collar, you could see all three, and they were folding nicely. After she says the line and the camera cuts back to Chandler, you can only see two out of the three, you can see the collar of the top one, and it looks like it was folded sloppily, unlike before. Hey, you notice things while spending this much time on this!}",
        "Joey: Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!",
        "Phoebe: Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!",
        "Chandler: Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?",
        "Joey: Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.",
        "Chandler: I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?",
        "Joey: Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.",
        "Chandler: So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?",
        "Joey: Did you not hear the plot of the movie? \"She's been dead for ten years.\" I'm gonna be a millionaire!",
        "Ross: (entering) Hey!",
        "Joey: Hey!",
        "Ross: I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.",
        "Joey: You got it!",
        "Ross: All right!",
        "(Joey nods to Chandler, no way!)",

        "Rachel: Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the puss.",
        "(Pause.)",
        "Joey: See ya! (Walks out.)",
        "Rachel: Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing! (Runs after him.)",
        "Ross: Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading? (Phoebe ignores him) Pheebs? (Turns away) Hello? (He sits down next to her and she moves over a bit.) Phoebe? (He moves closer and she keeps moving away.) Phoe-Phoebe! (They end up hanging over the arm rest.) Come on! (He grabs the magazine away from her.)",
        "Phoebe: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.",
        "Ross: Phoebe, are you, are you mad at me, or something? 'Cause if are please, tell me what it is I did!",
        "Phoebe: Well, if you don't know I can't help you.",
        "Ross: Well, I don't know.",
        "Phoebe: Well, I can't help you.",
        "Ross: Well, whatever it is I'm-I'm very, very sorry. Okay?",
        "Phoebe: Apology accepted.",

        "Phoebe: (quietly) Bye, fat ass.",
        "Ross: ALL RIGHT!! Phoebe now come on! Will you please tell me what it is I did that mad you so mad at me!",
        "Phoebe: I don't know! I don't remember!",
        "Ross: Well if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?",
        "Phoebe: Oh no, I am mad at you. I know that much. But, I am sorry about the fat ass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney.",

        "Chandler: We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once.",
        "Joey: Don't worry, it's out there! (Just then a horn honks and Joey quickly looks at the road.) I think I just need lunch.",
        "Chandler: Yeah.",
        "Joey: You wanna eat? (Pulls out the twenty) My treat!",
        "Chandler: Isn't that Ross's money?",

        "Phoebe: What's in the bag?",
        "Chandler: Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road. (Looks into the bag.) Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?",
