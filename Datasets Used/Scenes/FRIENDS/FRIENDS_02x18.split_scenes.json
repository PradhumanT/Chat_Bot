        "PHOEBE: Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?",
        "JOEY: Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'",
        "PHOEBE: Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?",
        "JOEY: Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?",

        "[Rachel's bedroom]",
        "RACHEL: Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.",
        "ROSS: Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?",

        "ROSS: Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini.",
        "RACHEL: Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.",
        "ROSS: Really?",
        "RACHEL: Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal s*x. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head.",
        "[Scene: Chandler and Eddie's apartment.]",
        "CHANDLER: Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.",
        "EDDIE: That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.",
        "CHANDLER: This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.",
        "EDDIE: Where's Buddy?",
        "CHANDLER: Buddy?",
        "EDDIE: My fish, Buddy.",
        "CHANDLER: There was no fish when she dropped it off.",
        "EDDIE: Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy?",
        "CHANDLER: Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie...[puts his hand on Eddie's shoulder] Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon? [picks up the fruit an tosses it to Eddie, it hits Eddie in the chest and falls]",
        "[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica and Richard are in Monica's bedroom.]",

        "RICHARD: Right, and...",
        "MONICA: And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?",
        "RICHARD: Honey, you are not an oat. I, I mean I don't know, I, I guess I'm just not an oat guy. I've only slept with women I've been in love with.",
        "MONICA: But you've only slept with two people.",
        "RICHARD: Right.",
        "MONICA: Wow. Oh wow. You know I love you too, right.",

        "[Ross and Rachel are in Rachel's bedroom]",
        "RACHEL: Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.",
        "ROSS: Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.",
        "RACHEL: God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...",
        "ROSS: Animal s*x, animal s*x? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk s*x?",
        "RACHEL: Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo.",
        "ROSS: Knock-knock.",
        "RACHEL: But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect. Ya know, I swear, this is the best I have ever had.",

        "CHANDLER: It's gonna be ok. You know that?",
        "JOEY: No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.",
