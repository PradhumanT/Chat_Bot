    "Recap": [
        "When Monica rushes Ross to the emergency room after he suffers an allergic reaction, Chandler and Joey babysit Ross' baby son, Ben. They use him as bait to attract girls, but women think they are a gay couple. After accidentally leaving Ben on a bus, they are unable to identify which of two babies is Ben at the city's lost & found. Phoebe loses her Central Perk gig to a professional performer ( Chrissie Hynde ), so she defiantly sings outside the caf\u00e9. Also, a stranger Giovanni Ribisi , who accidentally dropped a condom in Phoebe's guitar case, rushes back to reclaim it for an \"emergency.\" Catherine Bell appears as Robin, one of the girls in the bus."

        "RACHEL: But what about Phoebe?",
        "TERRY: Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.",

        "(Chandler and Joey are loaded down with baby stuff, and Ben)",
        "CHANDLER: You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?",
        "JOEY: It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.",

        "RACHEL: Honey, I'm sorry.",
        "PHOEBE: And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.",
        "RACHEL: Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying \"Terry's a jerk!\" That's where that came from.",
        "PHOEBE: Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could.",
        "RACHEL: Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do. All right, look, look. Why don't you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever-her-name-is. I mean, you won't even be here. You don't pay her. It's not gonna cost you anything.< br>",

        "RACHEL: Well, but Pheebs.",
        "PHOEBE: No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play. (Out on the sidewalk, singing) When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity. (Someone puts a coin in her guitar case) Thank you! La la la la la la la....",
        "ROSS: Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.",
        "DOCTOR: Hello, there. I'm Dr. Carlin. I see someone's having an allergic reaction.",
        "MONICA: Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.",
        "ROSS: Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?",
        "MONICA: My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.",
        "DOCTOR: No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.",
        "ROSS: Tho?",
        "(Monica shakes her head.)",
        "ROSS: Ohhh.",
        "MONICA: That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?",
        "ROSS: Ok.",
        "MONICA: Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!",
        "CHANDLER: That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!",

        "BOTH: Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait!",
        "MONICA: Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts.",
        "DOCTOR: No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here is the puncture wound from your ring.",

        "CHANDLER: (on pay phone) Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.",
        "JOEY: Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again.",
        "RACHEL: Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to--",

        "CHANDLER: Please tell me you know which one is our baby.",
        "JOEY: Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.",
        "CHANDLER: Ok.",

        "RACHEL: Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well.",
        "PHOEBE: Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better.",
        "RACHEL: Do you?",
        "PHOEBE: No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang \"Su-Su-Suicide\", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, \"Smelly Cat\", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat.",
        "RACHEL: Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!",
        "PHOEBE: It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money.",
        "RACHEL: Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for \"Smelly Cat\".",
        "PHOEBE: Really? From who?",
        "RACHEL: Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.",
        "KID: Hi. Uh, did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It's kind of an emergency.",
        "PHOEBE: Yeah. Here you go.",
        "KID: Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it!",
        "(chez Monica and Rachel)",
        "ROSS: I just wanna thank you for being there for me today. And I'm sorry I,I almost broke your hand.",
        "MONICA: That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.",
        "ROSS: Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand?",
        "MONICA: Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle?",
        "ROSS: Oh.",
        "MONICA: Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?",
        "ROSS: Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb?",
        "MONICA: No. But I remember people telling me about it.",
        "ROSS: I hope Ben has a little sister.",
        "MONICA: Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.",
        "ROSS: I'm gonna get a new band-aid. Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken?",
        "MONICA: That was you?",
        "ROSS: They, uh, were infected. He wouldn't have made it.",
        "MONICA: Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. Hey, he's not crying.",

        "JOEY: Yes! There's still pie.",
        "ROSS: I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?",
        "JOEY: Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today.",
        "ROSS: Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus--Hey, I have a question. How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt?",
        "CHANDLER: You, you are gonna love this.",
        "ROSS: Will you hold Ben for a sec? Come here. Come here.",
        "CHANDLER: Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!",
        "STEPHANIE: (singing) Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?",
        "PHOEBE: No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's \"smelly cat, smel-ly cat\".",
