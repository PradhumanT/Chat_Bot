Monica makes one dozen lasagnas for her aunt's party, only to discover she wanted them vegetarian. Ross consoles Rachel after her break-up, hoping this is his chance, though Rachel declares she is swearing off all men. Rachel accidentally lets it slip to Ross that he is having a son."

        "Monica: Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. (pauses, listens to person on phone) Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.",
        "(Camera moves to Chandler, Phoebe, Ross, and Joey sitting in living room)",
        "Joey: Ross, did you really read all these baby books?",
        "Ross: Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that! (snaps fingers)",
        "Phoebe: Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta. (Joey grimaces)",
        "Chandler: And, we're done with the yogurt. (Sets yogurt down on table)",
        "Phoebe: (softly) Sorry. (Camera pans back to Monica, still on phone)",
        "Monica: Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? (listens to Aunt Syl on phone, looks shocked) Nice talk, Aunt Syl. (in New York accent) You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?",
        "(Camera pans back to group in living room)",
        "Joey: Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? (measures about 2 inches with his thumb and index finger) This is your baby. (in baby-like voice) Hi Daddy!",
        "Ross: (waves) Hello!",
        "Joey: (in baby-like voice) How come you don't live with Mommy? (pause; shows Ross less than amused) How come Mommy lives with that other lady? (pause; Ross still looks less than amused; Joey smiling) What's a lesbian? (playfully hits Ross)",
        "(Rachel enters with Paolo, speaking Italian. Ross looks annoyed)",

        "Ross: Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be...(makes flinging motions with hands) flung by now?",
        "(Camera pans back to Rachel)",
        "Rachel: I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally...",
        "(Camera pans to Ross, holding his stomach)",
        "Ross: ...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? (pauses, looks suddenly inspired) I could call immigration!",

        "Carol: Don't you want to know about the s*x?",

        "Carol: Do you want to know?",
        "Ross: No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is! (pauses) Or isn't...",

        "Chandler: Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?",
        "Joey: That's the rule.",
        "Chandler: What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!",
        "Joey: How'd you get to that?",
        "Chandler: Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio",
        "Joey: You knew about that?",
        "Chandler: Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.",
        "Joey: Ok, ok, How about if we split it?",
        "Chandler: What do you mean, like, buy it together?",
        "Joey: Yeah",
        "Chandler: You think we're ready for something like that?",
        "Joey: Why not?",
        "Chandler: Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?",
        "Joey: Why, are you moving out?",
        "Chandler: I'm not moving out.",
        "Joey: You'd tell me if you were moving out right",
        "Chandler: Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...",
        "Joey: Aw, I know all about Kip!",
        "Chandler: It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.",
        "Joey: Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?",

        "Monica: And Monica knows...",
        "Ross: Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!",
        "Monica: Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.",
        "Joey: So what's it gonna be? (Monica whispers in Joey's ear. Ross gets up and waves arms frantically in protest)",
        "Ross: Wait-oh-hey-huh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!",

        "Chandler: Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.",
        "Joey: Feminist issue. That's where I went!",
        "Phoebe: She is gonna hate me.",
        "Ross:(sympathetic yet...) Yeah, well...",
