    "Recap": [
        "In Vegas, Ross and Rachel initially have no memory of getting married the previous night, then must deal with the aftermath of their drunken escapade. Phoebe and Joey drive back to New York in Phoebe's cab. She becomes angry when Joey sleeps most of the way rather than playing his promised fun road trip games; she unnerves Joey by picking up a hitchhiker while he was napping. Back at home, Monica and Chandler ponder the idea of marriage and decide to take their relationship forward a step by living together. Opening Credit Gag: Courteney Cox married David Arquette between seasons 5 and 6 and she changed her last name to Cox-Arquette. As a tribute to them, Courteney Cox-Arquette was given top billing for the episode, and \"-Arquette\" was added to every cast member's last name in the opening credits."

        "Monica: This is insane!",
        "Phoebe: What's the big deal, y'know? It's not like it's a real marriage.",
        "Chandler: What?!",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you're only married in Vegas.",

        "{Transciber's note: In case you haven't heard, Courteney Cox got married to David Arquette during hiatus and changed her name to Courteney Cox Arquette. But David was a busy boy during the off season for not only did he marry but everyone else as well. For they're all listed as Jennifer Aniston Arquette, Lisa Kudrow Arquette, in an interesting twist Matt LeBlanc Arquette, Matthew Perry Arquette, David Schwimmer Arquette, and even the creators of the show are now David Crane Arquette and Marta Kauffman Arquette. I just wonder what the new sleeping arrangements are...}",
        "[Scene: Rachel's hotel room, she's waking up with a horrendous hangover.]",
        "Rachel: Ohhh! (Looks in the mirror and sees that she still has her mustache and groans.)",
        "(Suddenly, there's movement beside her, startling her. It's Ross! He wakes up and they both start screaming in terror. Then they both grab their heads having aggravated their hangovers.)",
        "Ross: Why are we in bed together?",
        "Rachel: I don't know. Do-do you have any clothes on?",
        "Ross: (checks) Yeah.",
        "Rachel: Really?!",
        "Ross: No! But we-we didn't have...sex-uh, did we? I mean, I don't remember much about last night, it was such a blur.",
        "Rachel: Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.",
        "Ross: And we didn't have s*x.",
        "(Rachel agrees with him and starts to get out of bed.)",
        "Rachel: Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I'm just glad we didn't do anything stupid.",
        "Ross: (getting up) Tell me about it. (He sits up on the edge of the bed and has \"Just Married\" written on his back.)",

        "Phoebe: Oh Joey, I'm so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?",
        "Joey: Nah, I'm too depressed to eat. I'll probably eat in like 5 minutes. So I guess I'll just fly home with you guys, what time's your flight?",
        "Phoebe: What about my cab?",
        "Joey: I don't need that anymore.",
        "Phoebe: No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.",
        "Joey: I don't want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely. (Gets an idea.) Oh-ooh! How about you come with me?",
        "Phoebe: I don't know, it's such a long trip.",
        "Joey: It'll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be our chance to like renew our friendship.",
        "Phoebe: Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?",
        "Joey: Sure?",

        "Chandler: Listen, I gotta talk to you.",
        "Joey: Sure! What's up? (He grabs a plate and proceeds to load it with a huge pile of scrambled eggs. Chandler just stares at him and Joey reluctantly gives him a spoonful.)",
        "Chandler: Monica and I almost got married last night.",
        "Joey: Oh my God! That's huge! (Hugs him.) Wait a minute, why come I wasn't invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don't say, \"Ross.\" Do not say, \"Ross.\"",
        "Chandler: Look, I just don't think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y'know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y'know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?",
        "Joey: Oh! Tell her she's not marriage material.",
        "Chandler: What?!",
        "Joey: Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she's anything like me, she's just gonna be relieved.",
        "[Pan to Monica and Phoebe having the same conversation.]",
        "Monica: How do I tell Chandler that it's too soon. It's gonna break his heart, he's not gonna think that I don't love him anymore.",
        "Phoebe: Well you don't.",
        "Monica: Yes I do!",
        "Phoebe: Good! Good! I was just testing you.",
        "Chandler: (returning with Joey) Hi.",
        "Monica: Oh hi! Hi! Y'know, we were just talking about bacon.",
        "Phoebe: No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable.",

        "Ross: Hey!",
        "The Girls: Hey!",
        "Chandler: Hey!",
        "(They both sit down and Rachel pours them both some coffee. They're acting like nothing's happened and everyone is just staring at them.)",
        "Ross: What?",
        "Chandler: Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or...",
        "Rachel: (To Ross) I don't know. (To the gang.) What do you mean last night? Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.",
        "Ross: Yeah!",
        "Phoebe: Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.",
        "(Rachel turns to Ross stunned.)",
        "Monica: Rach! We weren't gonna miss our friends getting married!",
        "Rachel: (gasps) Who got married?! (Ross is as surprised to hear this as she is.)",
        "Chandler: (not quite sure) You did.",
        "Ross: What?! Hello! We didn't get married.",
        "Rachel: No, we didn't get married! That's ridiculous!",
        "(They turn to look at each other and suddenly remember that they did in fact get married.)",
        "Ross: We-we-we-I remember being in a chapel.",
        "Rachel: Oh my God.",
        "Ross: I-They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!",
        "Rachel: No!",
        "Joey: They let you get married when you're drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!",
        "Phoebe: Hell, I'm drunk right now! (They all turn and look at her.) What? I can't have a mimosa with breakfast?! I'm on vacation!",
        "Monica: What are you guys gonna do?",
        "Rachel: Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer? (Looks at Ross.)",
        "Chandler: Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one's free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one's free.",
        "Ross: Laugh it up, but the joke's on you. Because we don't need to get divorced, okay? We we're just gonna get an annulment.",
        "Joey: An annulment? Ross! I don't think surgery's the answer here.",
        "Phoebe: Oh-oh, that's your thing.",
        "Ross: What?",
        "Phoebe: You're thing. You're thing. Y'know? You're the guy who gets divorced.",
        "All: Oh yeah!",
        "Ross: No-no, that's-that's not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!",
        "Phoebe: Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you're probably gonna marry it! Then it won't work out and you're gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. (Pause) I'm so drunk.",
        "[Scene: The casino floor, Chandler and Monica are walking through it.]",
        "Monica: So, what do you think we should do?",
        "Chandler: I don't know. But I-I-I know I love you!",
        "Monica: I know I love you! (They hug.)",
        "Chandler: So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.",
        "Monica: That's a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!",
        "Chandler: Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight (motions to the craps table) then there's a definite sign that we should get married.",
        "Monica: All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don't get married.",
        "Chandler: Sounds great.",
        "Monica: Okay. (They approach the craps table.)",
        "Croupler: Coming in, we got a shooter! Money please.",
        "Monica: Ready?",
        "Chandler: Ready!",
        "Monica: (sarcastic) Come on eight.",
        "Chandler: (deadpan) Yes, yes eight.",
        "(Monica rolls the dice.)",
        "Croupler: Eight! Easy eight. (She rolls a 3 and a 5 and they're stunned.)",
        "Monica: Wow! I can't believe I actually rolled an eight.",
        "Chandler: That was so unlikely. Well, let's get married! I guess.",
        "Monica: Wait a minute. That wasn't a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.",
        "Chandler: That's right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!",
        "Monica: I wanted it so bad! (Pause) Wanna go pack?",
        "Chandler: Yeah. (They go pack.) We're doing the right thing, right?",
        "Monica: Ohh, of course we are! (They walk up to the elevators.) We left it up to fate. (Pushes the elevator button.) If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign. (The elevator door opens to a priest reading from a bible with Chandler and Monica standing side-by-side holding each other's hands.)",
        "[Scene: Phoebe's cab, Phoebe and Joey are driving back. Phoebe is driving while Joey is sleeping.]",
        "Phoebe: Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. (Joey groans.) Come on Joey! You can't win if you don't ask any (sees that he's asleep) QUESTIONS!!!",
        "Joey: (wakes up) What?!",
        "Phoebe: Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We've been on the road six hours and you've been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!",
        "Joey: All right. All right.",
        "Phoebe: Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio's broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.",
        "Joey: Really? I don't...",
        "Phoebe: Sing!!",
        "Joey: (starts singing) I wanna rock and roll all night! (Falls asleep.)",
        "[Time lapse, Phoebe is asleep, Joey's driving and having a hard time staying awake.]",
        "Joey: (to himself) Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No! (He opens his eyes and sees a hitchhiker.)",
        "[Time lapse, Phoebe is still asleep only Joey is now passed out next to her and the car's still moving. She wakes up, sees Joey, and screams.]",
        "Hitchhiker: (driving) Morning! (Phoebe screams again.)",

        "Ross: Hey!",
        "Rachel: Hey, hubby!",
        "Ross: Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing?",
        "Rachel: Uh-huh.",
        "Ross: I'm not going to do that. (Rachel glares at him.)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Rachel: Okay! So, we'll just stay married.",
        "Ross: Yes, exactly!",
        "Rachel: And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!",
        "Ross: Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I'd have to talk you into this more.",
        "Rachel: Okay, see now I'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding.",
        "Ross: I'm-I'm not kidding. Look I-I, I can't have three failed marriages. I can't. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!",
        "Rachel: What-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever?!",
        "Ross: Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It's right next to it!",
        "Rachel: Ohh, okay, I'm sorry. You're right. Y'know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you're asking of me.",
        "Ross: I'm asking you to do me a favor.",
        "{Note: Does anyone else want to smack Ross right about now? Raise your hands. Okay, put them down before you stink out the person next to you.}",
        "Rachel: You are asking me to be your wife!",

        "Chandler: I'm not getting into this again!",
        "Monica: Okay! Oh God, y'know what? It's really bad.",
        "Chandler: Well, I told you not to walk. Here. (Picks her up.) There. Okay. (He opens the door, carries her across the threshold, stops, backs out, and lets go of Monica who is only holding on by his neck.)",
        "Monica: This doesn't mean anything, does it?",
        "Chandler: No!",
        "Monica: Okay.",
        "[Scene: Phoebe's cab, she's driving, Joey's in the back seat, and the hitchhiker is riding up front with Phoebe.]",
        "Phoebe: (To Joey) How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape-(She holds her hand in front of the hitchhiker's face), a rapist or a killer or something!",
        "Joey: Don't you think I asked him that before he got in?!",
        "Phoebe: Y'know what? I'm not talking to you! You go back to sleep! (To the hitchhiker) And you, are you a rapist?!",
        "Hitchhiker: No!",

        "Rachel: (thinks about it for a second) No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married.",
        "Ross: I don't know if it's true.",
        "Rachel: Oh b-b-but it is!",
        "Ross: Oh, okay, y'know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...",
        "Rachel: Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world's worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will!",
        "Ross: All right. All right, I'll do it.",

        "Hitchhiker: All right, see ya Pheebs. (Gets out and Phoebe drives away.)",
        "Joey: Come on Pheebs! I can't take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? (Starts singing.) Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!",
        "Phoebe: Stop it! Stop it no! That's not fair! Y'know I can't resist that beautiful voice!",
        "Joey: Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn't deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.",
        "Phoebe: You can still sleep at night and stuff.",
        "Joey: Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I've got a really good one! I've been thinking about it since Kansas.",
        "Phoebe: Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?",

        "Chandler: No!",
        "Monica: All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because it's been three days and it's driving me insane!",
        "Chandler: Jeez, relax! It's not like we're mar-ah-ah!! (Runs out.)",
        "Chandler: (entering, slowly) Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?",
