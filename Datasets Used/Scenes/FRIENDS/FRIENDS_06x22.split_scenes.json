        "Paul disapproves of Ross' relationship with Elizabeth and threatens to have him fired unless they break up. Meanwhile, Paul and Rachel begin dating. Ignoring Paul's threats, Ross and Elizabeth sneak away to her family's cabin, unaware Paul and Rachel have the same plan. As a lark, the girls put their names down on a popular wedding venue's long waiting list. When the venue happens to get back to Chandler about a cancellation, he panics and promptly bolts. Monica finds him and assures him it was not a serious reservation, little realizing that Chandler is actually planning to propose."

        "Phoebe: (dejected) Hi, you guys.",
        "Chandler: Hey!",
        "Monica: Hi!",
        "Rachel: What's the matter?",
        "Phoebe: Well it's just-it's one of those situations that I just hate. Y'know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.",
        "Joey: (nodding knowingly) Now you're thinking you gotta sleep with him.",
        "Phoebe: No! No! It's just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!",
        "Chandler: I'll give up my ticket.",
        "Joey: Me too.",
        "Phoebe: Okay that's so generous!",
        "Chandler: And I think Ross is generous too.",
        "Phoebe: Great! Okay then it's just us girls!",
        "Monica and Rachel: (less than enthused) Great.",
        "Phoebe: Yeah.",
        "Rachel: So what-what is the exhibit.",
        "Phoebe: It's mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.",
        "Joey: Oh man! (Hits Chandler)",
        "Ross: (entering) Hey!",
        "Rachel: Hi!",
        "Chandler: Hey!",
        "Joey: Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!",
        "Ross: Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.",
        "Monica: Oh that's great!",
        "Ross: Yeah.",
        "Monica: I mean think about all the money that you're gonna make!",
        "Ross: Why? What?",
        "Monica: Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?",
        "Ross: No, no, that's funny. But maybe it's time to move on, let it go, y'know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth's father, so ah, he's much older than she is. Looks like I'm not the only one interested in fossils, huh?",
        "Rachel: I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.",
        "Ross: Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings (Paul enters) in his ear.",
        "(And walks up right behind Ross, and standard sitcom joke 2B follows with the person being insulted standing right behind the person doing the insulting while the rest of the people become frightened and try to warn the insulter about the insultee's presence.)",
        "Chandler: Ross.",
        "Ross: Oh, come on you guys; that's funny! Y'know? Because he's need-he's got like a hearing aide y'know, 'cause-'cause y'know, 'cause he's all old, and...",
        "(Paul reveals his presence by laughing, thus concluding standard sitcom joke 2B. Paul then pulls Ross aside to have a little chat with him and tells the rest of the group that he'll just be one second.)",
        "Paul: Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much, I've decided to accept the fact that you're going out with her.",
        "Ross: Really? That okay, that's great.",
        "Paul: Yeah. But then I changed my mind. I'm funny like that. So I told Lizzie, now I'm telling you, I don't want you seeing my daughter anymore.",
        "Ross: All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.",
        "Paul: Yes it does.",
        "Ross: But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don't think there's really anything you can do about it.",
        "Paul: I'll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired.",
        "Ross: Ohh! A man with a plan!",

        "Phoebe: Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek!",
        "Joey: I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin' up about something... Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he's just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi b*st*rd, I'll...",
        "Phoebe: (gasps) Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. (Giggles) Yeah I know; we'd be great together!",
        "(The dry cleaner finishes with the customer in front of Joey and they approach the counter.)",
        "Joey: Hey! So I'm back.",
        "The Dry Cleaner: Who are you?",
        "Joey: Joey Tribbiani! From the wall! (The dry cleaner doesn't remember) Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh? (Holds his picture up in front of his face.) Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I'm ready to go back up on the wall I'm the star of a new TV show.",
        "The Dry Cleaner: (picking up a TV Guide) Show me in the table.",
        "Joey: Oh well, it's not on TV yet.",
        "The Dry Cleaner: Well, then it's not on the wall yet.",
        "Joey: Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh? (Walks away)",
        "Phoebe: So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer's clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven't been cleaned yet?",
        "(The dry cleaner just stares at her and she retreats.)",
        "[Scene: The Morgan Chase Museum, the girls are entering.]",

        "Monica: Yeah!",
        "Phoebe: Hey, and then lunch.",
        "Rachel: Oh, wait yes, but I can't eat too much. Paul is taking me out to dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned.",
        "Phoebe: Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he's gonna tell you that he's gay?",
        "Rachel: What?! No! Why?!",
        "Phoebe: No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?",
        "(A museum official enters with another man and woman.)",
        "The Museum Official: (to the couple) You can put the aisle over here (points), and put the wedding ceremony right over here. (Points.)",
        "Rachel: I didn't know you could get married here.",
        "Monica: This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn't put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there! (Points to both places.) I mean you'd have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch. (The arch at the entrance to the room.)",
        "The Museum Official: (To Monica) May I help you?",
        "Rachel: Oh sorry didn't mean to interrupt. It's just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?",
        "The Museum Official: Yes. We're very popular. There's a two-year waiting list. Sorry! (She kinda storms out with the couple.)",
        "Rachel: Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list",
        "Monica: What?! Are you crazy?! I'm not getting married! I'm not even engaged.",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, but there's a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That's four years. Chandler's not gonna wait that long. He's gonna find somebody else, y'know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list. (Rachel agrees.)",
        "Rachel: Yeah hon, it can't hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you're not engaged you just don't use it.",
        "Monica: Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.",
        "Rachel: I'm gonna do it too!",
        "Phoebe: Me too!",
        "Rachel: Really? Who would, who would you marry?",
        "Phoebe: I don't know, I don't have anyone right now. Y'know?",
        "Rachel: Oh Pheebs.",
        "Phoebe: Don't feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn't gay.",
        "Monica: Phoebe, that stuff is...",

        "The Dry Cleaner: I did.",
        "Joey: All right, let's get me back up there! (Holds out his picture.)",
        "The Dry Cleaner: No! It don't go up on the wall!",
        "Joey: What-But you saw the show!",
        "The Dry Cleaner: Yes, it was very offensive to my people!",
        "Joey: Dry cleaners?",
        "The Dry Cleaner: Russians! It showed them as terrorists and villains!",
        "Joey: Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!",
        "The Dry Cleaner: That's right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer, he brings us a lot of clothes; you bring us nothing!",
        "Joey: Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-that's offensive to Russians.",
        "The Dry Cleaner: I've never seen it!",
        "Joey: Oh you should, it's great.",
        "(The Dry Cleaner stares at him and Joey retreats.)",

        "Ross: This place is really beautiful!",
        "Elizabeth: Yeah, I've been coming here since I was a kid. This used to be my Grandma's.",
        "Ross: Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes-Do-do you want to make out?",
        "Elizabeth: Sure!",
        "(They fall to the couch and start to make out, but Ross stops suddenly.)",
        "Elizabeth: Are you okay? What's wrong?",
        "Ross: Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father.",
        "Elizabeth: Well, whatever works for ya...",
        "Ross: No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.",
        "Elizabeth: Oh. Well, so we have to hide our relationship from one more person. Big deal. Besides, it's kinda fun hiding.",
        "Ross: Yeah.",
        "(They start making out again.)",
        "Elizabeth: (quietly) Hey umm, you brought protection right?",
        "Ross: (loudly) Why?! Are there like bears or something?! (Looks around and then sees that Elizabeth is shaking her head no and realizes what Elizabeth meant.) Ohh. Oh, protection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot.",
        "Elizabeth: I'll just run to the store and get some.",
        "Ross: Oh no! Hey-hey, I'm the guy! I'll get it.",
        "Elizabeth: Do you know where the store is?",
        "Ross: No.",
        "Elizabeth: Do you want to ride around town on my little pink bicycle?",
        "Ross: A little bit.",
        "Elizabeth: (laughs) I'll be back in ten minutes.",
        "Ross: Okay.",
        "Elizabeth: Why don't you get in the hot tub and I'll meet you there.",
        "Ross: Ohh, okay.",
        "(Elizabeth leaves and Ross starts to remove his clothing right there in the middle of the living room where someone can see him. Of course, someone almost does, but he hears a door opening and...)",
        "Rachel: (from another room) Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.",
        "(Ross with his pants around his ankles tries to run, but Dr. Geller forgets that he has his pants around his ankles and falls down trying to flee.)",
        "Paul: (To Rachel) Thank you, it's my mom's. So this is the kitchen.",
        "(Dr. Geller, the man with the Ph.D. in Paleontology, is trying to find a place to hide, but this supposedly intelligent man in the hands of clich\u00e9d scriptwriters runs around with his pants down around his ankles like one of the Three Stooges.)",
