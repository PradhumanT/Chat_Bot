    "Recap": [
        "Joey buys a big screen TV and two leather recliners with his soap opera salary, turning him and Chandler into \"coach potatoes\" who spend days watching TV and never getting out of the chairs. Monica has a catering job for handsome Dr. Richard Burke (Tom Selleck), an ophthalmologist, who is an old family friend. He and Monica are mutually smitten and later go on a date. Ross and Rachel attempt to have their first real date, though Rachel has difficulty adapting to their new romantic relationship, breaking into giggles at inappropriate times. Just before their next date, Ross has a museum emergency, so Rachel goes along. They spend the night in a museum exhibit, waking up nude and under an animal skin, to visitors gawking at them. The episode introduces Tom Selleck in a recurring guest role that led to an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series in 2000."
