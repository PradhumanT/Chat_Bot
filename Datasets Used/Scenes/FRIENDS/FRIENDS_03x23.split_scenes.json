    "Recap": [
        "Afflicted with a mysterious skin condition on his back, Ross seeks advice from Phoebe's herbalist ( Kevin McDonald ). Unable to choose between dating a hunky fireman or a smart kindergarten teacher, Phoebe attempts to date both, though neither is entirely what she believes them to be. Monica thinks Pete wants to break up after he says they \"need to talk\" when he returns from Atlanta. Monica thinks Pete is going to propose when she finds a receipt from a ring designer. To her initial relief and then shock, Pete had a professional athletic ring built to pursue his dream of being an Ultimate Fighting champion."

        "Chandler: Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.",

        "Phoebe: Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight.",
        "Rachel: What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.",
        "Phoebe: I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler.",
        "Joey: So Pheebs, do they know about each other?",

        "Joey: (going over to him) Well?!",
        "Chandler: (joining them) Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?",
        "Ross: Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign.",
        "Joey: Well what is it?!",
        "Ross: He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.",
        "Chandler: Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.",
        "Ross: At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name.",
        "Joey: Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, \"Awww, he's got a Ross.\"",
        "Ross: (sarcastic) Yeah, that'd be cool!",

        "All: What?!",
        "Monica: I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk.",
        "Rachel: And?",
        "Monica: Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad.",
        "Joey: Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you.",
        "Monica: Really?!",
        "Joey: Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you.",

        "Jason: No, no?",
        "Phoebe: Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic. (hears the sound of approaching sirens) Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out of here!",
        "Jason: W-w-w-wait! Why?!",
        "Phoebe: Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay? (she drags him away)",

        "Dr. Rhodes: Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here. (Ross starts to take off his pants) What are you doing?",

        "Dr. Rhodes: Well that's not a third nipple.",
        "Ross: No?",
        "Dr. Rhodes: First of all, it's on your ass.",
        "Ross: Well then, what is it?!",
        "Dr. Rhodes: Wait a minute, hold it. (He goes to the door and opens it.) Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?",

        "Chandler: Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.",
        "Joey: Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.",
        "Phoebe: (entering with Rachel) ...and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.",
        "Rachel: Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?",
        "Phoebe: (disgusted) Uh.",
        "Joey: Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?",
        "Phoebe: Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field.",
        "Rachel: So Pheebs, pick one of them.",
        "Monica: Yeah. Which one do you like more?",
        "Phoebe: Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's so burly, he's sooo very burly. (giggles)",
        "Joey: Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.",

        "Ross: Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don't want to make it savory.",
        "Monica: Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.",
        "Ross: Gimme this. (Grabs the herbalist's card and leaves.)",

        "Monica: It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. (Rachel slams the magazine shut in amazement.) I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't. Right? I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.",

        "Rachel: You didn't break up with that fireman?",
        "Phoebe: No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.",
        "Rachel: Wow!",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, well he'd prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.",
        "Monica: So then, are you going to dump Jason?",
        "Phoebe: Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and... Okay so Jason is sensitive, (holds up one finger) but now so's Vince (holds up one finger on her other hand) Plus, Vince has the body y'know? (holds up two more fingers on the Vince side) So...

        "Ross: What's a koondis?",
        "Guru Saj: I don't know, what's a koondis with you? (starts laughing as if that joke was funny, Ross only looks at him, and he stops) Please, lie down! I've got a sav that oughta shrink that right up.",
        "Ross: I guess it's worth a try.",
        "Guru Saj: Oh sure, we should see results-Whoa!! Clearly not the way to go!! (quickly wipes it off)",
