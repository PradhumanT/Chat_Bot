        "JOEY: All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.",
        "ALL: Wow!",
        "JOEY: Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.",
        "CHANDLER: 'Cause he was just so darn cute.",
        "JOEY: No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.",
        "ROSS: Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. (Rachel looks at him in disbelief) Or you just do it.",
        "JOEY: I did do it, I'm a professional.",
        "MONICA: Then what's the problem?",
        "JOEY: See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.",
        "PHOEBE: Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing (Chandler and Monica, give her a look that says 'think about it') Ooh.",

        "[Scene: continued from earlier]",
        "CHANDLER: Hey, what did your agent say?",
        "JOEY: Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.",
        "MONICA: What, forget it!",
        "RACHEL: Yeah, right.",
        "JOEY: Come on, I need your help here.",

        "JOEY: You see this, this is a friend.",
        "PHOEBE: Uh-huh, let's go. (they move in to kiss) Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. (they kiss rather passionately) Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend.",
        "JOEY: Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?",
        "MONICA: Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.",
        "JOEY: Yeah, that makes sense. (looks at Ross)",

        "PHOEBE: (laughing) Oh my God, you look so good!",
        "RACHEL: I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous.",
        "ROSS: So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding.",
        "RACHEL: Because I promised Mindy I would.",
        "MONICA: Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him. (Rachel glares at her, and she retreats to safety between Richard's legs)",

        "RICHARD: Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown ups to cut it out.",
        "MONICA: Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure.",
        "RICHARD: Okay.",

        "RICHARD: Like a hound?",
        "MONICA: Not a basset, a bassinet.",
        "RICHARD: You really need the bassinet?",

        "ROSS: Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis. (da-doom-chesh) (to drummer) What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me (looks for the da-doom-chesh, and doesn't get one) Cheers.",
        "RACHEL: (to Ross) She you in the parking lot.",
        "ROSS: (runs after her) No, Rach!",
        "BARRY: And once again she is out of here. Okay who had 9:45? Um?",
        "RACHEL: (after a pause with everyone staring at her, she goes up to the microphone) Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings (da-doom-chesh). See now, tonight, all I really wanted was to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity. Well (laughing), I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen. There's nothing really left to say except....(starts singing) \"Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl. With yellow feathers (band joins in), feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there. She would...\"",
