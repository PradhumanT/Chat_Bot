        "Rachel: Oh, slides. (Laughs.) So really nothing happened.",
        "Ross: Something could've happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.",
        "Rachel: Right. Was it the, \"Please don't show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?\"",
        "Ross: Anyway, if she, if she wasn't in to me, why-why would she ask me out again?",
        "Rachel: She asked-asked you out again?",
        "Ross: Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine's Day, the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what I mean.",

        "Monica: Yeah you're right. I don't know what I was thinking.",
        "Chandler: No, I guess I just never really cried. Y'know? I'm not a crying kind of guy.",
        "Joey: Come on man there's gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?",
        "Chandler: I'd be sad sure, but I wouldn't cry.",
        "Joey: Okay, what if the puppy said, \"Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me.\"",

        "Joey: (laughs) I don't think so.",
        "The Fan: No-no, it was! She was in s*x Toy Story 2, Lawrence of Alabia, and I got her autograph! The guys at the comic book store aren't gonna believe this! (Exits.)",
        "Joey: Hey Gunther, don't let that guy in here anymore! He just said Phoebe's a p0rn star!",

        "Jill: You'll never believe what just happened, Ross just totally blew me off and he didn't even tell me why!",
        "Rachel: Ohhh well. Y'know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He's a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.",
        "Jill: Y'know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I'm not gonna date some random guy from your work.",
        "Rachel: It's not random, it's Bob.",
        "Jill: It's probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe he doesn't like the way I dress-No that can't be it. It's really gotta be the smart thing. Oh I'm so stupid! I'm just like this incredibly pretty stupid girl!",
        "Rachel: No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.",
        "Jill: You asked him too?!",
        "Rachel: Hm-mmm.",
        "Jill: Why?!",
        "Rachel: Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history...",
        "Jill: I don't understand, do you want to go out with Ross?",
        "Rachel: No.",
        "Jill: You don't want him, but you don't want me to have him?",
        "Rachel: (changing the subject) Y'know Bob in Human Resources...",
        "Jill: Ugh! I cannot believe you did this too me! You had me doubting how smart I was! (Gasps) You had me doubting my fashion sense!",
        "Rachel: Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don't date Ross! There's a million other guys out there, you just...",
        "Jill: Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do.",
        "Rachel: I'm not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!",
        "Jill: Why are you so jealous of me?",
        "Rachel: Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can't have!",
        "Jill: Can't have?! Excuse me, the only thing I can't have is dairy! (Starts to storm out.)",
        "Rachel: All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!",

        "Ross: And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn't know he was in there. (They all kinda look at him.)",
        "Rachel: Wow! I mean, I just-I can't, I can't believe this. Y'know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who's always been somewhat of a question mark.",
        "Monica: This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y'know she had such a terrible childhood.",
        "Chandler: Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don't do p0rn.",
        "Monica: Yes, but you are dead inside.",
        "Joey: All right well, I'd better take that back.",
        "Monica: Wh-what, why?",
        "Joey: We can't watch that! I mean that's Phoebe!",
        "Monica: Yeah you're right, we can't-we shouldn't watch this.",
        "Rachel: Absolutely not.",
        "Monica: (hands the tape back to Joey, but doesn't let him grab it) Y'know maybe a little bit!",
        "Rachel: Probably just the first half.",
        "Joey: No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe's our friend! Well, I'm not gonna watch it!",
        "Ross: Yeah! Good for you Joe!",

        "The Vampire: Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?",
        "Buffay, the Vampire Layer: Actually, I was kinda hoping it would be the other way around.",
        "(At this point, Buffay, the Vampire Layer and Nasforatool start to get it on. Of course, since this is network TV, we can only see the reactions of the gang to the film playing off screen.)",
        "Monica: Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?",
        "Chandler: Her ankle is what you're watching?",
        "Rachel: Well it's hard to tell... (Rachel gets up to get a closer look, only she's having some trouble.) Oh God, if she would just stop moving.",
        "Chandler: She's just doing her job!",
        "Joey: (sitting at the kitchen table with his back to the TV) You sick bastards!",

        "Monica: (picking up the book) Chicken Soup for the Soul?",
        "Chandler: There's no back to this couch!",
        "Monica: Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.",
        "Chandler: Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y'know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn't think I was y'know, all dead inside.",
        "Monica: Oh that's so sweet! Look Chandler I don't care if you can't cry, I love you.",
        "Chandler: Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.",

        "Monica: I won't care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here. (Points to her heart.)",
        "Chandler: Yeah?",
        "Monica: Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don't cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won't matter to me.",
        "Chandler: Okay, well I won't uh, worry about this anymore then.",
        "Monica: And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you're writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, \"I will always be with you,\" and you still can't shed one tiny tear, I know you'll be crying a river inside.",

Umm, that-that's just a little game I play with the kids down the hall. Umm, they've really taken a liking to me. (Quickly looks out to see if they're watching.) Uhh what's-what's-what's the matter?",
        "Jill: Rachel and I had a really big fight, can I come in? I-I mean I know we're not supposed to see each other anymore and I'm okay with that, it's just that I don't know anybody in the city and I really need somebody to talk to about it.",
