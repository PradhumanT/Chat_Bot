        "[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Phoebe, Ross, Joey, and Rachel are there, Joey is demonstrating a card trick.]",
        "Joey: Okay, pick a card, any card. (Monica picks one) All right, now memorize it. Show to everybody. Got it?",
        "Monica: Um-mm.",
        "Joey: All right, give it back to me. (takes the card back, but he looks at the card before he puts it back in the deck, he holds the deck to his forehead, and thinks a little while) 5 of hearts.",
        "(Monica is sarcastically amazed.)",
        "Ross: Real magic does exist.",
        "Rachel: Wow.",
        "Monica: Wow. Joey, (sarcastically) how do you do it?",
        "Joey: I can't tell you that, no.",
        "(We hear some knocking coming from the ceiling.)",
        "Ross: Ah, somebody's at the door on the ceiling.",
        "Rachel: Noo, that's our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.",
        "Monica: He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.",
        "Phoebe: Why don't you go up there and ask him to 'step lightly, please?'",
        "Monica: I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.",
        "Phoebe: Ooh, that is silly. (gets up) I'll go up there, I'll tell him to keep it down.",
        "Monica: All right, be my guest.",
        "Rachel: Good luck.",
        "(Phoebe exits)",
        "Joey: All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I'll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. (picks up a card and quickly looks at it) I just did it. (does it again) I just did it, again. Here, I'll slow it down so that you guys can see it. (looks and the card in slow motion)",
        "All: Oh, I got it.",
        "(We hear Phoebe knock at the door upstairs, and the guy answer it.)",
        "Phoebe: (muffled through the floor) Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... (I tired but the rest is unintelligible).",
        "Guy: (muffled) Whoa, you are very beautiful.",
        "Phoebe: (muffled) Oh, thank you.",

        "Chandler: (entering) Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?",

        "Chandler: I just saw Janice.",
        "All: Oh.",
        "Chandler: Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.",
        "Joey: Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.",
        "Chandler: Yes, but you ended up having s*x with both of them that afternoon.",
        "Joey: Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....",
        "Ross: Hey Chandler, there's a party tomorrow, you'll feel better then.",

        "Monica: It's Joey's birthday.",
        "Chandler: Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.",
        "(We hear Phoebe's muffled voice through the ceiling.)",
        "Monica: Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.",

        "Mr. Kaplan: I'm not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.",
        "Rachel: I know!",
        "Mr. Kaplan: I'll bet your thinking, 'What's an intelligent girl who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee?' Eh?",
        "Rachel: Op.",
        "Mr. Kaplan: Eh.",
        "Rachel: Oh, you got me.",
        "Mr. Kaplan: Well, don't think I haven't noticed your potential. Well, I've got a project for you that's a lot more related to fashion. How does that sound?",
        "Rachel: Oh, that sounds great.",
        "Mr. Kaplan: Come on over here, sweetheart. (they walk over to a storage closet)",
        "Rachel: Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.",

        "Monica: I know honey, I'm sorry.",
        "Rachel: Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in.",
        "Monica: (gives her a look) Gee, I don't know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!",
        "Rachel: Oh honey, come on, I'm sorry, I didn't.... I don't mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.",
        "(A guy at the end of the table starts laughing.)",
        "Rachel: (to him) Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?",
        "Guy: I'm sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah.... (starts to laugh again)",
        "Rachel: It's not funny, this is actually my job.",
        "Guy: Oh believe me, I-I-I've been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.",
        "Rachel: Oh well then, so I'm just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.",

        "Phoebe: Well, he's very charming.",
        "Monica: I know, he's too charming, but if you two start going out, then it's just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.",
        "Phoebe: Well, you're just gonna have to try.",
        "Monica: Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?",
        "Joey: I don't know, Chandler is supposed to be passin' 'em around...",

        "Rachel: What!?",
        "Ross: Well, I'm just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.",
        "Rachel: To be nice.",
        "Ross: Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?",
        "Joey: No, only for s*x.",
        "Ross: Thank you. (to Rachel) So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me?",
        "Rachel: I didn't have to, because I was wearing my 'I heart Ross' sandwich board and ringing my bell.",

        "Joey's Sisters: Oh!!",
        "Chandler: No-no-no-no, no, it's a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can't we savor the precious moments? (to one of Joey's sisters) Those are some huge breasts you have.",

        "[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Phoebe, Ross, and Rachel are eating breakfast.]",
        "Ross: (to Rachel) So, he's just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn't want anything in exchange for helping him?",

        "Phoebe: We didn't fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!",

        "Ross: Mary-Angela.",
        "Joey: Yeah.",
        "Monica: Y'know which one was she again?",
        "Joey: Why don't you ask Chandler, 'cause he's the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin' over Janice by groping my sister.",
        "Chandler: It's gotta be the first one.",

        "Ross: Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How's it going. This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write. (to Chandler) What the hell's a matter with you? How do you think Joey's going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?",
        "Chandler: Well, that's the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I'll be in Cuba.",
        "Ross: All right, look, look, you've got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.",

        "Chandler: I'm here to see Mary-Angela.",
        "Joey: You are so the man! (motions him to come in, and he does) Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, 'cause my Grandma doesn't know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.",
        "Chandler: Where's Mary-Angela?",
        "Joey: She's right in there. (motions to the living room)",

        "Monica: Wait a minute, why don't you just call Mark. (they both look up in shock) I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you've got to make stuff happen.",
        "Ross: But, you, you don't want to seem too pushy.",
        "Monica: (to Ross) Honey, it's not pushy, he gave her his home number.",
        "Ross: (to Rachel, as she gets his number) What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home?",

        "Rachel: (on phone) Hello, Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Green. (listens) Oh no, don't you apologize. (listens) Yeah, I'll hold. (to Monica and Ross) He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.",
        "Ross: That is so made up!",
        "Rachel: (on phone) Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it's perfect. Oh God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! (hangs up phone) I got the interview!",

        "Monica: What?",
        "Ross: 'Why don't you call him?!' Well, thank you very much! Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!",
        "Monica: Are you crazy?!",
        "Ross: Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.",
        "Monica: What?! Ross y'know this isn't even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you're right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?",

        "Chandler: Look, I may have jumped the gun here. (she tries to kiss him, but he ducks it and moves away) Um, I just got out of a relationship and I'm not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.",

        "Chandler: (pats him on the shoulder) You're it! Now run and hide!",
        "Mary-Theresa: It's no big deal. Chandler was just kissin' me because he thought I was Mary-Angela.",
        "Joey: What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?",
        "Chandler: I wasn't sure which one Mary-Angela was. (all of Joey's sisters gasp) Look, I'm sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.",
        "Joey's Sister: I say, punch him Joey.",
        "All: Yeah! Punch him!!",
