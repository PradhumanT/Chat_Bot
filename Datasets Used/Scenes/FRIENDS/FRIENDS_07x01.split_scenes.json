        "Chandler: So when you said, \"Get up early,\" did you mean 1986?",
        "Joey: You guys don't think I look 19?",

        "Monica: Yeah, but I don't think we have time.",

He's got the wool cap, he's got the cut-off Knicks jersey over the faded T-shirt, and he's got the whole pants-around-the-knees-showing-off-the-boxers thing that rich, white, suburban kids have adopted in a desperate and extremely futile attempt to try to look like they're from the inner-city.]",

        "Monica: (interrupting) Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?",
        "Rachel: What?",
        "Monica: See, I've been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I'm only planning on doing this once. So, uh y'know, maybe this is selfish and I'm sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.",
        "Rachel: Oh honey, but it is just about...",
        "Ross: It is! It is!",

        "Ross: Look let's not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn't even matter!",
        "(Chandler and Joey enter and overhear that.)",
        "Joey: Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!",
        "Chandler: (angrily) I don't think that's what they were talking about Joe!!",
        "Phoebe: What a great night, Chandler can't do it, these guys kissed... (Points to Ross and Rachel.)",

        "Ross: Oh no!",
        "Rachel: No-no, it's really not huge.",
        "Ross: And; people thinking it's huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder. (To Monica) Which we are not!",

        "Chandler: Yes, you can pass for 19.",
        "Joey: Really?",
        "Chandler: Yes!",

        "Joey: Yeah! Well, I think we'll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, \"You look 19,\" and then they just take it away like-like, \"No you don't.\"",
        "Phoebe: Well, I don't think Monica is gonna take this away.",
        "Joey: Wouldn't she?",
        "Phoebe: Would she?",

        "Ross: Hey, I just realized we kinda left some stuff up in the air...",

        "Monica: Paris?",
        "Chandler: We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la (mumbles something).",
        "Monica: Keep talking.",
        "Chandler: Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it's romantic, but because I can!",

        "Phoebe: Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you... You gotta do something about your eyes.",
        "Joey: What?! What's wrong with my eyes.",
        "Phoebe: They give you away! There's just-there's just too much wisdom in there. (Joey nods in agreement.) Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.",
        "Joey: And that'll get rid of my wisdom?",
        "Phoebe: Maybe just 10 minutes for you.",
        "[Cut back to Monica and Chandler's room, they are making out again as there's another knock on the door.]",

        "Rachel: (ignoring them) Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?",
        "Monica: I don't know! I don't-maybe you're feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you'd get married first! Maybe you can't stand the fact that your formerly fat friend is getting married before you!",
