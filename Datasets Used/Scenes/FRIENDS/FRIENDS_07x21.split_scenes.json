        "[Cut back to the girls.]",
        "Monica: Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!",
        "Phoebe: Well maybe you don't talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about, y'know, all the things that he's taught you. Like... (They all try to think about one example and don't succeed.) Or all the things you taught him.",

        "Monica: Why won't I be married when I'm 40?",
        "Chandler: Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.",

(Pause) I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. (Starting to cry again.) And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you marry me?",

        "Joey: Okay.",
        "(Joey leaves and Monica comes up for air.)",
        "Chandler: Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.",

        "Chandler: Hey Joe!",
        "(Monica goes back underwater as Joey re-enters.)",

        "Chandler: It happened in London.",
        "Joey: IN LONDON!!!",
        "Chandler: The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.",
        "Joey: But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!",
        "(They both grab him and stop him.)",
        "Chandler: No-no-no-no-no! You can't!",
        "Monica: Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.",
        "(Joey thinks it over.)",
        "Joey: All right! Man, this is unbelievable!",
        "[Cut to Rachel listening to a phone conversation between Chandler and Monica in The One With All the Resolutions.]",
