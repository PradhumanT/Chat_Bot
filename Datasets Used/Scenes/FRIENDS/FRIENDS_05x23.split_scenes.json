        "Monica has lunch with Richard but does not tell Chandler. The gang goes to Las Vegas to visit Joey. Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe find him working at Caesar's Palace while his movie is shut down. Ross sees Rachel naked through his apartment window, mistaking it as an invitation to \"the physical act of love\". On the plane to Vegas, Ross and Rachel needle each other; he draws a mustache on her with a marker pen while she is asleep. In Vegas, Ross and Rachel get drunk. Joey discovers his \"identical hand twin\" that he believes is a money-making opportunity to fund his movie. Phoebe feuds with a slots \"lurker\" and gets ejected from the casino, though she returns as \"Regina Phalange\". Chandler and Monica decide to get married. At the wedding chapel, Ross and Rachel drunkenly stumble out of the chapel ahead of them."

        "Monica: Really?",
        "Phoebe: But again, Simmons. Go on.",
        "Monica: The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!",
        "Phoebe: Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?",
        "Monica: Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.",

        "Chandler: Do we have to?",
        "Monica: No.",
        "Chandler: Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.",

        "Ross: Is that supposed to be an insult?",
        "Chandler: I don't know, I'm very tired.",
        "Ross: So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.",
        "Rachel: That sounds great.",

        "Phoebe: Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.",
        "Rachel: No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.",
        "Phoebe: Naked alone time.",
        "Rachel: No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn't mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.",
        "Phoebe: Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?",
        "[Scene: An airplane cabin, Phoebe has the aisle seat, Chandler the window, and Monica's stuck in that horrible middle seat.]",
        "Phoebe: So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?",
        "Chandler: So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.",
        "Phoebe: Okay, what about after I give you these candies? (Hands them each one from her purse.)",
        "Chandler: Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.",
        "Phoebe: Ah-ha! Okay, (takes out a notepad) Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back. (Gets up and heads aft.)",

        "Monica: Okay!",
        "Chandler: Okay! (He grabs his carryon and starts rummaging through it.) Oh man! Don't tell me I did this!",
        "Monica: I love the \"I forgot the present\" fake out!",
        "Chandler: How do you feel about the, \"I really did forgot the present, please forgive me\" not fake out?",
        "Monica: Oh that's okay. Don't worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.",
        "Chandler: Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!",
        "Phoebe: (sitting down) Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.",
        "Chandler: What-what Richard thing?",
        "Phoebe: Oh no. [The patented version.]",
        "Chandler: What Richard thing?",
        "Phoebe: (To Monica under her breath) Simmons! Go with Simmons!",
        "Monica: Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.",
        "Chandler: (talking out of the side of his mouth) I'm not mad.",
        "Monica: Really?!",
        "Chandler: Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal. (He still ain't happy.)",

As she bends over to grab a bottle of wine, her robe falls open (Damn this network primetime programming, we didn't see anything!) and she quickly closes it again. But then realizes she didn't have to do that. So she closes the fridge and stands next to the table, thinks about it for a little while and...]",
        "Rachel: (takes off her robe) Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.} (In her head.) Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchen...naked! I'm picking up an orange. (Does so) I'm naked! (Goes into the living room) Lighting the candles, naked, and carefully. (She backs anything that might have a point like a candle on her body away.)",

Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes-Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?",
        "[Cut back to Monica and Rachel's apartment, Rachel is singing along with a song and dancing while facing the big picture window. Y'know, I think I'd pay real good money to be on the other side of that window!]",
        "Rachel: (singing) Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow! (There's a knock on the door, she turns off the music, puts on her robe, and goes to answer the door.) Love to love ya, baby! (There's another knock.) Darnit! (Looks through the peephole and turns on the lights.) Ugh. (She opens the door to Ross who's leaning against the door jam.)",

This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of \"Us.\" (Rachel's confused) Okay? I just want this to be (Kicks off his left shoe) about what it is! (Kicks off the other one.)",

        "[Scene: Las Vegas, we have the typical glamour shots of Vegas, the Strip, slot machines, a couple other gaming tables all set to the tune of you guessed it, Money. Anyhoo, we finally get through that and watch Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe enter Caesar's Palace carrying their luggage.]",
        "Phoebe: Hey you guys wait! Guys! (Catches up to them.) This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh!",
        "Monica: Phoebe, you don't eat animals.",
        "Phoebe: For 99 cents, I'd eat you. (Sees the casino) Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! (Points to Joey in his gladiator suit posing for a picture with two old ladies.) Oh! Look! Hi!",

        "Joey: Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. (To no one in particular) Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break.",
        "Monica: Who are you talking too?",
        "Joey: They uh director. Uhh, her. (Points to an old woman standing behind him. Who glares at him and walks off.) All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.",
        "Chandler: Why?! What happened?!",
        "Joey: Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.",
