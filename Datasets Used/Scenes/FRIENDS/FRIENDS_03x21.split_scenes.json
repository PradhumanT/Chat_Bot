I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. (She removes her fake breasts) But Pete's just doing this because he has a crush on me.",
        "Rachel: And you're still not attracted to him at all?",
        "Monica: Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can't. I couldn't even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.",
        "Rachel: Yeah, but Mon that's totally different. He was you're health teacher.",

        "Chandler: Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.",
        "Phoebe: Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot's and lot's of love.",
        "Joey: Oh, well no problem there. (He picks up the chick, hugs it really tight, and talks to it like it's a little baby.)",

        "Monica: I can't do it. I'm sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me....",
        "Pete: Wait, wait, wait, wait, that's-that's what you're worried about? If that's the problem, we've got no problem.",
        "Monica: Huh?",
        "Pete: No! Look, I was gonna tell you this over dinner, but I met somebody else. On my trip.",
        "Monica: Oh?",
        "Pete: Her name's Ann, she's a journalist. Ahh, we met on the plane. She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had a big laugh. Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting.",

        "Pete: I guess you can.",
        "Monica: Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! (she rolls over and kisses him on the cheek) All right, y'know what? I'm just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!",
        "Pete: All right.",
        "Monica: Okay. (she gets ready to go) Can you give me a little push?",
        "Pete: Yeah, sure. Good luck!",
        "Monica: (rolling towards the office) I'm quitting!! Woo-hoo! (She rolls through a doorway and out of sight. We then hear a big crash, and see Monica roll past the door the other way.) I'm okay!! I'm all right!!",
        "Phoebe: (to Pete) Wow! That's exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.",
        "Pete: What?",
        "Phoebe: I'm just saying, this woman, I mean she's fictitious. No?",
        "Pete: Why would you say that?",
        "Phoebe: 'Cause you're still into Monica. So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so 'cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...",

        "Chandler: She?",
        "Joey: Well yeah, don't-don't you think it's a she?",
        "Chandler: I don't know. (He picks the chick up and turns it over, trying to determine the s*x of the chick, and blows on it.) I can't tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.",
        "Joey: Well, anyway, I got to go change, I'm ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.",
        "Chandler: Excuse me?",
        "Joey: What?",
        "Chandler: I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!",
        "Joey: Hey! Who was up from 2 o'clock this morning until 5 o'clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?",
        "Chandler: You don't think I get up when you get up?",
        "Joey: Ohhh, here it comes.",
        "Chandler: Yes, here it comes! I'm stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don't think so mister!",
        "Joey: Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!",
        "Chandler: And you don't think taking care of our chick is work?",
        "Joey: That's not what I said. Okay, I just meant...",
        "Chandler: I know what you meant!! (pause) You notice that ever since we got this chick, we've been fighting a lot more than we used too?",
        "Joey: I don't know, maybe we weren't ready to have a chick.",
        "Chandler: I'll take her back tomorrow.",
        "Joey: Do you think we'll get our three bucks back?",
        "Ross: (entering carrying a garment bag) Hey!",
        "Chandler: Hey!",
        "Ross: (sees the chick) Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think? (takes out two suits) This blue suit, or this brown one?",
        "Joey: Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the blue one.",
        "Ross: Really? (Joey gives him a 'Like I would know' look)",
        "[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is trying to take some aspirin.]",

        "Rachel: Yes I am!",
        "Ross: Rach!",
        "Rachel: Look, I'm fine. Watch. (She picks up an aspirin between her toes) Look at that. (She lifts her leg to grab the aspirin with her hand and almost falls over.) Whoa-whoa!",
        "Ross: (stopping her from falling) Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a doctor! Okay?",
        "Rachel: No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It's a very big deal, there's a lot of people there I have to meet.",
        "Ross: And I'm sure you're gonna make a big impression. Hi! I'm Rachel Green. It's nice to meet you. (He lifts his leg and imitates shaking hands with it, just like how Rachel was trying to pick up the aspirin with her feet.) Come on, you probably have a broken rib!",
        "Rachel: Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it'll still be broken then.",
        "Ross: Rach...",
        "Rachel: But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready.",

        "Ross: Ohh. (He drops the shoes, takes the brush from her, and licks the tip. He doesn't like how it tastes.)",
        "Rachel: (taking the brush back) Okay. Let's use this brush. (Hands him another one.)",

        "Ross: No. No, y'know you don't, you don't wear enough of this. (Rachel is shocked) What?",
        "Rachel: Since when, since when do you think I don't wear enough of this?",
        "Ross: Well I, close your eyes, I just think you're gonna like this a little better, 'cause, close-close... (He gets some more on the brush)",
