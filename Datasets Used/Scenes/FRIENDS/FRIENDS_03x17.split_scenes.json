    "Recap": [
        "Ross and Rachel have grown to hate each other, which divides the other friends' time between the estranged couple. Everyone minus Ross heads off for a weekend ski-trip. When the car runs out of gas on the highway, they are forced to call Ross, angering Rachel. When Ross arrives, Rachel mocks him, leading Ross to say that Monica and Joey agree with him that they were on a break, and that she is being petty. That leads to everyone fighting and Chandler smoking again. Phoebe implores them to be civil with one another, otherwise the group will disintegrate."

        "Joey: Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.",
        "Phoebe: Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He's the one who slept with someone else.",
        "Joey: Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.",
        "Phoebe: Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means.

        "Ross: Oh, now you want a favour?",
        "Phoebe: Yes, please.",
        "Ross: Well, oh, I'm sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I'm a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?",
        "Carol: (running over and grabbing the phone away from Ross) (on phone) Phoebe, hang on a second. (Hands Ross her keys) Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.",
        "Ross: No, I'm not gonna pick them up.",
        "Carol: Listen, we both know you're gonna do it 'cause you're not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.",
        "Ross: No, Rachel doesn't want me to....",
        "Carol: Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you 'cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don't punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.",
