        "Monica: Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.",
        "Chandler: I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.",

        "Phoebe: Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?",
        "Ross: Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the \"I get to see my wife,\" part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this. (He takes a big swig of Pepto Bismol.)",
        "Monica: Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?",

        "Monica: Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?",
        "Joey: (holding a box) Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.",
        "Monica: Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles...",
        "Phoebe: Ooh, Madlibs, mine! (Grabs it.)",
        "Chandler: Condoms?",
        "Joey: You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.",
        "Chandler: And condoms are the way to do that?",

        "Monica: No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. (He glares at her.) Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?",
        "Chandler: Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed! (He grabs their bags and sprints out.)",
        "[Scene: Central Perk, Ross is trying to tell Rachel about Emily's ultimatum again.]",
        "Ross: Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?",
        "Rachel: Oh yeah! (Turns to face him.)",
        "Ross: Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. Well, there's this one thing... Okay, (Rachel has her back turned to the camera, and Ross isn't looking at her.) here goes. I made a promise that-(they cut to the other camera and Ross notices something coming out of Rachel's nose)-Oh hey!",

        "Ross: You're nose is bleeding!",
        "Rachel: Oh God. (He hands her some tissues.) No! Oh not again! (Wiping her nose.) This-this happened when my grandfather died. It's ugh! Sorry. (She puts her head back.) Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?",

        "Monica: We're switching rooms again.",
        "Chandler: What? Why?",
        "Monica: This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.",
        "Hotel Clerk: Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.",
        "Monica: (To Chandler) Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?",

        "Chandler: I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch-(realizes)-have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.",
        "[Time lapse, Monica and Chandler have changed rooms yet again.]",
        "Monica: Okay, this one I like!",
        "Chandler: (watching TV, in fact, ER is on.) Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!",
        "Monica: Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?",
        "Chandler: Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?",
        "Monica: Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!",
        "Chandler: Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?",
        "Monica: I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!",

        "Rachel: Okay, what's up?",
        "Ross: Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?",
        "Rachel: Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.",
        "Ross: And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants...",

        "Ross: ...is for me not to see you anymore.",
        "Rachel: That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? (Pause) (Realizes) Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?",
        "Ross: It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.",
        "Rachel: Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!",
        "Ross: You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.",
        "Rachel: Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.",
