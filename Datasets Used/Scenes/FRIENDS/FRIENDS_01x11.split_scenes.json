        "Monica: Phoebe, what are you doing?",
        "Phoebe: Maybe nobody's tried this.",
        "Monica: I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.",
        "Monica: Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!",
        "Phoebe: Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.",

        "Chandler: Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'",
        "Ross: C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.",
        "Chandler: You can say that because she's not your mom.",

        "(Rachel feeds something to Paolo. He eats it and licks her hand)",
        "Rachel: Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.",
        "Mrs. Bing: Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.",

        "Ross: You're good.",
        "Mrs. Bing: Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why?",
        "Ross: The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?",
        "Mrs. Bing: No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off.",
        "Ross: When?",
        "Mrs. Bing: He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is.",

        "Ross: Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell... (Joey shakes his head) Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?",

        "Ross: Okay.",
        "Joey: In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!",
        "Ross: What code?",

        "Joey: You don't think my mom's sexy?",
        "Ross: Well... not in the same way...",
        "Joey: I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?",
