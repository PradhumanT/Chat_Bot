        "Joey: Yeah! Oh my God! (to Chandler) Is this what it's like to be you?",
        "Monica: Wow, you're really crazy about her, huh?",
        "Joey: Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we're on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart!",
        "Phoebe: Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this!",
        "Ross: (entering) Hey!",
        "All: Hey!",
        "Ross: Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.",
        "Monica: Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!",
        "Ross: We were all pretty shaken up about it.",
        "Phoebe: Wait, am I missing something though? 'Cause I thought death was something that's supposed to be sad, in a way.",
        "Ross: Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.",
        "Monica: Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! (Ross gives her a look) (to Ross) And I'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?",
        "Ross: You get the dollhouse.",
        "Monica: I get the dollhouse!",
        "Phoebe: Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.",

        "Phoebe: No, just a barrel.",
        "Monica: Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.",
        "Phoebe: Really?! Really?!",
        "Monica: Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.",

        "Rachel: No!! No! He's not married, or involved, with anyone!",
        "Joanna: Oh, Rachel, (pause) actually, y'know what, forget it.",
        "Rachel: Well, I'll ask him for you, if you want me too?",
        "Joanna: Would you? Or, is it just to sad and desperate, and y'know something that Sophie would do?",

        "Monica: What's this?",
        "Phoebe: That's a dog, every house should have a dog.",
        "Monica: Not one that can pee on the roof.",
        "Phoebe: Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.",
        "Chandler: (holding a tissue) And is this in case the house sneezes?",
        "Phoebe: No, no, that's the ghost for the attic.",
        "Monica: I don't want a ghost.",
        "Phoebe: Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.",
        "Ross: Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.",
        "Phoebe: Okay, obviously you don't know much about the U.S. government.",

        "Rachel: (looks at him) That was (pause) surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?",
        "Chandler: Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I'll do it.",
        "Rachel: Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she's gonna love me.",
        "Phoebe: (holding a dinosaur) Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh! (the dinosaur starts attacking the house. She starts to bark like a dog.) Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!",
        "Monica: Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that's it, that's it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They're not the right size, they're not Victorian, and they just don't go.",
        "Phoebe: Okay, (starts to pack up her stuff) fine. Come dinosaur, we're not welcome in the house of no imagination.",
        "Ross: Uh, Pheebs, while we're hovering around the subject. I just have to say dinosaurs, they-they don't go, rrroof!",

        "Lauren: Absolutely!",
        "Joey: Yeah?",
        "Lauren: Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft.",
        "Joey: They gave me the shaft all right.",
        "Lauren: (laughing) Oh, you're so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?",
        "Joey: Well Ahh, (he sees Kate and the director kissing) yeah! Yeah, sure, a drink sounds great.",

        "Phoebe: Oh, okay, it's the slide instead of stairs. Watch this. (She slides a doll down the slide)",
        "Monica: It's very interesting, Phoebe.",
        "Rachel: What's this?",
        "Phoebe: The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.",

        "Joey: (to Kate) That guy's like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?",
        "Kate: He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater you're dating.",
        "Joey: Hey, I'm not interested in her sweater! It's what's underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I'm going out with?",
        "Kate: I don't care. Why, do you want me to care?",

        "Kate: Well umm, maybe if it had more heat.",
        "Joey: How do you mean?",
        "Kate: Well, Adrian's looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor can't just kiss her, he's gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?",
        "Joey: Maybe he could slip her the tongue.",
        "Kate: Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up.",
        "Joey: Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.",
        "Kate: And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach!",
        "Joey: And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!",
        "Kate: And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal....",
        "[cut to Joey's bedroom, Joey and Kate are emerging from under the covers.]",

        "Monica: Oh my.",
        "Joey: Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming 'cause, 'cause her eyes keep going like this. (He closes his eyes and moves them around, kinda like he's been processed by the devil, or something.)",
        "Chandler: (entering with Rachel) I'm telling ya, Joanna's got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, 'This was fun. Let's do it again sometime. I'll give you a call.'",

        "Chandler: That's what you say at the end of a date.",
        "Rachel: You can't just say, 'Nice to meet you, good night?'",
        "Chandler: To her face? Look it's the end of the date, I'm standing there, I know all she's waiting for is for me to say 'I'll call her' and it's just y'know, comes out. I can't help it, it's a compulsion.",
        "Monica: Come on Rach, when a guy says he's going to call, it doesn't mean he's going to call. Hasn't it ever happened to you?",

        "Sophie: Maybe he's intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.",
        "Joanna: Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why?",
        "Rachel: Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.",
        "Joanna: Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?",
        "Rachel: Well...",
        "Joanna: The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn't tell him not to call me, did you?",

        "Rachel: Come on, this isn't funny. She thinks it's my fault that you haven't called her. You have to call her!",
        "Chandler: Look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say, 'In case you didn't notice, I don't like you!'",
        "Rachel: Well then you're going to have to take her out again.",
        "Chandler: Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!",
        "Rachel: I don't care! I don't care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it's actually ended. And, I don't care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!",
        "Chandler: All right! Fine! But it's just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don't want you setting me up with anybody ever again!",

        "[He tries to blow it out, and obviously, it doesn't work. He runs over to the sink to get a glass of water to put out the fire, but since Monica is in the shower the water pressure is very low and takes a long time to fill the glass. In desperation he takes the half full glass over and dumps it on the fire, it doesn't work. He then picks up the dollhouse and considers bringing it over to the sink, but decides to take it into the bathroom and use the shower to put it out. He kicks open the door and we hear Monica scream at the top of her lungs.]",
