        "(Robin interrupts her again by complaining loudly to Billy as the camera cuts to them.)",
        "Robin: Why? Why?! What's wrong with me?!",
        "Billy: What's the matter?",

        "Robin: Well y'know, he's got access.",
        "Billy: Yeah.",
        "Robin: Y'know it's that feeling you get, y'know?",
        "Billy: Like when you go bowling and you know you're in somebody else's shoes?",

        "Robin: (starting to cry) Ooh, (to Rachel) Can I have a napkin, please? Could you please hand me a napkin? (Rachel tries to grab one, but is to slow for his tastes.) Would you--Give me this thing (grabs the napkin holder from her.) all right!! Enough! (to Billy) And you are no longer my friend! We are finished! (gets up to leave) Nada!! No more! You are a b*st*rd for doing this!! (Billy follows him) Get away from me!!",

        "Monica: Yeah, but without the costumes.",
        "Phoebe: (disappointed) Oh.",
        "Joey: And it's not fake, it's totally brutal.",
        "Chandler: Yeah, it's two guys in a ring, and the rules are: \"They're are no rules.\"",
        "Monica: So you can like, bite, and pull people's hair and stuff?",
        "Ross: Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.",
        "Monica: What's fish hooking?",
        "Ross: Huh, what's fish hooking... (Joey sticks his finger in Ross's mouth and pulls on his cheek, y'know like when you hook a fish.) (to Joey, sarcastic) Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?",
        "Joey: What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.",
        "[Scene: Chandler's office, he is just finishing a meeting with his boss.]",
        "Doug: So thanks for the warm welcome. It's good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, let's go out there and get 'em! Huh? And remember, there is no 'I' in team.",
        "Chandler: Yes, but there's two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.",
        "Doug: (to Chandler) You! Chuckles! What's your name?",
        "Chandler: Oh it's Bing, sir. I'm sorry , I was just ah...",
        "Doug: No-no, I heard what you said, funny. I like funny. (Chandler starts to leave) This team is about hard work, but it's also about having fun. Good to have you aboard Bing! (smacks him on the butt, and Chandler leaves shocked.)",
        "[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross is making reservations.]",

        "Ross: (stunned) Dude, what are you doing?",
        "Chandler: Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.",
        "Phoebe: Yeesh, what'd you do about it?",
        "Chandler: Well, I didn't do anything. I didn't want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.",
        "Monica: I gotta tell ya, I think it's okay to be that guy.",
        "Joey: Yeah, maybe it's like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns. (pats Ross on the butt)",
        "(Ross throws his hands out in a \"What are you doing?\" gesture)",
        "Rachel: Y'know I don't, I don't understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin' her boob.",
        "Chandler: Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between 'em.",
        "Monica: Okay, can we please go eat?",
        "Joey: Yeah. What are we getting?",
        "Monica: (to Chandler) Anything but stew.",
        "Ross: All right so, Chandler, from now on, don't give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don't turn your back to him.",
        "Joey: Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. (thinking aloud) Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?",
        "Chandler: (to Ross and Monica) What if Joey were president?",
        "(Monica, Ross, Chandler, and Joey exit.)",
        "Phoebe: Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?",
        "Rachel: Yeah.",
        "Phoebe: Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?",
        "Rachel: Oh, ah with who?",
        "Phoebe: Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren't together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you're not cool with it...",
        "Rachel: Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?",
        "Phoebe: You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She's yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald...",
        "Rachel: Oh! (laughs) That's fine.",
        "Phoebe: Great! Okay, good for you! (as they leave she slaps Rachel on the butt)",

        "Hoshi: You are iron. You are steel! Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?",
        "Pete: I told you, we're adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?",
        "Hoshi: It's just hard when I know I have e-mail I can't get!",
        "Monica: (entering) Hi!",
        "Pete: Monica! (runs over and kisses her) Hi honey.",
        "Hoshi: All right, on the table. (Pete gets on the table for his rubdown)",
        "Monica: Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don't want you to get hurt, 'cause I kinda like you.",
        "Pete: Oh, believe me, I don't want to get hurt either. I'm being smart about this. See these guys? They're the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin. (Hoshi yells at him in Chinese) A house painter! He used to be a house painter.",
        "Monica: Promise me you'll be careful.",
        "Pete: I promise.",
        "Monica: Hey, are we still on for tonight?",
        "Pete: Yeah.",
        "Monica: Okay, good, 'cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own...",
        "Hoshi: No! No boom-boom before big fight!",
        "Monica: How 'bout just a boom?",

        "Rachel: (to Phoebe) Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?",
        "Phoebe: Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie. (who has hair by the way)",
        "Bonnie: Hi!",
        "Rachel: This is Bonnie? (to Phoebe) This is Bonnie? (to Bonnie) You're Bonnie?",
        "Bonnie: I can show you an ID if you want?",
        "Rachel: Oh no, I'm sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.",
        "Bonnie: Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again.",
        "Rachel: Oh, that must be it.",
        "Phoebe: (to Bonnie) Well I hope you have fun tonight.",
        "Bonnie: Thanks! You too.",

        "[cut to outside of Central Perk]",
        "Rachel: (to Phoebe) You said she was bald.",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, she was bald, she's not now.",
        "Rachel: How could you not tell me that she has hair?",
        "Phoebe: I don't know, I hardly ever say that about people.",
        "Rachel: (looks in the window) Ohh, well, this is just perfect!",
        "Phoebe: Well I'm sorry, I thought you said it was okay.",
        "Rachel: Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!",
        "Phoebe: Well, maybe it won't work out. Maybe Ross won't like her personality.",
        "Rachel: Why, does she have a bad personality?",
        "Phoebe: Oh no, Bonnie's the best!",
        "[Scene: Chandler's office, Chandler is bent over getting some water as his boss approaches.]",
        "Doug: Bing! (Chandler stands bolt upright and turns around to face him.) Read your Computech proposal, a real homerun. (He goes to slap his butt, but Chandler slides over making him miss.) Ooh. Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on. (Chandler goes over) Wham! (slaps him on the butt) Good one. That was a good one. (to a couple of Chandler's co-workers) Keep at it team. (goes into his office)",
        "Chandler: (to his co-workers) What is with him?",
        "Phil: With him? You're is favourite, you're his guy!",
        "Stevens: We never get smacked.",
        "Chandler: Well, that's not true, he-he smacked you once.",
        "Phil: Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me.",
        "Stevens: I'm telling you, I need some smacks. I got a kid starting Dartmouth in the fall.",
        "Doug: (coming out of his office) Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth sucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing?",
        "Chandler: No sir.",

        "Monica: God Ross, what is that?",
        "Ross: Yeah, it's the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!",
        "Announcer: From New York City, New York! Appearing in his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut! He's known for his confrontational business style. Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing Pete Beck-errrr!!",
        "[Pete enters with his entourage all pumped up, and Ross and Monica are the only ones who stand up and cheer.]",
        "Monica: I love you, Pete!!!",
        "Announcer: And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California! He's a 300 pound street fighter, Tank Abbottttttt!!!!",
        "(The crowd goes wild, and Ross is the only one boo-ing him.)",
        "Monica: (going up to the ring) Pete! Pete!! That guy's pretty huge!",
        "Pete: Don't worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponent's strength and weight against him.",
        "Ross: Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.",
        "(Pete and Monica kiss, and Monica mouths \"I love you.\" to him.)",
        "Ross: All right! You go get him! Let's go!",
        "Referee: Here we go gentlemen, here we go! (to Tank Abbott) Are you ready? (He nods, and takes out his teeth) (to Pete) Are you ready? (Pete nods, \"Yes.\") Let's get it on!!",
        "(They both rush each other. Tank picks Pete up and carries him over and slams him into the fence surrounding the ring.)",

        "Pete: It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant \"You suck!\"",
        "Monica: I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.",
        "Pete: What, look back?",
        "Monica: Well, you're not gonna get going are you?",
        "Pete: Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?",
        "Monica: Well, no. But...",
        "Pete: Well I'm not gonna stop until I'm the Ultimate Fighting Champion.",
        "Monica: That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!",
        "Pete: Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad's garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.",
        "Monica: You didn't know that already?",
        "Pete: Look, I'm gonna get better. Okay? I promise you.",
        "Monica: Okay, just get a lot better. (pause) Fast.",

        "Ross: Hot dog?",
        "Monica: Four, please. (Ross looks at her) I'm really nervous. (Ross gives her the four dogs) Thank you. (she grabs four buns, and heads back inside)",
        "Phoebe: So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?",
        "Ross: What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn't expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now, but she's really terrific.",
        "Phoebe: Ohh, that's too bad!",
        "Ross: No, I-I'm saying I liked her.",
        "Phoebe: Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.",
        "Ross: Pheebs, I think she's great. Okay? We're going out again.",

        "Ross: Okay, we'll be right in. (to Chandler) So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?",
        "Chandler: Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it's gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I'm conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.",

        "Doug: (turning around) Bing! You got those numbers for me?",
        "Chandler: No, I ah, I didn't do them.",
        "Doug: Oh, you forgot?",
        "Chandler: No, no I just ah, didn't do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don't deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.",
        "Doug: Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller. (laughs) That's okay, you're still my number one guy! (slaps him on the butt) Bing!",
        "Chandler: Doug!!",
        "Doug: Hmm.",
        "Chandler: I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.",
        "Doug: Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!",
        "Chandler: No, no. It-it's not about the swearing, it's more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.",
        "Doug: Oh?",
        "Chandler: Oh, and don't get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It's just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it's making all the other guys jealous.",
        "Doug: Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing! You're okay.",
        "Chandler: Okay. (he starts to leave)",
        "Doug: Ha! (goes to smack him on the butt, but stops, faking Chandler out) Ahhhhhhh!",

        "(We see Ross and Bonnie laughing and having a good time.)",

        "Phoebe: (looking in the window) Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let's go.",
        "Rachel: Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that's, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that's what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...",
        "Phoebe: Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.",

        "Phoebe: You said it was okay!",
        "Rachel: You said she was bald!!",
        "Phoebe: What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!",
        "Rachel: Phoebe, we can't, we just can't just let it happen! Okay, we have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!!",
        "Phoebe: Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don't get it. Aren't you the one that decided that you didn't want to be with Ross?",
        "Rachel: (quietly) Yes.",
        "Phoebe: Well isn't he your friend? Don't you want him to be happy?",
