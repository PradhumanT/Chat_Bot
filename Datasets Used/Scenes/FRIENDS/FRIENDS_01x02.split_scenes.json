        "RACHEL: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.",
        "MONICA: Absolutely.",
        "CHANDLER: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.",
        "ROSS: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.",
        "CHANDLER: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.",
        "RACHEL: Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.",

        "MARSHA: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!",

        "CHANDLER: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (OFF MONICA'S LOOK) ...now I wish I was dead.",

        "JOEY: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.",
        "MONICA: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.",

        "MRS. GELLER: Nothing! It's an expression.",
        "MONICA: No it's not.",
        "MR. GELLER: Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...",
        "(CUT TO SAME SCENE)",
        "MR. GELLER: Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.",
        "(AGAIN, CUT TO SAME SCENE)",
        "MR. GELLER: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.",

        "ROSS: (PULLS HIS HAND AWAY) Okay! Okay. (TO MR.+MRS. GELLER) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.",

        "JOEY: Your folks are really that bad, huh?",
        "ROSS: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.",
        "MONICA: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (TO ROSS) -I'd want yours.",
        "ROSS: Must pee. (GOES TO PEE)",

        "RACHEL: A lot.",
        "ROSS: Mm.",
        "RACHEL: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?",
        "ROSS: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...",
        "RACHEL: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?",
        "ROSS: Got me.",
        "RACHEL: Remember when we were in high school together?",
        "ROSS: Yeah.",
        "RACHEL: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (ROSS GAZES AT HER) ..Ross?",

Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose.
