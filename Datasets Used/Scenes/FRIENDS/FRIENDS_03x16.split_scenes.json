        "Monica: Okay, all right don't judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....",

        "Chandler: Oh my God! Oh my God!",
        "Joey: Yeah. We figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?",
        "Ross: You think?! God, I, ah, I'm in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel's all like, 'I love you and, and let's work on this.' And all I can think about is, 'What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?' when I tell her what I did.",
        "Chandler: Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?",
        "Ross: What?! Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?",
        "Joey: Look, Ross look, I'm on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.",
        "Chandler: He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her.",
        "Joey: Yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.",
        "Ross: Yeah, but don't you think....",
        "Chandler: All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing's right. And that's what deathbeds are for.",
        "Ross: Yeah, okay. (he plops down into one of the leather chairs, with the footrest extended.)",
        "Joey: All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way. (spins the chair around so that Ross is facing him) Did you think about the trail?",
        "Ross: What trail?",
        "Joey: (stomps on the footrest which pops Ross up into a sitting position) The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! (slapping his hands with each word) You always have to think about the trail!",
        "Ross: Oh, I-I don't think there's any trail.",
        "Chandler: Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac's sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe's friends with Rachel. And that's the trail, I did it!",
        "[Scene: Monica's Bedroom, Monica and Phoebe are waxing their legs.]",
        "Phoebe: (reading from the instructions) After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,",
        "Monica: Did that!",
        "Phoebe: Grasp one of the linen strips by its 'easy grab tab' and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.",
        "Monica: Okay. (Does so.) Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!",
        "Phoebe: Was it not pain-free?",
        "Monica: No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.",
        "Phoebe: Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.",
        "Monica: That's because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don't believe me, please, by my guest.",
        "Phoebe: (Removing one of the strips) Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!",
        "Monica: Now, are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?",
        "[Scene: The Xerox Place, Ross is trying to break the trail.]",

        "Chloe: Is this about me taking your watch?",
        "Ross: You took my watch?",
        "Chloe: I'm sorry, I do that.",
        "Ross: Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?",
        "Chloe: Oh no. I feel it isn't really anybody's business, y'know.",
        "Ross: Exactly. So you didn't, didn't mention anything to Issac right?",
        "Chloe: Oh, well I tell Issac everything.",
        "Ross: You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven't actually met...",
        "Issac: You dog!",
        "Ross: Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.",
        "Issac: Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.",
        "Ross: Yeah, that's the one. Listen, I don't want to hurt her.",
        "Issac: Oh, hey, man I know, doesn't matter how much we love 'em, monogamy is too cruel a rule.",
        "Ross: Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?",
        "Issac: Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. We're the same, you and me.",
        "Ross: Actually, no, we're not.",
        "Issac: Yeah, we are.",
        "Ross: No, we're not.",

        "Jasmine: Very bad!",
        "Ross: Very bad.",
        "Jasmine: Very, very bad.",
        "Ross: I'm agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?",
        "Jasmine: No.",
        "Ross: Okay, Jasmine, please, please don't. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?",
        "Jasmine: All right.",
        "Ross: Thank you, thank you.",
        "Jasmine: But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he knows Phoebe too.",

        "Monica: We were just waxing our legs.",
        "Chandler: Off?!!",
        "Phoebe: For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.",
        "Chandler: Yeah, well I don't think you can make that statement, unless you've been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.",
        "Joey: Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that's all. I mean, come on, it's just a little wax.",
        "Phoebe: Oh yeah, come here. (Puts a little wax on Joey's arm and puts a strip on it.)",
        "Chandler: Oh, that's mature.",

        "Rachel: Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? (Ross can't answer that) Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!",
