        "Chandler, frustrated by Joey's loud snoring, takes him to a sleep clinic where he meets an attractive woman with her own sleeping issues. Rachel, struggling to accept Ross and Emily's engagement, shocks Joshua by saying they should get married. Monica and Phoebe pick up Emily's wedding gown at the bridal shop. Monica tries it on and does not want to take it off, then puts it on again at home. Phoebe then shows up in a rented wedding dress. Rachel leaves Joshua a phone message explaining she was just upset about Ross and Emily. She never expects to see Joshua again. The girls try cheering Rachel up by getting her to wear her old wedding dress, only for Joshua to show up. Seeing her in a bridal gown, he runs off for good."

        "Joey: Yeah, Rach, I think you're handling that really well.",
        "Rachel: Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There's nothing to handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and Joshua. Y'know, they're not gonna get married anyway!",
        "Chandler: What?",
        "Rachel: Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it's ridiculous! I mean, they're gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they've done and they're call the whole thing off. I'm telling ya, you're gonna be dancing at my wedding before you're dancing at there's.",
