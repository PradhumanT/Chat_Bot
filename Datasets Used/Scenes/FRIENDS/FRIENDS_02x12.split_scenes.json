    "Recap": [
        "Ross goes to visit Marcel while in California but the zoo says the monkey died. Ross soon learns Marcel is alive and working in commercials. Joey receives his first fan letter from a beautiful but crazed woman ( Brooke Shields ) who believes Days of Our Lives is real, a fact that does not prevent Joey from dating her. A man ( Chris Isaak ) invites Phoebe to sing for children at the library, but her morbid lyrics horrify parents. However, the kids like the songs for telling the truth and come to the caf\u00e9 to listen to her. Rachel and Monica compete for Jean-Claude Van Damme after meeting him on a movie set that Marcel is in. Chandler runs into Suzy, a former schoolmate ( Julia Roberts ), working on the film. She seems attracted to him, but actually wants revenge for Chandler once humiliating her in school. Joey is hired as an extra in the movie but overacts. Ross and Marcel spend time together."

        "CHANDLER: Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.",
        "ROB: You OK?",
        "PHOEBE: No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.",
        "ROB: That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired.",
        "PHOEBE: I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?",
