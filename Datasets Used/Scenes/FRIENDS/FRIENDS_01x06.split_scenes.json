        "Chandler dates Aurora ( Sofia Milos ), a beautiful, exotic woman that he soon learns is married and has another boyfriend. Chandler is initially fine having a polyamorous relationship, but is unable to handle yet another lover being added to the mix. Joey's new talent agent, Estelle Leonard, gets him a film role as a stand-in for Al Pacino's butt double. However, he is fired because he \"overacts\" with it. Rachel cleans the apartment, but triggers Monica's obsessive-compulsive tendencies after moving some furniture around."

        "CHANDLER: Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the s*x; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!",

        "MONICA: That is so unfair!",
        "ROSS: Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!",
        "MONICA: Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.",
        "ROSS: Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.",
        "MONICA: Why not?",
        "ROSS: Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.",
        "MONICA: I could do that.",
        "RACHEL: Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.",
        "MONICA: Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.",
        "CHANDLER: Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...",
        "MONICA: STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?",

        "RACHEL: Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?",
        "CHANDLER: No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?
