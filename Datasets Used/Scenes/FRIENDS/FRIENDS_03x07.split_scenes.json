Things end badly after Rachel tries to get her father and Ross to bond during dinner out together. To make amends, Rachel sets up a brunch only for it to backfire on her when Ross and Dr. Green bond over criticizing her. Joey teaches a soap opera acting class. When Joey and the student are up for the same part in a soap opera, Joey tries sabotaging the student's chances by suggesting he play the character, a boxer, as being gay.

Now um, on my first day as (proudly) Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives, (looks for a reaction from his students, and gets none.) I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don't have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like this. (looks all intense for a moment and then gasps, the students cheer him) Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along.",

        "Ross: Ugh, museum.",
        "Dr. Green: What happened to the library?",
        "Ross: There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one.",
        "Dr. Green: You know what's really good here, the lobster. What do you say shall I just order three.",
        "Ross: Yeah, if you're really hungry. (Dr. Green stares at him) It was a joke, I made a joke.",
        "Rachel: Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.",
        "Dr. Green: What kind of person is allergic to lobster? I guess the kind of person that works at a library.",
        "Ross: It's not a library...",
        "Dr. Green: (interrupting him) I know!! It's a museum! What, you're the only one around here who can make a joke! At least mine was funny. Ah, waiter, we will have two lobsters and a menu. (nods at Ross, and mouths I don't know to the waiter.)",

        "Rachel: Aw honey stop! It's not that bad.",
        "Ross: Yeah. (sees the bill) Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must've added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.",
        "Rachel: Yeah. That's Daddy.",
        "Ross: That's Daddy?! But doesn't it bother you? You're a waitress.",
        "Rachel: Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I'd be serving him sneezers.",
        "Ross: So?",
        "Rachel: So. Ross, I've bugged him about this a million times, he's not gonna change.",
        "Ross: You really serve people sneezers?",
        "Rachel: Well um, I don't.",
        "Dr Green: You kids ready?",

        "Dr. Green: Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I think I forgot my receipt.",
        "Ross: Oh, ah, you don't need that.",
        "Dr. Green: Why not?",
        "Ross: The carbon, it's messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness.",
        "Dr. Green: (gets his receipt and notices the twenty) What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh?",
        "Ross: Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it's a sickness really.",
        "Rachel: Yeah it is, it is. (to Ross) We really, really have to do something about that.",
        "Ross: I know.",
        "Dr. Green: Excuse me, you think I'm cheap?",
        "Rachel: Oh Daddy, no he didn't mean anything by that, he really didn't.",
        "Ross: Nothing I do means anything, really.",
        "Dr. Green: This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot? Here, I'll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right. (rips up the bill, and throws it at Ross, then leaves)",
        "Ross: Well Mr. Big Shot is better than 'wethead'.",
        "[Scene: Classroom, Joey is lecturing on facial expressions.]",
        "Joey: Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' (Does it by raising one eyebrow, and showing off the pretend fishhook.) Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. (looks all confused) And that's how it's done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.",
        "Student: Hey, Mr. Trib.",
        "Joey: Hey-hey.",
        "Student: Guess what, I got an audition!",
        "Joey: Awww, one of my students got an audition. I'm so proud.",
        "Student: I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?",
        "Joey: You bet! What's the part?",
        "Student: Oh it's great, it's a role on All My Children, Nick the boxer.",
        "(Joey does the '232 divided by 13 bad news' look.)",

        "[Scene: Hallway, Ross and Rachel are returning from dinner.]",
        "Rachel: You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone.",
        "Ross: Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.",
        "Rachel: Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. (Ross groans and rubs his neck) Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.",
        "Ross: Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.",
        "(they go into Monica and Rachel's, and see Phoebe hopping around.)",
        "Ross: Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?",
        "Phoebe: I'm, I'm freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn't have! All right, I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?",
        "Rachel: Um. yeah.",
        "Phoebe: I am soo dead. (goes to Monica's room)",
        "Rachel: All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.",
        "Ross: Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn't work.",
        "Rachel: Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here.",
        "Ross: Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!'",
        "Rachel: Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?",
        "Ross: Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along.",
        "Rachel: Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don't wanna have to have a separate room for you too!! (starts to cry)",
        "Ross: Okay, okay, okay. (hugs her) I'll get the bagels.",

        "Monica: Why is this car in my bedroom?",
        "Phoebe: I'm sorry, okay, I-I wasn't looking, and the store says that they won't take it back because you signed for it...",
        "Monica: When did I sign for it?",
        "Phoebe: When I was you! Y'know what, it's all Joey's fault, 'cause he left his nose open!",
        "Monica: Did you make brownies today?",
        "Chandler: Knock, knock.",
        "Monica: (to Phoebe) Quick, take off your dress, he won't notice the bed.",

        "Phoebe: It's Monica's bed. What?",
        "Chandler: Okay. (to Monica) It's a racecar.",
        "Phoebe: So. This has always been Monica's bed, what you're just noticing now, how self-involved are you?",
        "Chandler: Okay, well it this bed isn't new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?",

And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he's got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. (he gets a huge round of applause from his students.) Thank you.",

That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' (Does it by raising one eyebrow, and showing off the pretend fishhook.)
